## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment represents a small number of shares issued to promoters following warrant conversion. The lock-in period of approximately 18 months from the trading commencement date ensures these shares cannot be sold immediately, preventing any dilution concerns. The shares rank equally with existing equity shares in terms of rights and privileges. Trading members should update their records to reflect the new securities.
