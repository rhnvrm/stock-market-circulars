## Summary

BSE has updated the list of securities under the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective January 06, 2026. The circular identifies 8 securities being newly shortlisted for ST-ASM Stage I, 8 securities moving out of the framework, and provides a consolidated list of all securities currently under ST-ASM across different stages. No securities are moving between higher or lower ASM stages in this update.

## Key Points

- 8 new securities shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework effective January 06, 2026
- New inclusions: Baba Arts Ltd, Mangalam Drugs & Organics Ltd, RDB Infrastructure And Power Ltd, Royal Cushion Vinyl Products Ltd, Sita Enterprises Ltd, Sovereign Diamonds Ltd, Super Bakers India Ltd, Vivimed Labs Ltd
- 8 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework: Ceinsys Tech Ltd, Global Capital Markets Ltd, Modi Rubber Ltd, My Money Securities Ltd, POCL Enterprises Ltd, Quantum Digital Vision India Ltd, Sasken Technologies Ltd, Vivid Mercantile Ltd
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages in this update
- Consolidated list includes securities across different ST-ASM stages (I, II, III, etc.)
- Framework applies to both mainboard and SME scrips
- T+0 scrips may be shortlisted based on parent company criteria

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework is a surveillance mechanism that applies additional restrictions on securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or other concerns. Securities under ST-ASM are subject to:

- Enhanced disclosure requirements
- Trading in separate surveillance segment
- Potential price bands and quantity restrictions
- Progressive tightening of measures across stages (I, II, III)

Securities may exit ST-ASM if they are included in other frameworks such as LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge Framework, or ESM.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised list of securities under ST-ASM framework
- Trading members should ensure compliance with applicable restrictions for securities in ST-ASM
- Investors should be aware that securities under ST-ASM may have limited liquidity and higher trading costs
- Surveillance measures apply across all ASM stages with increasing stringency

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 06, 2026 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become effective
- **Circular Date**: January 05, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Securities newly included in ST-ASM framework will face reduced liquidity and increased scrutiny. The 8 securities moving out will see relaxation of surveillance restrictions, potentially improving trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding securities in ST-ASM should expect lower liquidity, wider bid-ask spreads, and potential difficulty in executing large orders. The framework serves as a warning signal for heightened risk.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new ST-ASM list and ensure appropriate risk controls are in place for affected securities.
