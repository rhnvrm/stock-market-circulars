## Summary

BSE has issued a notice (No. 20260227-5) informing trading members that three Treasury Bills — spanning 364-day, 182-day, and 91-day tenors — are set to mature on their respective redemption dates. Trading members are directed to cease all dealing in these T-Bills effective March 02, 2026.

## Key Points

- Three T-Bills are maturing and will be suspended from trading effective March 02, 2026
- Scrip Code 805036 (ISIN: IN002024Z479) — 364TB05326 (364-day T-Bill)
- Scrip Code 805113 (ISIN: IN002025Y230) — 182TB50326 (182-day T-Bill)
- Scrip Code 805151 (ISIN: IN002025X364) — 91TB050326 (91-day T-Bill)
- Reference: DR-831/2025-2026
- Notice issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance & Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard operational notice issued under existing BSE rules governing the maturity and suspension of debt instruments listed on the exchange.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must **not deal** in the three aforementioned T-Bills from March 02, 2026 onwards
- Members holding or facilitating transactions in these instruments must ensure all open positions or trades are settled prior to the suspension date
- Members are advised to take note and update their systems accordingly

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 27, 2026
- **Suspension Effective Date:** March 02, 2026 (T-Bills will cease trading from this date)
- **Redemption Date:** March 02, 2026 (maturity date for all three T-Bills)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt market event with limited broader market impact. The suspension affects only the three named T-Bills in the BSE debt segment. Investors and trading members holding these instruments should expect standard redemption proceeds on the maturity date. No systemic risk or unusual market disruption is anticipated. Members using automated trading systems should ensure these scrip codes are flagged or removed from active trading lists before March 02, 2026.
