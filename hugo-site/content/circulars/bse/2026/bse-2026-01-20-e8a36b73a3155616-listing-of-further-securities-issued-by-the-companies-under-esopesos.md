None of the listed securities are subject to lock-in restrictions.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 20, 2026
- **Effective Trading Date**: January 21, 2026 (Wednesday)

## Impact Assessment

The market impact is expected to be minimal as this represents routine listing of shares issued under employee compensation schemes. The total number of shares across all 8 companies (832,505) represents a relatively small increase in floating stock for each company. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares can be traded immediately, but the volume is not significant enough to materially affect market liquidity or price discovery for any of the listed companies.
