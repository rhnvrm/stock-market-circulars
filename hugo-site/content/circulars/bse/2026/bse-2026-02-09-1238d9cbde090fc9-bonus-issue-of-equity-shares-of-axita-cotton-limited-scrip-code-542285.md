**Market Impact**: The bonus issue will increase the total share capital of Axita Cotton Limited by up to 34,777,250 shares. This may improve liquidity and make the stock more affordable for retail investors due to expected price adjustment post-bonus.

**Trading Impact**: There will be no trading disruption as the prescribed timeline ensures smooth transition. Shares will be available for trading from BOD on the effective listing date, allowing immediate liquidity for bonus shareholders.

**Operational Impact**: The company and its Registrar & Transfer Agent must ensure timely processing to meet the T+1 credit deadline. Exchange systems will need to update corporate action data and adjust prices accordingly for the ex-bonus date.
