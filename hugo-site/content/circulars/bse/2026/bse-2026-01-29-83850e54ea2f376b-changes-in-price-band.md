## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

### Trading Impact
The revised price bands will limit intraday price movements for these securities, with tighter bands (2% for Aptus Pharma and Rotographics) indicating heightened surveillance and volatility control measures. Securities with 10% bands (Colinz Laboratories, Gokak Textiles, and Intec Capital) face moderate restrictions, while Yajur Fibres with a 20% band has the most trading flexibility among the affected securities.

### Market Implications
- Tighter price bands may reduce trading volumes and liquidity
- Investors should be aware of limited price discovery within the bands
- Price band changes typically indicate regulatory concerns about price volatility or trading patterns
- The varying levels suggest different risk profiles and surveillance requirements for each security
