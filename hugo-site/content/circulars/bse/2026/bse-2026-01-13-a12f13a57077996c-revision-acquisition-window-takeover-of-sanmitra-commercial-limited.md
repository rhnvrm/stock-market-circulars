title: Extension of Acquisition Window (Takeover) for Sanmitra Commercial Limited
---

## Summary

BSE has extended the Acquisition Window (Takeover) for Sanmitra Commercial Limited by one additional trading day. The window will now continue through Tuesday, January 20, 2026, excluding the exchange holiday on January 15, 2026 (Thursday) declared for Municipal Corporation Elections in Maharashtra.

## Key Points

- Acquisition window for Sanmitra Commercial Limited extended from Monday, January 19, 2026 to Tuesday, January 20, 2026
- Extension is continuation of previous notice no. 20260101-15 issued on January 01, 2026
- January 15, 2026 (Thursday) is excluded as it is declared as Exchange Holiday
- Holiday declared due to Municipal Corporation Elections in Maharashtra
- Extension adds one trading day to the acquisition window

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is an administrative adjustment to the previously announced acquisition window timeline to account for an intervening exchange holiday.

## Compliance Requirements

- All market participants must note the revised acquisition window timeline
- Trading participants involved in the takeover must adjust their schedules accordingly
- Acquisition window operations must comply with the extended timeline ending January 20, 2026

## Important Dates

- **January 13, 2026**: Circular issued
- **January 15, 2026**: Exchange Holiday (Municipal Corporation Elections in Maharashtra) - Excluded from acquisition window
- **January 19, 2026**: Original end date of acquisition window (Monday)
- **January 20, 2026**: New end date of acquisition window (Tuesday)

## Impact Assessment

The extension has minimal market impact as it affects only participants in the Sanmitra Commercial Limited takeover process. The one-day extension compensates for the exchange holiday and ensures adequate time for acquisition window operations. No broader market implications or changes to takeover regulations.
