title: Discontinuation of Fresh Subscription on Systematic Registration under Certain
  Schemes of Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund
---

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund has announced the discontinuation of fresh subscriptions and switch-in applications for three international equity schemes effective February 10, 2026. The affected schemes are Aditya Birla Sun Life International Equity Fund, Aditya Birla Sun Life Global Emerging Opportunities Fund, and Aditya Birla Sun Life Global Excellence Equity Fund of Fund. Fresh registrations under Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) will not be accepted from the effective date, though existing systematic transactions registered prior to this date will continue to be processed.

## Key Points

- Fresh subscriptions and switch-in applications will be discontinued from February 10, 2026
- Applications received post cutoff timing on the effective date will not be processed
- No fresh SIP and STP registrations will be accepted on or after the effective date
- Existing SIP/STP registrations made before the effective date will continue to be honored
- Three schemes are affected: International Equity Fund, Global Emerging Opportunities Fund, and Global Excellence Equity Fund of Fund
- Changes will be reflected in the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)

## Regulatory Changes

This is an addendum (No. 09/2026) to the existing Scheme Information Document and Key Information Memorandum of the affected schemes. The notice serves to formally update the subscription policies for the three international equity schemes. All other features and terms & conditions of the SID and KIM remain unchanged.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors seeking fresh investments in the three affected schemes must submit applications before the cutoff time on February 10, 2026
- Asset Management Company (AMC) will process only those SIP/STP installments that were registered prior to the effective date
- The AMC will update the SID and KIM documents to reflect these changes
- Distributors and intermediaries must inform potential investors about the subscription suspension

## Important Dates

- **February 9, 2026**: Notice issued
- **February 10, 2026**: Effective date for discontinuation of fresh subscriptions/switch-ins and new SIP/STP registrations
- Post cutoff timing on February 10, 2026: Applications will not be processed

## Impact Assessment

The suspension affects only new investors or existing investors looking to make fresh investments in the three specified international equity schemes. The impact is moderate as existing systematic investment commitments will continue uninterrupted. This measure is typically implemented when schemes reach optimal asset sizes or when fund managers want to maintain portfolio manageability. Investors interested in international equity exposure through Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund will need to explore alternative schemes or submit applications before the deadline. The decision reflects prudent fund management to protect existing investor interests and maintain scheme performance quality.
