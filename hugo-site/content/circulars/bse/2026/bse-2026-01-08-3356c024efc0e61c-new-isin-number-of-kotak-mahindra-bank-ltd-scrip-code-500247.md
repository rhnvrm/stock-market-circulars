- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.5/- to Re.1/-
- Effective Date: January 14, 2026 (Ex-Date)
- Reference: DR-798/2025-2026
- Prior Notice: Exchange Notice No. 20251230-58 dated December 30, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action notification for ISIN change following share sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number INE237A01036
- The new ISIN must be used for all trades executed on or after January 14, 2026
- Members should ensure proper mapping of the old and new ISIN in their trading and settlement systems
- Investors holding shares in demat form will see automatic updates reflected in their holdings

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 8, 2026
- **Ex-Date**: January 14, 2026 (trades on and from this date will use new ISIN)
- **Reference to Prior Notice**: December 30, 2025 (Exchange Notice No. 20251230-58)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to Medium. Share sub-divisions are routine corporate actions that increase liquidity by reducing the per-share price, making shares more accessible to retail investors. The fundamental value of holdings remains unchanged.

**Operational Impact**: Medium. Trading members and brokers must ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN before the ex-date to avoid trade execution or settlement issues. Investors need not take any action as demat accounts will be automatically updated.

**Trading Impact**: The sub-division from Rs.5/- to Re.1/- (5:1 split) will result in shareholders receiving 5 shares for every 1 share held, with the market price adjusting proportionately on the ex-date.
