title: Revised Price Bands for 9 Securities Effective January 16, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 9 securities under enhanced surveillance, with changes effective from January 16, 2026. The price bands have been tightened to ranges between 2% and 10%, indicating increased monitoring by the exchange's surveillance department.

## Key Points

- 9 scrips will have revised price bands effective January 16, 2026
- Price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 10%
- Three securities moved to 5% band: 3C IT Solutions, Amit Securities, Scan Projects, Variman Global
- Four securities set at 10% band: Manaksia Aluminium, Novateor Research, S.M. Gold, Tilak Ventures
- PH Capital Ltd has the most restrictive 2% price band
- Changes apply to equity segment trading
- Notice issued by BSE Surveillance department

## Regulatory Changes

The exchange has implemented tighter price bands as a surveillance measure. Price bands restrict the maximum price movement (up or down) a security can experience in a single trading session, helping to control volatility and protect investors.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands from January 16, 2026
- All trades must comply with new price band restrictions
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect new parameters before the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 14, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 16, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The tightened price bands indicate these securities are under enhanced surveillance, likely due to unusual price movements, volatility concerns, or regulatory requirements. Traders and investors in these securities will face restricted intraday price movement, which may impact liquidity and trading strategies. The 2% band on PH Capital Ltd is particularly restrictive, suggesting heightened regulatory concerns. These measures are designed to protect investors and maintain orderly market conditions.
