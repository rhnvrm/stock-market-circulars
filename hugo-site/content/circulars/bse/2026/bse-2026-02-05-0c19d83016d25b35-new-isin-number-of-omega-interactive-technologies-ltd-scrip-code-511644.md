This new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date of February 6, 2026. This notice is in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20260128-45 dated January 28, 2026.

## Key Points

- Company: OMEGA INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGIES LTD
- Scrip Code: 511644
- New ISIN: INE113B01037
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Old Face Value: Rs.10/- per share
- New Face Value: Re.1/- per share
- Split Ratio: 1:10 (each share of Rs.10 split into 10 shares of Re.1)
- Ex-Date: February 6, 2026
- DR Reference: 815/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action notification following established BSE procedures for ISIN changes due to share sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must use the new ISIN INE113B01037 for all trades in OMEGA shares from February 6, 2026 onwards
- **Market Participants**: Update systems and records to reflect the new ISIN and revised face value
- **Shareholders**: No action required; holdings will be automatically adjusted in demat accounts based on the 1:10 split ratio

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 5, 2026
- **Ex-Date**: February 6, 2026 (new ISIN becomes effective)
- **Reference to Previous Notice**: January 28, 2026 (Notice No. 20260128-45)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10x while reducing the share price proportionally. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors. The ISIN change requires system updates by brokers and trading members.

**Operational Impact**: Trading and settlement systems must be updated to reflect the new ISIN from the ex-date. All pending orders and positions need to be adjusted for the new face value and quantity.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their shareholding quantity multiplied by 10 while the total value remains unchanged. Post-split, the stock may see increased trading volumes due to lower per-share price point.
