## Regulatory Framework

The ST-ASM framework applies 5/15/30 day surveillance stages to securities showing abnormal trading patterns. Securities may move between frameworks based on trading behavior:

- Securities may move to LT-ASM (Long Term ASM) Framework
- Securities may move to Trade for Trade Framework
- Securities may move to GSM (Graded Surveillance Measure) Framework
- Securities may move to Pledge Framework
- Securities may move to ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure) Framework

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 14, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Securities under ST-ASM framework face enhanced surveillance including potential trading restrictions, increased margin requirements, and price bands. Investors trading these securities should be aware of higher volatility risks and stricter monitoring. The addition of 4 securities and stage elevation of 1 security indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny, while 7 securities exiting suggests improved trading behavior or migration to other surveillance frameworks.
