## Impact Assessment

This segment change is generally positive for INDO SMC LIMITED shareholders as the shift from Trade for Trade (MT Group) to Rolling segment (M Group) typically improves liquidity and trading flexibility. The Trade for Trade segment requires full upfront payment and delivery, while the Rolling segment allows for normal T+1 settlement and intraday trading opportunities. This migration suggests the company has met the necessary criteria for graduation to a less restrictive trading segment.
