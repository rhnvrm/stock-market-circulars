## Impact Assessment

This listing is relevant to existing shareholders who participated in PVV Infra Ltd.'s rights issue. The partly paid-up nature of shares (Rs. 1.25/- of Rs. 5/- paid) means shareholders will face future cash call obligations of Rs. 3.75/- per share, payable at the Board's discretion. The large quantum of shares (98.66 million) entering the 'X' group may have limited liquidity implications. Trading members should update their systems with the new scrip details before February 27, 2026.
