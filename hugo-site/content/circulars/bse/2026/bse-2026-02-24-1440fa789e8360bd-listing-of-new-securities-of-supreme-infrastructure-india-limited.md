## Impact Assessment

The listing of 7.10 crore new equity shares will increase the tradable float of Supreme Infrastructure India Limited on BSE. However, a significant portion of these shares (approximately 3.69 crore shares, or ~51.9% of the newly listed lot) is locked in until September 30, 2027, limiting immediate market impact. The remaining ~3.41 crore shares are locked in until September 2026. No shares from this allotment are freely tradable at the time of listing. The preferential allotment at Rs. 86.94/- signals the price at which strategic investors or promoters acquired stakes, which may serve as a reference point for market participants.
