## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects 118 scrips across various market segments. While individual quantities are mostly small, the breadth of impact spans multiple sectors.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - brokers and clearing members with positions in these scrips need to arrange settlement. High-volume auctions (Rajnish Wellness - 65,575 shares, Rama Steel - 30,000 shares) may require significant operational attention.

**Liquidity Impact:** Variable - depends on individual scrip liquidity. Low-volume stocks may face price pressure during auction, while liquid stocks like Reliance, TCS, and NTPC should absorb auction quantities without significant impact.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - primarily affects brokers and institutional participants with settlement obligations. Retail investors generally unaffected unless they have pending delivery obligations in listed scrips.
