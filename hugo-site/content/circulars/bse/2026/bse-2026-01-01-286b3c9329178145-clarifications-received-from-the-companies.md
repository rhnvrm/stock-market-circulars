## Summary

BSE received clarifications from multiple companies (Zydus Wellness Limited, Globus Spirits Limited, Havells India Limited, and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals) regarding significant increase in trading volume of their equity shares. All companies confirmed compliance with SEBI Listing Regulations and stated there is no undisclosed price-sensitive information that could affect their stock's price or volume behavior.

## Key Points

- Companies responded to BSE surveillance queries about abnormal volume increases
- All companies confirmed no pending announcements or undisclosed price-sensitive information
- Companies stated volume increases are purely market-driven with no control or knowledge of specific reasons
- All companies affirmed compliance with Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations & Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015
- Companies confirmed they have made all necessary disclosures from time to time

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must respond to BSE surveillance queries regarding unusual price or volume movements
- Continued adherence to Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 for timely disclosure of material events
- Companies must confirm whether any undisclosed information exists that could affect price/volume behavior

## Important Dates

- January 1, 2026: Date of clarifications received from companies
- Reference emails from BSE dated January 1, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is a routine surveillance activity. The clarifications confirm that the volume increases in these stocks (Zydus Wellness - Code 531335, Globus Spirits, Havells - Scrip Code 517354, and MRPL) are market-driven phenomena without any underlying undisclosed corporate developments. No regulatory action or market restrictions imposed. This demonstrates normal functioning of exchange surveillance mechanisms to ensure market transparency and investor protection.
