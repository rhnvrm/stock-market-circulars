Existing shareholders of LKP Finance Limited (Scrip Code: 507912) will receive 4 additional equity shares for every 1 share held as of the Record Date, resulting in a significant increase in the total number of shares outstanding. Post-bonus, the share price is expected to adjust proportionally (theoretical ex-bonus price ≈ 1/5th of pre-bonus price). The undertaking confirms operational readiness and regulatory compliance. Impact is limited to existing shareholders; broader market impact is low.
