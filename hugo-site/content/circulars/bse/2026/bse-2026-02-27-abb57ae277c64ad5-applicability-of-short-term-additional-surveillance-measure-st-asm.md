## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and investors in the newly listed ST-ASM securities must comply with enhanced margin requirements and applicable trading restrictions under the ST-ASM framework
- Securities under ST-ASM are subject to a 5/15/30-day surveillance cycle with escalating stages
- Members should note that securities marked `*` are shortlisted as per NSE co-listing criteria
- SME scrips (`@`) under ST-ASM are subject to the same surveillance norms applicable to their segment
- For securities exiting ST-ASM into LT-ASM or Trade-for-Trade, the respective framework's compliance norms apply from March 02, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** March 02, 2026 — all additions and removals from the ST-ASM framework take effect
- **Circular Date:** February 27, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Newly Added Securities:** The 8 securities entering the ST-ASM framework will face enhanced surveillance, additional margin requirements, and potential trading restrictions. Retail and institutional investors in these scrips should be aware of increased compliance requirements and possible liquidity impact.

**Exiting Securities:**
- **5 securities** (Faze Three, Fiberweb India, Kavveri Defence, Orient Beverages, Rnit Ai Solutions, Zeal Aqua) transitioning to Trade-for-Trade represent an escalation of surveillance — these scrips will face stricter settlement norms
- **1 security** (Citurgia Biochemicals) moving to LT-ASM indicates longer-term concerns warranting extended surveillance
- **3 securities** (Laffans Petrochemicals, NGL Fine Chem, Ratnamani Metals & Tubes) appear to be exiting without escalation, potentially indicating improved compliance or normalized trading patterns

**SME Segment:** Two SME scrips (Accretion Nutraveda Ltd and Icon Facilitators Ltd) are exiting the framework, while one SME scrip (Shanti Spintex Ltd) is newly added, reflecting continued monitoring of the SME segment.
