## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational circular with medium impact on F&O market participants. The revised schedule ensures smooth settlement operations during the holiday period. Market participants need to plan their liquidity and margin requirements accordingly, particularly for the consolidated settlement on January 16, 2026 which will process trades from two trading days. No disruption to trading operations is expected, only settlement timelines are adjusted. All brokers, trading members, and clearing members must update their settlement calendars and communicate changes to clients involved in derivatives trading.
