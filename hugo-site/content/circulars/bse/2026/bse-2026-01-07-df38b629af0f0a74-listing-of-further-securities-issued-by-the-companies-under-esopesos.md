## Impact Assessment

The impact of this listing is minimal as it represents routine ESOP/ESOS share issuances. The total number of shares (1,011,387) represents a small fraction of the outstanding shares for these established companies. The absence of lock-in periods means these shares are immediately available for trading, though the typical holding pattern of employee stock options suggests limited immediate market pressure. This is a routine corporate action with no expected material impact on stock prices or market operations.
