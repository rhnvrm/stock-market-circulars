## Impact Assessment

This is a routine, low-impact listing notification. The three government T-Bills are standard short-term sovereign debt instruments issued by the Government of India. Their listing expands the tradable debt instrument universe on BSE's debt segment but does not introduce any new risk, compliance obligation, or market structure change. Impact is limited to debt segment participants who may wish to trade these instruments. No equity market impact is expected.
