## Impact Assessment

This is a company-specific listing notification with minimal market-wide impact. The listing represents a capital infusion through preferential allotment via warrant conversion, which will increase the free float of Prospect Consumer Products Limited. The lock-in provisions ensure that a significant portion of these shares (90.13%) cannot be traded until July 2026, with the remaining 9.87% locked until July 2027. This staged lock-in structure limits immediate liquidity impact on the stock.
