title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) - February
  26, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has issued its periodic update to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework, effective February 26, 2026. This update confirms no new securities are being added to LT-ASM (Part A: Nil), no securities are being moved to higher stages (Part B: Nil), no securities are being moved to lower stages (Part C: Nil), and no direct Stage IV additions (Part D: Nil). Three securities are exiting the LT-ASM framework as they have been migrated to other surveillance frameworks (GSM or ESM).

## Key Points

- **No new additions**: Zero securities shortlisted for entry into the LT-ASM framework w.e.f. February 26, 2026 (Parts A & D: Nil)
- **No stage changes**: No securities moved to higher or lower ASM stages (Parts B & C: Nil)
- **Three securities exit LT-ASM**: Gconnect Logitech and Supply Chain Ltd, NDA Securities Ltd, and Rishab Special Yarns Ltd are removed from the LT-ASM framework
- **Exit reasons**: Two securities (Gconnect Logitech, Rishab Special Yarns) exit due to inclusion in the GSM Framework; one security (NDA Securities Ltd) exits due to inclusion in the ESM Framework
- A consolidated list of all securities remaining under LT-ASM continues to apply, with securities categorised under ASM Stages I, II, and III

## Regulatory Changes

The LT-ASM framework remains active with no structural changes. The periodic review results in a net reduction of three securities from the consolidated LT-ASM list. Securities exiting LT-ASM are transitioning to stricter surveillance regimes (GSM or ESM), not returning to normal trading conditions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the removal of the three exiting securities from LT-ASM restrictions effective February 26, 2026
- All securities remaining in the consolidated LT-ASM list (Annexure III) continue to be subject to their respective ASM stage restrictions
- Members should note that the exiting securities are now governed under GSM or ESM frameworks, which carry their own separate restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 26, 2026 — all changes (exits from LT-ASM) come into force
- **Circular Date**: February 25, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Securities Exiting LT-ASM:**
| Scrip Code | ISIN | Company | Exit Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| 544156 | INE0QHY01011 | Gconnect Logitech and Supply Chain Ltd | Moved to GSM Framework |
| 511535 | INE026C01013 | NDA Securities Ltd | Moved to ESM Framework |
| 514177 | INE351D01013 | Rishab Special Yarns Ltd | Moved to GSM Framework |

The overall market impact is limited as no new securities are being placed under surveillance restrictions. However, the three exiting securities are transitioning to even stricter frameworks (GSM/ESM), indicating continued regulatory scrutiny. Investors and traders in these scrips should review the specific trading conditions under the respective new frameworks. The consolidated LT-ASM list in Annexure III remains large, covering securities across ASM Stages I, II, and III, maintaining the broad scope of the surveillance programme.
