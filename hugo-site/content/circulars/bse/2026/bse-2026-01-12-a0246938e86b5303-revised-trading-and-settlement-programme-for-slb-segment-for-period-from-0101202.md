title: Revised Trading and Settlement Programme for SLB Segment - January 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a revised trading and settlement programme for the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) segment for January 2026. The schedule covers 20 settlement cycles from January 1 to January 31, 2026, with detailed timelines for trading dates, depository entry confirmations, and pay-in/pay-out dates.

## Key Points

- Revised settlement schedule covers period from January 1, 2026 to January 31, 2026
- Total of 20 settlement cycles (SL-189/25-26 through SL-209/25-26)
- Settlement numbers range from 2526189 to 2526209
- Pay-in deadline: 8:00 AM on pay-out date
- Members must submit pay-in instructions to Depositories/Banks by 7:50 AM
- Notice issued by Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd.

## Regulatory Changes

This is a schedule revision, not a regulatory change. The revision accounts for trading holidays and ensures proper settlement cycles throughout January 2026.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must adhere to the revised settlement schedule
- Pay-in instructions must be submitted to Depositories/Banks latest by 7:50 AM on pay-out date
- Pay-in must be completed by 8:00 AM on the designated pay-out date
- SLB 6A7A entries and confirmations must be completed on the same day as trading

## Important Dates

- **Effective Period**: January 1, 2026 to January 31, 2026
- **Notable Gaps**: Settlement number SL-199/25-26 is skipped (likely due to trading holiday on January 15, 2026)
- **First Settlement**: SL-189/25-26 - Trading on January 1, Pay-out on January 2
- **Last Settlement**: SL-209/25-26 - Trading on January 30, Pay-out on February 2, 2026
- **Weekend Adjustments**: Pay-outs scheduled for Sundays/holidays are moved to next working day

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - SLB segment participants must update their settlement calendars and operational systems to reflect the revised schedule. The skip in settlement number SL-199 indicates a trading holiday adjustment.

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine operational schedule update that ensures smooth functioning of the SLB segment. No changes to trading mechanisms or settlement processes.

**Participant Action Required**: SLB segment members need to note the revised schedule, particularly the gap at settlement SL-199/25-26 and ensure timely submission of pay-in instructions (by 7:50 AM) to avoid settlement failures.
