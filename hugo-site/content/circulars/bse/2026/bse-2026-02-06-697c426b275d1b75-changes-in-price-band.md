## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements for these 32 securities, potentially reducing volatility and speculative trading activity. Securities with tighter bands (2%-5%) will have more restricted price discovery compared to those with wider bands (10%-20%).

**Trading Impact:**
Traders and investors in these securities will face limitations on maximum price movement per trading session. The majority of affected securities (19 out of 32) have the tightest 5% band, indicating heightened surveillance concerns. This may impact liquidity and trading volumes in these securities.

**Investor Impact:**
Investors should be aware that these price band revisions are part of surveillance measures, typically applied to securities showing unusual price movements, low liquidity, or corporate governance concerns. The action aims to protect investor interests by preventing excessive price manipulation.
