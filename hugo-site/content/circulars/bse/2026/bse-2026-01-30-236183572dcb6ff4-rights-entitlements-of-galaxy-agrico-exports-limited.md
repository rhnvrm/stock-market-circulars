- **February 11, 2026**: Rights Issue closes

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to shareholders of Galaxy Agrico Exports Limited. The 4-day trading window for renunciation provides liquidity for shareholders who do not wish to participate in the rights issue.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members handling Galaxy Agrico Exports clients must ensure proper systems for RE trading, client communication, and disclaimer inclusion in contract notes. T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis requires appropriate operational readiness.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders have flexibility to either subscribe to rights issue, renounce their entitlements through market trading, or let them lapse. Critical that investors understand the distinction between REs and ordinary shares to avoid confusion.
