## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium impact limited to shareholders and potential investors of AVASARA FINANCE LIMITED. Existing shareholders receive tradable rights entitlements that can either be exercised, renounced, or traded during the specified 6-day window. The short renunciation period (January 09-14) requires prompt decision-making by shareholders. Trading members handling clients with AVASA holdings must ensure proper communication and compliance with disclaimer requirements. The dematerialized-only trading requirement and trade-for-trade settlement minimize operational risks. Failure to act by January 19, 2026 will result in lapse of entitlements.
