The market impact of these listings is expected to be negligible. ESOP-related share additions are typically small relative to each company's total outstanding equity. Since there is no lock-in, employees who have exercised their options may sell immediately, but the volumes are unlikely to move prices materially for large-cap names. Natural Capsules (45,000 shares) may see a relatively more noticeable addition given its smaller market cap.
