## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects 176 securities but mostly in small quantities. While major stocks are included, the quantities are relatively small compared to daily trading volumes.

**Broker Impact:** Direct impact on brokers who failed to deliver shares. They will bear auction price differential costs which could be substantial depending on price movements.

**Investor Impact:** Minimal direct impact on retail investors. This is primarily a broker-to-broker settlement mechanism to ensure delivery obligations are met.

**Operational Impact:** Standard auction process ensures market integrity by forcing delivery of sold shares, preventing settlement failures from cascading.
