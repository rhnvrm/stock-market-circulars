## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment of 1,00,200 shares to promoters represents a standard capital raising activity through warrant conversion. The shares are locked in for approximately 19 months until August 2027, preventing immediate selling pressure. The impact on overall market operations and trading activity is negligible given the small issuance size and promoter-only allocation.
