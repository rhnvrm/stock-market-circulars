## Impact Assessment

This circular has a limited and routine market impact. It affects only a single series of privately placed NCDs issued by Bajaj Finance Limited. Market participants holding or trading this specific debenture series must ensure compliance with the no-dealings directive from March 9, 2026. The broader equity or debt market for Bajaj Finance is unaffected. Investors in this NCD will receive redemption proceeds and final interest payment around the maturity date of March 23, 2026.
