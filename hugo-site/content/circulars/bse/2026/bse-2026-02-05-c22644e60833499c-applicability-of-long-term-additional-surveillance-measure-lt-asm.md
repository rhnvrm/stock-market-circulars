- **Trading Members**: Ensure awareness of surveillance measures applicable to these securities
- **Market Participants**: Monitor for any additional margin requirements or trading restrictions
- **Clients**: Be aware that these securities are under enhanced surveillance due to market behavior patterns

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 6, 2026 - All changes to LT-ASM framework become applicable
- **Circular Date**: February 5, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The inclusion of 7 securities in LT-ASM Stage I indicates BSE's proactive surveillance approach to protect investor interests. These securities will face enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of increased scrutiny and potential liquidity constraints. The LT-ASM framework serves as a warning mechanism for unusual market activity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants need to update their systems and processes to reflect the surveillance status of affected securities. Additional margin requirements may apply, affecting capital allocation for trades in these securities.
