## Impact Assessment

This is a high-impact event involving a major government-owned PSU (IRFC) with a substantial offer size of up to 52.27 crore shares. At the floor price of Rs 104, the total OFS value (including greenshoe) could reach approximately Rs 5,436 crore, making this a significant liquidity event for the equity market. Retail investors are guaranteed a 10% reservation, providing broad participation opportunity. Trading members and custodians face operational obligations across both T and T+1 sessions with strict margin and give-up/take-up timelines. Institutional investors with 0% margin bids have extended give-up deadlines extending to T+2 morning. Market participants should ensure readiness on both BSE's iBBS and RTRMS platforms before the OFS opens.
