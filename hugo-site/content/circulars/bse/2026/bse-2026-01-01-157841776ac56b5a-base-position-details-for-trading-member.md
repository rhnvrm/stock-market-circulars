## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Trading members will have enhanced visibility into base positions for stocks in ban period, requiring daily monitoring of position files. This improves risk management capabilities but adds operational overhead for position tracking.

**Risk Management Impact:** Improved transparency and granular position data will strengthen risk monitoring for equity derivatives, particularly for stocks approaching or in ban period. Members can proactively manage positions to avoid breaches.

**Market Impact:** Enhanced surveillance and position tracking may lead to better compliance with position limits and reduced instances of securities entering ban period due to improved member-level monitoring and risk controls.
