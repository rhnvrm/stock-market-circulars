title: Introduction of Daily SIP for WHITEOAK Mutual Fund on BSE StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

WhiteOak Capital Mutual Fund (WOCMF) has introduced a Daily frequency option under the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) facility across all existing schemes, effective February 01, 2026. This new frequency allows investors to make daily SIP contributions on all business days from Monday to Friday, with minimum investment amounts starting from Rs. 100 for equity schemes and Rs. 500 for debt schemes and ELSS Tax Saver Fund.

## Key Points

- Daily SIP frequency introduced across all WhiteOak Capital Mutual Fund schemes
- Effective date: February 01, 2026
- Daily SIP available on all business days (Monday to Friday)
- Minimum investment: Rs. 100 (equity schemes), Rs. 500 (debt schemes and ELSS)
- Minimum 6 installments required
- SIP registration discontinued after 3 consecutive failed installments
- Daily SIP not available for Daily IDCW Plans
- SIP Top-Up frequency limited to half-yearly/yearly for daily SIP
- SIP Pause and Modify facilities not available for daily frequency
- Investors must select "As & when presented" payment frequency in SIP Mandate/OTM

## Regulatory Changes

This is an operational enhancement rather than a regulatory change. The addendum updates the Statement of Additional Information (SAI) and Scheme Information Documents (SIDs) of WhiteOak Capital Mutual Fund schemes to include the new daily SIP frequency option.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors enrolling for Daily SIP must select "As & when presented" as payment frequency in the SIP Mandate/OTM
- Unit allotment subject to realization of credit in the scheme
- If multiple SIP installments are realized on the same day, both will be processed at the applicable NAV per scheme provisions
- AMC/Trustee reserves the right to modify or withdraw the facility

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 01, 2026 - Daily SIP facility becomes operational
- **Notice Date**: January 22, 2026 - Date of official notice

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a product enhancement specific to WhiteOak Capital Mutual Fund and does not affect broader market operations.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for retail investors seeking higher investment frequency and rupee cost averaging benefits. The low minimum amount (Rs. 100) makes daily SIP accessible to small investors.

**Operational Impact**: Limited to WhiteOak Mutual Fund operations and BSE StAR MF platform. The facility provides greater flexibility in investment patterns but comes with restrictions on pause/modify features and requires specific payment mandate setup.

**Limitations**: Daily SIP installments will be skipped on non-business days. The facility excludes Daily IDCW Plans and has reduced flexibility compared to other SIP frequencies (no pause/modify options).
