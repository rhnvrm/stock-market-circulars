## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number INE411D01023
- All trades executed on or after the ex-date must use the new ISIN
- Systems should reflect the new face value of Rs.5/- per equity share
- Members should ensure proper mapping of old and new ISIN for client portfolios

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** January 07, 2026

- **Previous Notice Reference:** December 26, 2025 (Notice No. 20251226-42)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares while reducing the trading price proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and custodians need to update their systems to reflect the new ISIN before the ex-date. Existing shareholders will see their holding quantity doubled while the per-share value is halved, maintaining total investment value. No action is required from shareholders as this is an automatic adjustment.
