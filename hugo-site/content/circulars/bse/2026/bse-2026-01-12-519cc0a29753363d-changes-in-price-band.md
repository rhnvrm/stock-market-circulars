## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their trading systems to reflect the revised price bands
- All trades in the affected securities must comply with the new price band limits from the effective date
- Members requiring clarifications should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Trading systems must be configured to reject orders outside the revised price band limits

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 12, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 13, 2026
- **Implementation**: Revised price bands applicable from start of trading on January 13, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revised price bands will significantly impact trading activity in these 9 securities. Tighter price bands (particularly the 2% band for Bizotic Commercial) will limit intraday volatility and may reduce liquidity. These restrictions typically indicate enhanced surveillance due to concerns about price manipulation, volatility, or compliance issues.

**Trading Impact**: Investors and traders in these securities will face limitations on maximum price movements within a trading day. The 2% band is particularly restrictive and may signal serious surveillance concerns. Securities with 5% bands will have moderate restrictions, while those with 20% bands have relatively more trading flexibility.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their risk management systems and order entry platforms are updated before January 13, 2026 to prevent order rejections and trading disruptions.
