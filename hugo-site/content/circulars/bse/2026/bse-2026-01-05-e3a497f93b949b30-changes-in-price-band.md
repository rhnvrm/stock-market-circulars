## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions are surveillance measures to control price volatility. These restrictions limit the maximum price movement (both upward and downward) that a security can experience in a single trading day from its previous closing price.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure all trades in the affected scrips adhere to the revised price bands
- Orders placed outside the applicable price band will be rejected
- Members should update their risk management systems to reflect the new price bands
- Any clarifications should be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** January 5, 2026
- **Effective Date:** January 6, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The tighter price bands (especially 2% and 5%) will significantly restrict intraday price movements for affected securities, potentially reducing trading volumes and liquidity in these scrips. This may impact traders who rely on volatility for short-term strategies.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their systems and processes to enforce the revised price bands. Investors holding these securities should be aware that price discovery may be constrained due to the restricted trading range.

**Surveillance Context:** These revisions indicate BSE's heightened surveillance on these securities, possibly due to concerns about excessive speculation, price manipulation, or unusual trading patterns. The varying levels of restriction (2% to 20%) suggest different risk profiles across the affected scrips.
