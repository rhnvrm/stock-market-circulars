## Impact Assessment

This corrigendum has a **narrow but material impact** limited to public shareholders of Nirbhay Colours India Limited who intend to participate in the open offer. The revised tendering window (16th February – 2nd March 2026) gives shareholders additional clarity on participation timelines. The update to Clause 7 introduces explicit language on interest liability for the Acquirer in case of delayed payments, offering additional protection to tendering shareholders. There is no broader market-wide impact.
