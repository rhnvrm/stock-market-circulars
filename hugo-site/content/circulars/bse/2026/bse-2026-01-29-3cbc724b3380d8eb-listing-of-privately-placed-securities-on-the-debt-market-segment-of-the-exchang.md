**Issuer Diversity**: Mix of financial services companies (wealth management, consumer finance) and holding companies accessing short-term funding through commercial paper route.

**Credit Quality**: All issuances carry top-tier credit ratings (A1+) from CRISIL, ICRA, and/or CARE, indicating strong creditworthiness.

**Tenure Mix**: Balanced mix of short-term (3-4 months) and medium-term (6-12 months) commercial papers providing investors with various maturity options.

**Trading Implications**: Debt market participants can now trade these securities in standard lots with tight tick size (1 paise) for efficient price discovery.
