## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of approximately 92 million new units represents a significant capital raise through QIP for IndiGrid Infrastructure Trust. This will increase the free float of units and may initially create supply pressure. However, since the allotment is to QIBs (institutional investors), the impact is likely to be measured and orderly.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the expanded unit base. The new units being pari-passu with existing units means no differential treatment is required for corporate actions or dividends.

**Investor Impact**: Existing unitholders will experience dilution proportional to the new issuance. The QIP pricing at Rs. 163 per unit provides a reference point for current valuation. The capital raised will likely be deployed in infrastructure projects, potentially enhancing long-term value for the InvIT.
