title: Scrips Not Available for T+0 Rolling Settlement on March 30, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that 20 equity scrips will not be available for trading in the T+0 (same-day) rolling settlement cycle on Monday, March 30, 2026. Trading in these securities will continue under standard settlement cycles, but the T+0 settlement option will be unavailable for these specific scrips on that date.

## Key Points

- 20 scrips are excluded from the T+0 rolling settlement cycle specifically on March 30, 2026
- The restriction applies only to T+0 settlement; regular T+1/T+2 trading in these scrips remains unaffected
- Affected securities span banking, financial services, insurance, pharma, technology, and consumer sectors
- Notice issued by Head of Trading Operations and Vice President – Trading Operations, BSE
- Notice number: 20260224-23, issued on February 24, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a temporary, date-specific operational restriction on the T+0 rolling settlement cycle for 20 named scrips on March 30, 2026.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure orders for the listed 20 scrips are not routed through the T+0 settlement cycle on March 30, 2026
- Members should update their systems and inform clients who may rely on same-day settlement for these securities
- No action required beyond operational system adjustments for the specified date

## Important Dates

- **February 24, 2026**: Circular issued
- **March 30, 2026 (Monday)**: Date on which T+0 settlement is unavailable for the listed 20 scrips

## Impact Assessment

The restriction affects 20 prominent scrips including Union Bank of India, Coforge, AU Small Finance Bank, Fortis Healthcare, Godrej Properties, Indian Bank, Max Financial Services, Muthoot Finance, One 97 Communications (Paytm), Bajaj Housing Finance, Cummins India, Havells India, HDFC AMC, ICICI Lombard, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, JSW Energy, LIC, Mankind Pharma, Info Edge (Naukri), and Swiggy. Traders and institutional investors who use T+0 settlement for liquidity or same-day position management will need to adjust their strategies for this date. The impact is limited to a single trading session and does not affect normal T+1 settlement trading in these scrips.
