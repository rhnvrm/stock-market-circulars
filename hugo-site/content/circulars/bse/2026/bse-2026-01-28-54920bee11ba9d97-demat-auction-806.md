## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction involves significant quantities in several large-cap stocks, particularly Vodafone Idea (71,475 shares) and Punjab National Bank (24,000 shares), which could see price volatility during auction execution.

**Operational Impact:** Affects brokers and clearing members who have failed to deliver securities in the regular settlement cycle. They must now procure these securities through the auction mechanism, potentially at unfavorable prices.

**Investor Impact:** Clients whose brokers failed to deliver securities may face delayed settlements and potential price differences. The wide variety of scrips (176 securities) indicates systemic delivery issues across multiple trading members.

**Notable Observations:**
- High concentration in telecom (Vodafone Idea), banking (PNB, Indian Bank 8,000 shares), and auto sectors (Tata Motors)
- Presence of recently listed stocks like Swiggy (5,210 shares), Ola Electric, and other new-age tech companies
- Mix of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap securities requiring auction settlement
