## Important Dates

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| March 2, 2026 | NFO subscription opens |
| March 16, 2026 | NFO subscription closes (3:00 PM for SIP/XSIP; midnight for lumpsum) |

## Impact Assessment

This circular is operationally relevant to BSE StAR MF platform members (brokers and distributors) and their mutual fund clients. The NFO introduces two equity FOF schemes and imposes specific transaction and payment timelines that members must communicate to clients. The impact is moderate for participating distributors who need to ensure client compliance with fund transfer and SIP authentication deadlines. No broad market or regulatory impact is anticipated.
