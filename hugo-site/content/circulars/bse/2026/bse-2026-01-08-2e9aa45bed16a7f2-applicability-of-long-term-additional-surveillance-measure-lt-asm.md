title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective January 09, 2026. Six securities have been newly shortlisted for LT-ASM, including Palred Technologies Ltd, Rollatainers Ltd, Sattrix Information Security Ltd, Tahmar Enterprises Ltd, Varyaa Creations Ltd, and Viji Finance Ltd. One security, Soma Papers & Industries Ltd, has been directly placed in Stage IV of LT-ASM. Two securities, Arcee Industries Ltd and Goyal Aluminiums Ltd, are being removed from the LT-ASM Framework. The circular includes a consolidated list of all securities currently under various ASM stages.

## Key Points

- 6 securities newly added to Long Term ASM Framework (Part A)
- 1 security (Soma Papers & Industries Ltd) directly placed in Stage IV LT-ASM
- 2 securities moving out of LT-ASM Framework (Arcee Industries Ltd and Goyal Aluminiums Ltd)
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages within LT-ASM
- Consolidated list provided showing all securities under ASM with their respective stages
- Changes effective from January 09, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework is designed to alert investors about securities demonstrating sustained abnormal price movements and discourage speculative trading. Securities under LT-ASM are subject to additional surveillance measures including price bands, trading restrictions, and increased margin requirements. The framework operates in multiple stages (I through IV) with progressively stricter surveillance measures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with enhanced surveillance requirements for listed securities
- Investors should be aware of additional margins and trading restrictions on LT-ASM securities
- Securities marked with special symbols (*, #, $, &, ~) indicate additional framework applicability or special conditions
- All market participants must adhere to the stage-specific requirements for securities under LT-ASM

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** January 09, 2026 - All LT-ASM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The addition of 6 securities to LT-ASM and movement of 1 security to Stage IV indicates increased regulatory scrutiny on these counters. This will likely reduce speculative trading activity and volatility in these securities. Trading volumes may decrease due to enhanced margin requirements and price bands.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities will face stricter trading conditions including higher margins, reduced liquidity, and price movement restrictions. The removal of 2 securities from LT-ASM provides relief for those counters.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and trading members need to update their risk management systems to reflect the new LT-ASM classifications and ensure proper margin collection and trading controls are in place before the effective date.
