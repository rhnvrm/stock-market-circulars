title: Adjustment of Futures & Options Contracts of Angel One Ltd on Account of Stock
  Split
---

## Summary

BSE has announced mandatory adjustments to all Futures & Options contracts on Angel One Ltd (Derivatives Asset Code: ANOL, Scrip Code: 543235) in accordance with SEBI guidelines for corporate action adjustments. The adjustments are triggered by a 10:1 stock sub-division (split) with a Record Date of February 26, 2026. All contract parameters will be revised at end of day on February 25, 2026.

## Key Points

- Angel One Ltd has fixed **February 26, 2026** as the Record Date for a stock split of 1 equity share of Rs. 10 into 10 equity shares of Rs. 1 each.
- The **adjustment factor is 10** (split ratio 10:1, calculated as 10/1).
- Adjustments will be applied to **all available F&O contracts** on ANOL at end of day on **February 25, 2026**.
- The **ex-date** is February 26, 2026.
- Four contract parameters are affected: strike price, market lot, open positions, and futures price.

## Regulatory Changes

In pursuance of SEBI guidelines for adjustment of Futures & Options contracts on announcement of corporate actions, BSE is required to make the following parameter adjustments:

| Parameter | Adjustment Rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Strike Price | Divide by adjustment factor (10) | 2000 → 200 |
| Market Lot | Multiply by adjustment factor (10) | 250 → 2500 |
| Open Position | Multiply by adjustment factor (10) | Proportional increase |
| Futures Price | Divide by adjustment factor (10); rounded to nearest tick size | Proportional decrease |

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members in the **Equity Derivatives Segment** must account for revised contract specifications effective February 26, 2026.
- All order management systems and risk parameters must reflect the new market lot of **2500** and adjusted strike prices.
- Members are advised to contact their designated Relationship Managers at BSE for clarifications.
- No action is required to convert existing positions — the Exchange will apply adjustments automatically at end of day February 25, 2026.

## Important Dates

- **February 20, 2026** — BSE Notice issued (Notice No. 20260220-17)
- **February 25, 2026 (End of Day)** — Adjustment applied to all ANOL F&O contracts
- **February 26, 2026** — Ex-date and Record Date for stock split

## Impact Assessment

This is a high-impact operational notice for derivatives traders holding or planning positions in Angel One Ltd (ANOL). The 10:1 split adjustment effectively reduces per-share contract values by a factor of 10 while increasing market lot size tenfold, keeping notional contract value neutral. However, margin requirements, tick-level pricing, and system configurations for ANOL contracts will all need to be updated. Traders with existing open positions in ANOL F&O should verify their risk exposure post-adjustment. The increased lot size (250 → 2500) may affect retail participation and liquidity dynamics in the ANOL derivatives market.
