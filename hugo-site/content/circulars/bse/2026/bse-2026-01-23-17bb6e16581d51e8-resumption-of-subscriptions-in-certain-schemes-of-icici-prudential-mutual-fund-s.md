title: Resumption of Subscriptions in ICICI Prudential US Bluechip, NASDAQ 100, and
  Strategic Metal & Energy Funds
---

## Summary

ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund has announced the resumption of subscriptions in three schemes: ICICI Prudential US Bluechip Equity Fund, ICICI Prudential NASDAQ 100 Index Fund, and ICICI Prudential Strategic Metal and Energy Equity Fund of Fund. The resumption is effective from January 27, 2026, with investment limits of ₹2 lakhs per PAN per month per scheme across all investment modes including lump sum, SIP, and STP. The limits apply only to fresh subscriptions while existing systematic transactions will continue without limits.

## Key Points

- Subscriptions resume in three ICICI Prudential schemes from January 27, 2026
- Overall investment limit: ₹2 lakhs per PAN per month per scheme (cumulative across all modes)
- Daily SIP/STP limit: ₹10,000
- Weekly SIP/STP limit: ₹50,000
- Fortnightly SIP limit: ₹1,00,000
- Monthly SIP/STP limit: ₹2,00,000
- Quarterly SIP/STP limit: ₹6,00,000
- Limits apply only to fresh subscriptions and new systematic registrations
- Existing systematic transactions/instalments continue without any limits
- Special products like Freedom SIP, SIP Top Up, Booster SIP, Flex STP, Booster STP, Capital Appreciation STP, and Trigger facilities will be available
- AMC may discontinue subscriptions if overseas investment nears capped limit

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational decision by ICICI Prudential Trust Limited to manage overseas investment limits in international and commodity-focused funds.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors must adhere to the ₹2 lakhs per PAN per month per scheme limit for fresh investments
- Investment limits are applicable across all frequencies and modes (lump sum, switch, SIP, STP) on a cumulative basis
- Frequency-specific SIP/STP limits must be observed as per the schedule provided
- Investors are requested to periodically review and update their KYC details including mobile number and email ID

## Important Dates

- **January 21, 2026**: Circular issuance date
- **January 27, 2026**: Effective date for resumption of subscriptions with specified limits

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The reopening provides investment opportunities in international and commodity funds that were previously closed, but with capped limits to manage overseas investment exposure.

**Investor Impact**: Investors seeking exposure to US equities (Bluechip and NASDAQ 100) and strategic metals/energy can now make fresh investments within prescribed limits. The ₹2 lakh monthly cap may restrict larger investors but protects the fund from exceeding overseas investment limits. Existing SIP/STP investors are unaffected and can continue their investments without limits.

**Operational Impact**: The AMC retains flexibility to suspend subscriptions again if overseas investment approaches regulatory limits, ensuring compliance with SEBI's overseas investment caps for mutual funds.
