title: Revision of Price Bands for 11 Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 11 securities effective January 14, 2026. The changes include varied price band percentages ranging from 2% to 20%, indicating different levels of trading restrictions based on surveillance requirements. Trading members have been notified to implement these revised bands from the effective date.

## Key Points

- 11 scrips will have revised price bands effective January 14, 2026
- Price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive among revised securities)
- Admach Systems, Apollo Techno Industries, Bai-Kakaji Polymers, and Nanta Tech set at 20% bands
- Maruti Interior Products has the most restrictive band at 2%
- Global Ocean Logistics and Rukmani Devi Garg Agro Impex set at 10% bands
- Photoquip India, Precision Electronics, Spinaroo Commercial, and Vashishtha Luxury Fashion set at 5% bands

## Regulatory Changes

The price band revisions represent enhanced surveillance measures for the affected securities. Price bands limit the maximum price movement (up or down) allowed for a security in a single trading session. Tighter bands indicate greater regulatory scrutiny and aim to curb excessive volatility or speculative activity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement the revised price bands from January 14, 2026
- All trading systems and risk management frameworks must be updated to reflect the new price band limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Trading in these scrips must adhere to the new percentage limits for daily price movements

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** January 13, 2026
- **Effective Date:** January 14, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements for these 11 securities, potentially reducing volatility and speculative trading. Securities with tighter bands (2%-5%) face more significant trading restrictions.

**Trading Impact:** Investors and traders in these scrips will experience limited price discovery within the specified bands. Orders placed beyond the price band limits will be rejected.

**Surveillance Context:** The varied price band percentages suggest different risk profiles among the securities, with Maruti Interior Products (2% band) under the strictest surveillance measures.

**Liquidity Impact:** Tighter price bands may reduce liquidity as price movements are constrained, though they also provide protection against extreme volatility.
