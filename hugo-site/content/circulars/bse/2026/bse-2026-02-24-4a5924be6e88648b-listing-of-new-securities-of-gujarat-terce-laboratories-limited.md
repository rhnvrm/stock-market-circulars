## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for newly allotted securities pursuant to a preferential issue.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the new securities listed under Scrip Code 524314
- The entire allotment of 3,71,000 shares is subject to lock-in and cannot be traded until June 16, 2027
- Lock-in applies to distribution numbers 74,20,301 to 77,91,300

- **Trading Commencement Date:** February 25, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry Date:** June 16, 2027

## Impact Assessment

The listing of these preferential shares has minimal immediate market impact as all 3,71,000 shares are under lock-in until June 16, 2027, meaning they cannot be freely traded. The allotment increases the total share capital of Gujarat Terce Laboratories Limited. Broader market participants are unlikely to be affected; the primary implication is for the company's promoter shareholding structure.
