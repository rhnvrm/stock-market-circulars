## Regulatory Framework

The Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) is a progressive surveillance framework that places additional requirements on securities based on specific criteria. Higher GSM stages typically involve:

- Additional margins and trading restrictions
- Price bands limitations
- Disclosure requirements for investors
- Enhanced monitoring by the exchange

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors trading in these securities must comply with enhanced margin requirements applicable to the respective GSM stage
- Trading members must ensure adequate disclosures to clients regarding GSM applicability
- Additional due diligence required before trading in these securities

## Impact Assessment

The movement of securities to higher GSM stages indicates concerns regarding price volatility, corporate governance, or other risk factors. This can result in:

- Reduced liquidity due to higher trading costs
- Increased margins required for trading
- Potential investor caution leading to lower trading volumes
- Enhanced scrutiny from regulatory authorities

Investors holding positions in these securities should review their holdings and understand the implications of GSM applicability on their investment strategy.
