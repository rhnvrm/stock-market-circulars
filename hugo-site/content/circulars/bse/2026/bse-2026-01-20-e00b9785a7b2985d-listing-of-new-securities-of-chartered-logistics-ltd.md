## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The issuance represents a preferential allotment of 35 lakh shares, which is relatively modest in size. The shares are issued to Non-Promoters through warrant conversion.

**Lock-in Impact**: All 35,00,000 shares are subject to lock-in periods ranging from July 31, 2026 to August 1, 2026, which will restrict immediate trading and liquidity impact.

**Shareholder Impact**: The new shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares, providing equal rights to the new shareholders. The preferential issue may result in dilution for existing shareholders depending on the company's pre-issue capital structure.
