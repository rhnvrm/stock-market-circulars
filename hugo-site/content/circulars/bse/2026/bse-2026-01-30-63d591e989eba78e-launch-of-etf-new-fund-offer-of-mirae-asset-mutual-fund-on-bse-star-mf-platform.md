## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it announces a routine NFO launch on the BSE StAR MF Platform. The impact is limited to:

- Members and investors interested in defence sector ETF exposure
- BSE StAR MF Platform participants who need to configure systems for the new scheme
- No impact on existing listed securities or broader market operations
- Standard NFO procedures and timelines apply with no special conditions

The launch provides investors with a new thematic investment option in the defence sector but does not affect existing market infrastructure or trading rules.
