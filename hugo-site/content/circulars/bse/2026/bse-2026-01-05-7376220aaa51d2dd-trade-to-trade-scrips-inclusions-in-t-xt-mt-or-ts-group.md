- Higher capital requirements for traders (no leverage through intraday)

**Market Implications:**
- Movement indicates regulatory concerns about price manipulation or abnormal price movements
- Likely to see reduced trading volumes in affected scrips
- Investors holding these securities face reduced exit flexibility
- SME security Tranway21 Technologies faces additional scrutiny with TS group classification

**Investor Considerations:**
- Existing shareholders need to be aware of reduced liquidity
- Only suitable for delivery-based investors, not suitable for day traders
- Heightened surveillance suggests potential corporate governance or compliance issues
- 26 securities remaining in trade-for-trade segment continue under surveillance
