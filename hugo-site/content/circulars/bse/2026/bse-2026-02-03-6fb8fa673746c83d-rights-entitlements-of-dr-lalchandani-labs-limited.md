## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium impact on shareholders and trading members of DR LALCHANDANI LABS LIMITED. Existing shareholders receive rights entitlements that can be exercised, sold, or allowed to lapse. The 14-day renunciation window (February 04-17) provides adequate time for shareholders to make informed decisions. Trading members must ensure proper client communication and compliance with disclosure requirements to avoid investor confusion between REs and ordinary shares. The trade-for-trade settlement mechanism ensures transparent price discovery for the rights entitlements.
