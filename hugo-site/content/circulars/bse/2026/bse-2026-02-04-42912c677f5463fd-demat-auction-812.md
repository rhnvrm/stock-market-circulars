**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects 142 securities but this is a routine clearing mechanism. Auction activities may cause temporary price volatility in affected scrips.

**Operational Impact**: Specific impact on brokers and traders who failed to deliver securities. They must either arrange shares or participate in auction, potentially at unfavorable prices.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders of listed companies are not directly affected unless they are part of the delivery failure chain. The auction ensures settlement integrity and protects buyers who were expecting delivery.
