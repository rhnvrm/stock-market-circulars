title: Schedule of Client Collateral Segregation Reporting on account of Live Trading
  Session on Sunday, 1st February 2026 - Presentation of Union Budget
---

## Summary

Indian Clearing Corporation Limited has issued a modified schedule for client collateral segregation reporting due to the live trading session scheduled on Sunday, February 1, 2026, on account of the Union Budget presentation. The circular adjusts reporting cut-off dates for trades executed between January 30 and February 2, 2026.

## Key Points

- Special trading session on Sunday, February 1, 2026 due to Union Budget presentation
- Modified reporting schedule affects trades from January 30 to February 2, 2026
- Non-submission of client collateral segregation reporting will be treated as non-compliance
- Penalties for non-submission will be applicable as per existing circular provisions
- All clearing members must comply with the revised schedule

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a temporary schedule modification to accommodate the special trading session on a Sunday.

## Compliance Requirements

**Clearing Members must submit client collateral segregation reports according to the following schedule:**

| Trade Date | Cut Off Date |
|------------|-------------|
| January 30, 2026 | February 2, 2026 |
| January 31, 2026 | February 2, 2026 |
| February 1, 2026 | February 2, 2026 |
| February 2, 2026 | February 3, 2026 |

**Important:** Non-submission will result in penalties as per circular provisions.

## Important Dates

- **January 28, 2026**: Notice issued
- **January 30, 2026**: First trade date covered by modified schedule
- **February 1, 2026**: Special live trading session (Sunday) - Union Budget presentation
- **February 2, 2026**: Cut-off date for reporting trades from January 30, 31, and February 1
- **February 3, 2026**: Cut-off date for reporting trades from February 2

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Clearing members must adjust their reporting workflows to accommodate the modified schedule, particularly for the Sunday trading session.

**Market Impact:** Low - This is an administrative adjustment that ensures proper collateral segregation reporting during a special trading session. It does not affect trading operations directly.

**Compliance Impact:** Medium - Members must ensure timely submission according to the revised schedule to avoid penalties. The consolidation of multiple trade dates to a single cut-off date (February 2 for three trade dates) requires attention.
