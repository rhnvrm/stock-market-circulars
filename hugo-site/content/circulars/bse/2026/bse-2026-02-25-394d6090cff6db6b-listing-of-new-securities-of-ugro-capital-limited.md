## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 1,780,302 equity shares to the tradeable float of UGRO Capital Limited, representing a modest increase in share supply. As the shares were issued to non-promoters at Rs. 264.00 per share (a set issue price), market participants should note any price differential with the current market price. The absence of a lock-in period means these shares can be freely traded from the effective date, which may exert short-term selling pressure depending on market conditions. Overall impact is moderate and limited to UGRO Capital shareholders and prospective investors.
