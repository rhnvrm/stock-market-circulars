title: Changes in Price Band for 12 Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for 12 securities effective February 6, 2026, as part of its surveillance measures. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20%, replacing their existing levels. Trading members are required to ensure compliance with the new price band limits for these scrips.

## Key Points

- 12 scrips will have revised price bands effective February 6, 2026
- Price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive)
- Four securities receive 2% price band: Anirit Ventures, Continental Controls, and SVP Global Textiles
- One security (Aritas Vinyl) receives the highest 20% price band
- Five securities receive 5% price band restrictions
- Four securities receive 10% price band restrictions
- Changes are part of BSE's surveillance framework

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements revised trading restrictions through price band adjustments. Price bands limit the maximum price movement (up or down) that a security can experience in a single trading day. Tighter price bands (lower percentages) indicate higher surveillance concern and restrict volatility.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement the revised price bands in their trading systems before market opening on February 6, 2026
- All trades in the affected scrips must comply with the new price band limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Systems must reject orders that would breach the revised price bands

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 5, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 6, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects liquidity and trading activity in 12 specific securities. Traders and investors in these scrips will face restricted price movements, potentially impacting intraday trading strategies.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their risk management systems and surveillance tools to incorporate the new price bands. The tighter bands (particularly 2% and 5%) significantly restrict trading ranges and may impact order execution.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders and active traders in these securities should expect reduced volatility and potentially lower liquidity. Exit or entry strategies may need adjustment due to the constrained price movement limits.
