## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in the 9% Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of Kosamattam Finance Limited effective January 23, 2026. The suspension is being implemented due to the company fixing the record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the no-dealings date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies to KFL 9% NCDs with ISIN INE403Q07CT7 (Scrip Code: 938121)
- Record date set for January 23, 2026 for both redemption and interest payment
- No dealings permitted from January 23, 2026 onwards
- Notice reference number: DR-805/2025-2026
- Circular issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action notification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures (ISIN: INE403Q07CT7) from January 23, 2026
- Members must take note of the suspension and ensure compliance with the no-dealings restriction
- All trading activity in these NCDs must cease before the record date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** January 16, 2026
- **Record Date:** January 23, 2026
- **No Dealings From:** January 23, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - The suspension affects only a single debt security of Kosamattam Finance Limited. This is a standard corporate action that occurs when debentures are being redeemed. Impact is limited to existing holders of these specific NCDs.

**Investor Impact:** Debenture holders will receive their redemption proceeds and final interest payment as per the scheduled record date. No trading will be possible from the suspension date, which is standard practice for such corporate actions.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal - Trading members need to update their systems to block trading in this specific ISIN from January 23, 2026. This is a routine operational adjustment for debt market participants.
