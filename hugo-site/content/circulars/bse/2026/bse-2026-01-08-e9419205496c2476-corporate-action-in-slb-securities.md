## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium impact on market operations, specifically affecting Securities Lending and Borrowing activities. During the shut periods, SLB participants will be unable to transact in these securities. The bonus issue for Authum Investment may create short-term volatility and requires position adjustments. Dividend declarations for Godrej Consumer Products and Angel One are routine corporate actions with limited market disruption. Market participants with existing SLB positions in these securities must ensure compliance with foreclosure dates to avoid settlement issues.
