title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective January 27, 2026. The circular identifies securities being newly added to the framework, securities moving between different ASM stages, and securities exiting the ST-ASM framework due to inclusion in other surveillance mechanisms.

## Key Points

- 6 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework
- 1 security (Logiciel Solutions Ltd) moving to higher Stage ASM while continuing in ST-ASM
- 1 security (Western Overseas Study Abroad Ltd) moving to lower Stage ASM while continuing in ST-ASM
- 10 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework for various reasons including inclusion in LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, and ESM frameworks
- Consolidated list provided showing all securities currently under ST-ASM with their respective stages
- Framework includes SME scrips and T+0 scrips with special markings

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities based on short-term price movements and volatility. Securities are classified into different stages (I, II, III) with progressively stringent trading restrictions.

**New Additions to ST-ASM (Stage I):**
- Baazar Style Retail Ltd (544243)
- Forbes & Company Ltd (502865)
- Heubach Colorants India Ltd (506390)
- Quest Flow Controls Ltd (543982) - SME scrip
- RMC Switchgears Ltd (540358) - SME scrip
- Shekhawati Industries Ltd (533301)

**Stage Changes:**
- Logiciel Solutions Ltd (544625) - moving to higher stage
- Western Overseas Study Abroad Ltd (544636) - moving to lower stage

## Compliance Requirements

Securities under ST-ASM framework are subject to:
- Additional price bands and trading restrictions
- Enhanced margin requirements
- 100% upfront margin collection from buyers
- Possible Trade-to-Trade (T2T) settlement
- Restrictions on derivative contracts where applicable

Market participants must ensure compliance with the revised surveillance measures for affected securities.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** January 27, 2026 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Reduced liquidity for securities newly added to ST-ASM framework
- Trading restrictions may limit speculative activity
- Increased margin requirements may reduce trading volumes

**Investor Impact:**
- Investors in affected securities must provide 100% upfront margins
- Reduced intraday trading opportunities
- Potential impact on stock prices due to reduced participation

**Securities Exiting ST-ASM:**
10 securities are moving out, with most transitioning to other surveillance frameworks:
- 5 securities moving to Trade for Trade framework (stricter restrictions)
- 1 security (Jauss Polymers Ltd) moving to ESM framework
- These transitions indicate continued surveillance concerns requiring alternative monitoring mechanisms

The circular reflects BSE's ongoing efforts to maintain market integrity by monitoring securities with unusual price movements or volatility patterns.
