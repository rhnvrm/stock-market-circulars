The dilutive impact on existing shareholders is minimal for large-cap companies (ICICI Bank, Wipro, Bajaj Finserv) given their large outstanding share bases. For smaller companies like IZMO and Awfis, the relative dilution may be marginally more noticeable. Since no lock-in applies, allottees can sell immediately from February 24, 2026.
