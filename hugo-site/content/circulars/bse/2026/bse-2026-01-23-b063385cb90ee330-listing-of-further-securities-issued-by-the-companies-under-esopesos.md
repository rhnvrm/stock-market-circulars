## Summary

BSE has announced the listing and admission for trading of additional securities issued by six companies under their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). These shares will be available for trading from Tuesday, January 27, 2026. The total number of shares being listed is 23,965,537 across all six companies, with no lock-in period applicable.

## Key Points

- **AXIS Bank Limited**: 59,522 shares of face value ₹2
- **Genesys International Corporation Limited**: 20,165 shares of face value ₹5
- **HDFC Bank Limited**: 2,288,142 shares of face value ₹1 (largest quantity)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

Market participants should:
- Update their systems to reflect the increased share capital for these companies
- Note the distinctive numbers allocated to the new shares
- Recognize these securities as freely tradable from the effective date
- Contact BSE at 022-2272 5271/5878 for any clarifications

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 23, 2026
- **Listing Effective Date**: January 27, 2026 (Tuesday)
- **Lock-in Period**: Not applicable (NA) for all securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The additional shares represent routine ESOP exercises and are typically a small percentage of the total outstanding shares for established companies like HDFC Bank and Axis Bank. Urban Company's larger issuance (16.07 million shares) may warrant attention depending on its existing float.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible impact on overall liquidity given the small quantities relative to daily trading volumes for major banks. No lock-in period allows immediate trading.

**Dilution Impact**: Minor dilution to existing shareholders as these are incremental issuances under pre-approved ESOP schemes that investors are already aware of.
