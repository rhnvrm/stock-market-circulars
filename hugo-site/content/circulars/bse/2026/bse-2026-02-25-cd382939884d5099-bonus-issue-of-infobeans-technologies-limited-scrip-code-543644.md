## Impact Assessment

The listing of 7,27,19,580 bonus shares will increase the total share count of InfoBeans Technologies Limited, which may lead to a proportional adjustment in the share price on the effective listing date (March 4, 2026). Existing shareholders will receive additional shares without any cash outflow. The bonus issue is a positive signal of the company's retained earnings strength but typically results in price dilution proportional to the bonus ratio. Traders and investors holding positions in INFOBEANS (543644) should account for this corporate action in their portfolios.
