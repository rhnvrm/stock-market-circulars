## Impact Assessment

This mock trading session has minimal market impact as it occurs on a non-trading day (Saturday) and involves only the testing of disaster recovery infrastructure. The session allows trading members to verify their connectivity to BSE's DR site and ensure business continuity preparedness. No actual trades are executed, and participation is voluntary. The circular primarily serves operational and technical purposes to maintain system resilience.
