## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants and brokers must apply revised ST-ASM margin and trading restrictions for all newly added securities from February 24, 2026
- Securities moving out of ST-ASM and into LT-ASM or ESM will be subject to the respective framework's trading conditions
- For SME scrips (marked @), ST-ASM conditions apply specifically within the SME segment
- Scrips marked as per NSE (*) — applicability confirmed jointly with NSE

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** February 24, 2026 — all changes to ST-ASM framework applicability come into force
- **Circular Date:** February 23, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The addition of **Novartis India Ltd** (a large-cap, widely tracked pharmaceutical company) is the most market-significant inclusion in this update, likely to attract retail and institutional investor attention. The remaining additions are predominantly small/micro-cap and SME securities.

For the 4 securities transitioning to **LT-ASM** (Sayaji Industries, Kretto Syscon, Universal Office Automation, Thakral Services India), trading restrictions will be more prolonged and stringent than ST-ASM. The 2 securities moving to **ESM** (Deccan Polypacks, BLB Ltd) face the most severe surveillance-related trading constraints.

**Avanti Feeds Ltd** — a well-known aquaculture company — moving to a lower ASM stage is a mildly positive signal, indicating reduced surveillance concern. Overall market impact is moderate, primarily affecting traders in small/mid-cap and SME segments.
