## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - The listing involves a relatively small number of shares (71,944) issued through warrant conversion. This represents routine capital raising activity with minimal dilution impact.

**Investor Impact**: Low - Existing shareholders experience negligible dilution. Non-promoter investors who converted warrants now have tradeable shares subject to lock-in restrictions.

**Trading Impact**: Minimal - The lock-in period until August 5, 2026 means these shares will not be available for trading in the near term, limiting immediate market supply impact.
