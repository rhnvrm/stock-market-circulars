title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update on the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective January 07, 2026. The circular identifies four new securities being shortlisted under LT-ASM, two securities moving to higher ASM stages, three securities exiting the framework, and provides a consolidated list of all securities currently under various ASM stages.

## Key Points

- 4 new securities shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Lokesh Machines Ltd, Precision Electronics Ltd, S&S Power Switchgear Ltd, and United Van Der Horst Ltd
- 2 securities moving to higher ASM Stage II: Fabino Enterprises Ltd and Soma Papers & Industries Ltd
- 3 securities moving out of LT-ASM Framework: Aerpace Industries Ltd (to ESM), Karnavati Finance Ltd (to GSM), and Kinetic Trust Ltd (to ESM)
- No securities moving to lower ASM stages or directly to Stage IV
- Changes effective from January 07, 2026
- Consolidated list includes securities across ASM Stages I, II, and IV

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework continues to operate as a surveillance mechanism for securities exhibiting certain risk characteristics. Securities are classified into different stages (I, II, IV) based on their risk profile and surveillance requirements. The framework includes provisions for:

- Shortlisting new securities based on predefined criteria
- Progressive movement to higher stages for continued non-compliance or risk factors
- Movement to lower stages for improved compliance
- Exit from LT-ASM when securities are included in other frameworks (Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, IBC)

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the enhanced surveillance applicable to securities listed in Annexure I (new entries)
- Trading members should be aware of the stage changes for securities in Annexure I Part B (moving to Stage II)
- Securities moving out of LT-ASM (Annexure II) will be subject to other frameworks: ESM Framework for Aerpace Industries Ltd and Kinetic Trust Ltd, GSM Framework for Karnavati Finance Ltd
- All securities under LT-ASM are subject to specific trading restrictions and surveillance measures as per their assigned stage

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 07, 2026 - All changes to LT-ASM framework come into effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The inclusion of new securities and stage changes affects trading conditions for these specific stocks. Securities under LT-ASM typically face additional restrictions such as reduced price bands, increased margin requirements, or trade-for-trade settlement.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading in the affected securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance measures which may include higher margins, settlement restrictions, and increased monitoring.

**Operational Impact**: The movement of three securities out of LT-ASM into other frameworks (ESM and GSM) indicates either deteriorating conditions requiring stricter oversight or specific regulatory actions. Fabino Enterprises Ltd and Soma Papers & Industries Ltd moving to Stage II ASM indicates escalating surveillance due to continued concerns.
