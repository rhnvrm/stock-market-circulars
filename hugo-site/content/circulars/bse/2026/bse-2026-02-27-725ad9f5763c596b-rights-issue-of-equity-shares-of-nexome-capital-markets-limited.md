## Impact Assessment

This rights issue will dilute existing shareholding by up to 50% (1 new share per 2 held) if fully subscribed. The issue price of Rs. 75/- (face value Rs. 10/- + Rs. 65/- premium) reflects a premium over face value. Existing shareholders have the right to subscribe to maintain their proportional holding. Trading members must apply ex-rights adjustments from the record date, which may affect intraday pricing and margin calculations for this scrip. Impact is limited to holders and traders of this specific company's shares.
