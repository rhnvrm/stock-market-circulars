title: Changes in Price Band for 32 Securities Effective February 09, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 32 securities effective February 09, 2026. The price bands range from 2% to 20%, with most securities receiving 5% or 10% bands. These changes are implemented as surveillance measures to control volatility and protect investors in these scrips.

## Key Points

- 32 securities will have revised price bands effective February 09, 2026
- Price band revisions range from 2% (tightest) to 20% (widest)
- Majority of securities (17) receive 5% price band
- 9 securities receive 10% price band
- 3 securities receive 20% price band (Dr Lalchandani Labs, GTN Textiles, Prozone Realty)
- 1 security receives 2% price band (Gretex Corporate Services)
- Changes apply to the Equity segment
- Notice issued by BSE Surveillance department

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements surveillance measures through price band adjustments. Price bands limit the maximum price movement (up or down) a security can experience in a single trading day. Tighter bands (2-5%) indicate higher surveillance concern, while wider bands (20%) allow more price movement.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands from February 09, 2026
- All trades in these 32 securities must comply with new price band limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Risk management systems must be updated to reflect new price band restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 6, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 09, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements in these securities, potentially reducing volatility but also limiting liquidity. Securities with tighter bands (2-5%) may experience reduced trading volumes.

**Trading Impact:** Traders and investors in these 32 securities will face stricter price movement limits. Circuit breakers will trigger more frequently, potentially causing trading halts during volatile sessions.

**Investor Protection:** Tighter price bands serve as protective measures against excessive speculation and price manipulation, particularly for securities showing unusual price movements or low liquidity.

**Surveillance Context:** The varied price band levels (2% to 20%) suggest differentiated surveillance concerns across securities, with Gretex Corporate Services under tightest monitoring (2%) and three companies allowed wider movement (20%).
