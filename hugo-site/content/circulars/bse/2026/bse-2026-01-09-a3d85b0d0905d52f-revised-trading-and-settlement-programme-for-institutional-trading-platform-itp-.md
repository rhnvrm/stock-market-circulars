---

## Summary

BSE has issued a revised trading and settlement programme for the Institutional Trading Platform (ITP) SME Segment for the period January 1-30, 2026. The circular outlines 21 settlement cycles (ITP-189/25-26 through ITP-209/25-26) with T+1 settlement for most days. Special arrangements are in place for January 16, 2026, where two settlements will occur on the same day due to a settlement holiday on January 15, 2026, with different pay-in and pay-out timings.

## Key Points

- Settlement cycle runs from ITP-189/25-26 (trade date: January 1) to ITP-209/25-26 (trade date: January 30)
- Standard T+1 settlement cycle applies for most trading days
- Standard pay-in time: 10:00 AM (members must submit instructions by 9:50 AM)
- Standard pay-out time: 11:00 AM
- January 16, 2026 will have two settlements due to settlement holiday on January 15
- Special settlement timings on January 16: First settlement at 10:00 AM/12:30 PM, second at 4:30 PM/9:30 PM
- January 26 is a trading holiday (Republic Day)
- Notice issued by Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd.

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine operational circular providing revised settlement schedules to accommodate the settlement holiday on January 15, 2026.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must submit pay-in instructions to depositories/banks by 9:50 AM for standard settlements
- For ITP-198/25-26 (January 14 trade, January 16 settlement): Submit instructions by 9:50 AM
- For ITP-199/25-26 (January 15 trade, January 16 settlement): Submit instructions by 4:20 PM
- Members must ensure funds and securities are available according to the revised schedule
- Adherence to modified timings on January 16, 2026 is mandatory

## Important Dates

- **January 1-30, 2026**: Revised settlement programme period
- **January 15, 2026**: Settlement holiday
- **January 16, 2026**: Special settlement day with two separate settlement cycles
  - Settlement 1 (ITP-198): Pay-in 10:00 AM, Pay-out 12:30 PM
  - Settlement 2 (ITP-199): Pay-in 4:30 PM, Pay-out 9:30 PM
- **January 26, 2026**: Trading holiday (Republic Day - implied from schedule gap)
- **January 31, 2026**: Pay-out for January 30 trading (February 2, 2026)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium. Members trading on the ITP-SME platform must adjust their operational processes to accommodate the dual settlement cycle on January 16, 2026. The modified timings require careful planning for fund and security management.

**Market Impact**: Low to Medium. The revised schedule ensures continuity of trading operations while accommodating the settlement holiday. The T+1 settlement cycle is maintained throughout, minimizing disruption to institutional participants.

**Risk Considerations**: Members must ensure adequate liquidity and operational readiness for the afternoon settlement cycle on January 16, particularly the 4:30 PM pay-in and 9:30 PM pay-out, which deviate from standard market hours. Failure to meet these timings could result in settlement failures and penalties.
