## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - SLB participants holding positions in these 9 securities will need to plan for foreclosure during shut periods. The staggered dates across February 2026 distribute the impact.

**Trading Impact**: SLB liquidity for these securities will be temporarily affected during their respective shut periods, potentially impacting short-selling strategies and securities lending revenue.

**Operational Impact**: Market participants must track multiple shut periods across different dates and ensure timely position settlement to avoid forced foreclosure penalties.
