## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational notice under existing BSE settlement and auction procedures for handling non-delivery of securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members who have failed to deliver securities in Settlement No. 828 will have their positions settled through the auction mechanism
- Buyers of auctioned securities will receive shares through this process
- Members should ensure timely participation in the auction as per BSE procedures

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

Low market impact. This is a standard demat auction process conducted by BSE to resolve non-delivery of shares in the settlement cycle. While a broad range of securities across sectors is listed, the quantities involved are relatively small for most scrips. Members involved in the non-delivery will face auction settlement prices which may differ from market prices. No systemic or broad market implications.
