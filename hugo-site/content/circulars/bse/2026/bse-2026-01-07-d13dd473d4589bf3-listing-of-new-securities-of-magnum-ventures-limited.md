## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a preferential allotment to promoters representing additional equity capital for the company. The lock-in period until July 29, 2026 means these shares cannot be traded freely for approximately 7 months, limiting immediate supply increase. The shares being issued at premium (Rs. 30 vs face value Rs. 10) indicates positive valuation. Total impact on trading members is informational only, requiring awareness of the expanded share capital and lock-in restrictions.
