## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Addition of a new stock to BSE with immediate trading availability for 1,342,400 public issue shares (19.1% of total). The remaining shares will gradually become available for trading as lock-in periods expire.

**Liquidity**: Initial liquidity will be limited to the free float of approximately 19% until anchor lock-ins expire in February-April 2026, after which approximately 26.5% will be freely tradable.

**Investor Impact**: Public investors have immediate trading access while promoters demonstrate commitment through structured lock-in periods, providing stability. Gradual unlocking of shares over 3 years prevents sudden supply shocks to the market.
