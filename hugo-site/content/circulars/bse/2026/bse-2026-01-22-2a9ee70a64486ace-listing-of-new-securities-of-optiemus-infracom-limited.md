## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification with minimal market impact. The relatively small number of shares (167,000) represents a minor addition to the existing share capital. The lock-in period until August 5, 2026, prevents immediate selling pressure. The preferential allotment to non-promoters through warrant conversion is a standard capital raising mechanism.
