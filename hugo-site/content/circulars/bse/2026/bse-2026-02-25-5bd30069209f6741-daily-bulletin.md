## Impact Assessment

This is a routine daily bulletin with moderate market significance. The equity-related actions — an interim dividend by Eighty Jewellers (Rs. 0.10/share, 1%) and a forthcoming rights issue by Enbee Trade & Finance — are directly relevant to retail and institutional equity investors in those scrips. The numerous HUDCO NCD interest and redemption events are relevant to debt market participants holding those instruments. Commercial paper redemptions by Bajaj Housing Finance and Capri Global Capital are relevant to money-market investors. No systemic or broad-market disruption is expected.
