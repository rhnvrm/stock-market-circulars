Two securities have been newly shortlisted: Hindustan Copper Ltd and Quest Flow Controls Ltd. No securities are being moved to higher or lower ASM stages, moved directly to Stage IV, or exiting the LT-ASM framework. The circular also provides a consolidated list of all securities currently under various ASM stages.

## Key Points

- 2 securities newly added to LT-ASM framework: Hindustan Copper Ltd (Scrip Code: 513599, ISIN: INE531E01026) and Quest Flow Controls Ltd (Scrip Code: 543982, ISIN: INE0OYE01013)

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework continues to apply enhanced surveillance measures to securities that meet specific criteria related to price movements, volatility, or other market concerns. Securities under LT-ASM are subject to additional monitoring and trading restrictions designed to protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

Market participants must:
- Be aware of securities newly added to LT-ASM framework
- Comply with any additional margin requirements and trading restrictions applicable to LT-ASM securities
- Monitor the consolidated ASM list for positions in affected securities
- Ensure clients are informed about surveillance measures on these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 30, 2026 - New LT-ASM classifications become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Two securities newly subject to long-term surveillance measures, which may affect liquidity and trading activity in these scrips. The LT-ASM framework typically involves stricter margin requirements and position limits.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading Hindustan Copper Ltd and Quest Flow Controls Ltd will face enhanced surveillance conditions, potentially including higher margins and delivery-based settlement requirements.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and risk management frameworks to account for the LT-ASM status of the newly added securities.
