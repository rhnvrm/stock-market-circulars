title: Suspension of Trading in Debentures of AYE FINANCE LIMITED
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a notice suspending trading in Non-Convertible Debentures of AYE FINANCE LIMITED (ISIN: INE501X07612, Code: 975852) effective January 9, 2026. The suspension is implemented due to the company fixing a record date of January 10, 2026 for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are instructed not to deal in these debentures from the specified date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies to AYE FINANCE LIMITED debentures with 10.60% coupon rate maturing in 2026
- ISIN: INE501X07612
- BSE Code: 975852
- No dealings permitted from January 9, 2026 onwards
- Record date set for January 10, 2026
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Notice reference: DR-795/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action procedure requiring temporary trading suspension to facilitate accurate determination of eligible debenture holders for redemption and interest payment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from January 9, 2026
- Trading members must ensure compliance with the no-dealings instruction
- Members should inform their clients holding these debentures about the trading suspension
- Record date compliance for determining eligible holders for redemption and interest payment

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** January 1, 2026
- **Trading Suspension Date:** January 9, 2026 (no dealings from this date)
- **Record Date:** January 10, 2026 (for redemption and interest payment eligibility)

## Impact Assessment

**Debenture Holders:** High impact - investors holding these debentures cannot exit positions through market trading from January 9, 2026. However, this is a planned suspension ahead of redemption and interest payment, so holders will receive their principal and interest as per the debenture terms.

**Market Liquidity:** Trading suspension eliminates secondary market liquidity for these specific debentures during the suspension period.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their systems and inform clients about the trading restrictions to prevent failed transactions and compliance issues.
