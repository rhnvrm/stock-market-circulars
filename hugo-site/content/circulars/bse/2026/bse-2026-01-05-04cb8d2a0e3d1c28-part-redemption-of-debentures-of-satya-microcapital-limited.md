## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it pertains to a specific series of privately placed non-convertible debentures. The part redemption reduces the face value from the original amount to Rs. 80,000 per debenture. Only holders of these specific debentures are affected. Trading members dealing in this security need to adjust their systems to reflect the reduced face value from the effective date.
