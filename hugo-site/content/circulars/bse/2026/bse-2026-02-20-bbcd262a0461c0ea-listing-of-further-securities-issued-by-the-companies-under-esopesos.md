## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced by this circular. This is a standard procedural notification confirming the admission of ESOP/ESOS-allotted shares to trading on BSE.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance actions are required from market participants. The notice is informational, advising all market participants to take note of the newly listed securities and their respective distribution numbers.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 20, 2026
- **Effective Trading Date:** Monday, February 23, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry:** Not applicable (no lock-in for any listed shares)

## Impact Assessment

The impact is routine and low. These are standard ESOP/ESOS listings that represent employee compensation conversions into tradeable equity. The largest addition is Lloyds Engineering Works Limited with 5,880,060 new shares (face value ₹1), which could have a minor dilutive effect. All other companies see modest additions. Since no lock-in applies, shares are immediately tradeable from February 23, 2026, but volumes are unlikely to be market-moving given the small quantities relative to typical float sizes.
