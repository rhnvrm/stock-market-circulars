title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities Update effective February
  27, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective **February 27, 2026**. One security — Sadbhav Engineering Ltd (Scrip Code: 532710) — has been newly shortlisted under the ESM framework. Transglobe Foods Ltd (Scrip Code: 519367) is being moved to a higher ESM stage. No securities are being moved to a lower ESM stage, and no securities are exiting the ESM framework in this update. A consolidated list of all securities currently under ESM is also provided (Annexure III).

## Key Points

- **Newly added to ESM (Part A, Annexure I):** Sadbhav Engineering Ltd | Scrip Code: 532710 | ISIN: INE226H01026
- **Moved to higher ESM stage:** Transglobe Foods Ltd | Scrip Code: 519367 | ISIN: INE213P01027
- **Moved to lower ESM stage:** Nil
- **Moving out of ESM framework:** Nil
- All changes are effective from **February 27, 2026**
- The consolidated list (Annexure III) includes numerous securities across ESM Stage I and Stage II
- Securities marked `*` are as per NSE; securities marked `#` are SME scrips
- Per circulars 20251127-51 and 20260105-26, certain securities will continue in Trade for Trade settlement even after ESM changes

## Regulatory Changes

- Sadbhav Engineering Ltd is placed under the ESM framework for the first time under this update, subjecting it to ESM-related trading restrictions.
- Transglobe Foods Ltd is escalated to a higher ESM stage, implying stricter surveillance and potentially more restrictive trading conditions.
- No downgrade or removal of any security from ESM was effected in this cycle.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading members and brokers** must ensure compliance with ESM trading restrictions for all newly added and stage-upgraded securities effective February 27, 2026.
- **Investors** holding or intending to trade in ESM-listed securities should note that these securities are subject to trade-for-trade settlement, reduced price bands, and periodic review.
- **Clearing members** must apply appropriate margin and settlement procedures for ESM securities.
- Members should refer to the consolidated list (Annexure III) for the complete and current ESM universe.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** February 27, 2026 — all additions, stage upgrades, and the updated consolidated list come into force.
- **Reference Circulars:** 20251127-51 (November 27, 2025) and 20260105-26 (January 5, 2026) for Trade for Trade continuation rules.

## Impact Assessment

- **Sadbhav Engineering Ltd (532710):** Inclusion in ESM will impose trade-for-trade settlement and stricter price bands, significantly reducing liquidity and increasing transaction costs for investors. This is a notable addition given the company's profile in the infrastructure sector.
- **Transglobe Foods Ltd (519367):** Escalation to a higher ESM stage signals continued regulatory concern over the scrip's trading patterns, with even more restrictive conditions now applying.
- **Market-wide:** The absence of any securities exiting the ESM framework this cycle indicates no improvement in surveillance status for currently listed ESM securities, maintaining elevated restrictions across the ESM universe.
- Retail and institutional investors with positions in ESM securities should reassess liquidity risk given the trade-for-trade mechanism and applicable price band restrictions.
