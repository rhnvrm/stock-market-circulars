## Summary

BSE has issued this notice in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20260224-38 dated February 24, 2026. Annvrridhhi Ventures Ltd (Scrip Code: 890229) has cancelled the record date of February 27, 2026, which was set to determine holders of Partly Paid Rights Equity Shares (PPS) eligible to receive the First Call Notice. The Rights Committee of the company, at its meeting held on February 26, 2026, resolved to rescind the earlier resolution dated February 23, 2026, which had approved the First Call of Rs. 2.50 per partly paid-up equity share (face value Rs. 10/- each). As a result, trading in the Partly Paid Shares (Scrip Code: 890229) will resume with effect from March 2, 2026.

## Key Points

- The record date of February 27, 2026, fixed for determining PPS holders for the First Call has been cancelled and withdrawn.
- The Rights Committee of Annvrridhhi Ventures Ltd rescinded its resolution dated February 23, 2026, approving a First Call of Rs. 2.50 per partly paid-up equity share (face value Rs. 10/-).
- The cancellation was made pursuant to an internal review of the call schedule.
- Although an advertisement regarding the earlier record date was published in newspapers on February 24, 2026, the Call Notice had not been dispatched and no call money had become due or payable.
- Trading in Partly Paid Shares (Scrip Code: 890229) will resume from March 2, 2026 (DR-831/2025-2026).

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This notice reflects a company-level withdrawal of a corporate action (First Call on PPS) communicated through BSE's listing compliance framework. The cancellation is consistent with exchange procedures for rectifying or rescinding corporate action notices before execution.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are required to take note of the resumption of trading in Partly Paid Shares of Annvrridhhi Ventures Ltd (Scrip Code: 890229) effective March 2, 2026.
- No call money obligations have arisen for PPS holders as the Call Notice was never dispatched and no amounts became due or payable.
- Members should disregard the newspaper advertisement dated February 24, 2026, relating to the now-cancelled record date.

## Important Dates

- **February 23, 2026**: Original resolution passed by Rights Committee approving the First Call.
- **February 24, 2026**: Newspaper advertisement published for the record date (now cancelled).
- **February 26, 2026**: Rights Committee meeting at which the earlier resolution was rescinded.
- **February 27, 2026**: Original record date (now cancelled); date of this BSE notice.
- **March 2, 2026**: Resumption of trading in Partly Paid Shares (Scrip Code: 890229).

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of Partly Paid Shares of Annvrridhhi Ventures Ltd. The cancellation of the First Call means PPS holders are not required to pay Rs. 2.50 per share at this time, providing short-term relief from immediate financial obligation. The resumption of trading from March 2, 2026 restores market liquidity in the PPS, allowing holders to transact in the scrip. Broader market impact is minimal given the company-specific and relatively small-scale nature of this action.
