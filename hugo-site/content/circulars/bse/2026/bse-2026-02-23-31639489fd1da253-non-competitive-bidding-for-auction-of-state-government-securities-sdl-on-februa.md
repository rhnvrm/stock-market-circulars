This circular is relevant primarily to trading members and institutional participants active in the government securities debt market. The SDL auction covers 34 securities from 16 states/UTs with significant aggregate issuance. Notable large issuers include Karnataka (Rs. 8,000 crore across 5 securities), Rajasthan (Rs. 4,000 crore across 2 securities), Punjab (Rs. 2,000 crore), and West Bengal (Rs. 3,000 crore including re-issue). The non-competitive bidding route provides retail and smaller participants access to these securities at the weighted average cut-off price without price discovery risk. No impact on equity markets is expected.
