## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of 16 securities from the rolling segment to the trade-for-trade (T2T) segment with a price band of 5% or lower, effective February 5, 2026. Additionally, 31 securities will be retained in the T2T segment. In T2T segment, securities can only be traded for delivery purposes with no intraday trading allowed, and the price band is restricted to 5% or lower. No securities from the SME platform are being shifted to or retained in T2T segment at this time.

- 31 securities to be retained in T2T segment across various groups (XT, T, Z, P)
- No SME securities affected in this circular
- T2T trading means compulsory delivery settlement with no intraday squaring off

## Securities Retained in T2T (Annexure-II)

- **XT Group**: 16 securities
- **T Group**: 7 securities
- **Z Group**: 6 securities
- **P Group**: 1 security (Softbpo Global Services Ltd)

## Regulatory Changes

This action represents an enhanced surveillance measure by BSE. Securities moved to T2T segment are subject to:
- Compulsory delivery-based settlement
- No intraday trading permitted
- Price band restricted to 5% or lower (reduced from standard 10% or 20%)
- Higher margin requirements
- Increased scrutiny on trading activity

## Compliance Requirements

- **Investors**: Must take delivery of all purchases; cannot square off positions intraday
- **Brokers**: Must ensure clients are aware of T2T restrictions and delivery obligations
- **Trading Members**: Need to update systems to reflect the group changes
- All existing open positions in these securities must be settled before the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: February 2, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 5, 2026 (from start of trading)
- All changes apply from the opening of trading session on February 5, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact** - The shift to T2T segment with 5% price band significantly impacts:

- **Liquidity**: Severely reduced as intraday trading is eliminated
- **Trading Volume**: Expected to drop substantially due to delivery-only requirement
- **Investor Base**: Retail traders and day traders will likely exit these securities
- **Price Discovery**: May be impaired due to lower participation
- **Margin Requirements**: Increased, making these securities more capital-intensive to trade
- **Risk Profile**: The 5% price band limits both upside and downside movement, reducing volatility

Investors holding these securities should be aware that liquidity will be significantly constrained, and they may face difficulty in entering or exiting positions. This measure is typically applied to securities that have exhibited unusual price movements, have corporate governance concerns, or have low trading volumes.
