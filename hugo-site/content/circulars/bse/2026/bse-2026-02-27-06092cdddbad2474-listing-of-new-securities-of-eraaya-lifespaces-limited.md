## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 41,60,000 shares to Eraaya Lifespaces Limited's equity base, representing promoter-held shares subject to a lock-in until September 2027. Since these shares cannot be traded in the open market until the lock-in expires, the immediate liquidity and price impact is limited. However, existing shareholders face dilution from this preferential allotment. The warrant conversion at Rs. 81/- per share reflects the agreed preferential pricing. Market participants should monitor the lock-in expiry date (September 10, 2027) as a potential future liquidity event.
