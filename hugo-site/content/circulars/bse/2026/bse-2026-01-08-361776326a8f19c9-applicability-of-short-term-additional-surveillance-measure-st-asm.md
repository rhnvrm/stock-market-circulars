- Enhanced surveillance
- Additional reporting requirements
- Potential trading restrictions
- Stage-wise escalation based on continued price/volume anomalies

- (*) = As per NSE or moving to LT-ASM
- ($) = Moving to ESM Framework
- (@) = SME Scrips
- (~) = T+0 Scrips
- (#) = Moving to GSM Framework
- (^) = Moving to Pledge Framework
- (**) = Moving to Trade for Trade Framework

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 09, 2026
- **Circular Date**: January 08, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities added to ST-ASM Stage I will face enhanced surveillance and potential liquidity constraints. Traders should expect:
- Increased monitoring of price movements
- Possible additional margin requirements
- Heightened scrutiny of trading patterns

**Migration Impact**: 11 securities exiting ST-ASM are moving to other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM) or being removed, indicating either escalation to stricter measures or improvement in trading behavior.

**Market Participants**: Investors holding positions in affected securities should review their portfolios and understand the implications of surveillance measures on liquidity and trading conditions.
