---

## Summary

BSE has published the Demat Auction list for Settlement No. 827 dated 25 February 2026. This auction covers securities where delivery obligations were not met by sellers, requiring BSE to conduct a compulsory auction to fulfill buyer delivery obligations. The list includes 60+ scrips spanning large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies across multiple sectors.

## Key Points

- Settlement Number: 827, dated 25/02/2026
- Over 60 securities listed for demat auction due to delivery shortages
- Quantities range from 1 share (e.g., A2Z Infra, Adani Ports) to 164,800 shares (ITC Ltd.)
- Major blue-chip stocks included: Reliance Industries (10,030 shares), Infosys (2,400), ITC (164,800), State Bank of India (2,250), Tata Consultancy Services (1,400)
- Significant quantities also noted for Indian Renewable Energy (62,100), PADAM COTTON (6,911), OIL AND NATURAL GAS (4,500), ASHAPURA MINERALS (8,500)
- Auction covers equities across banking, IT, pharma, energy, FMCG, and infrastructure sectors

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational notice under existing BSE settlement and auction procedures for handling delivery defaults in the equity segment.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Sellers/Brokers with delivery defaults**: Must be aware that their undelivered securities are being auctioned; resulting auction purchase cost plus applicable penalties will be debited.
- **Buyers**: Will receive their securities through the auction mechanism; no action required.
- **Participating Auction Brokers**: May bid for the auctioned securities during the designated auction session on the exchange platform.
- Settlement of auction proceeds will follow standard BSE auction settlement timelines.

## Important Dates

- **Auction Date**: 25 February 2026
- **Settlement Number**: 827
- Auction participants must submit bids within the BSE-designated auction window on 25/02/2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact: Medium**

The demat auction involves a large number of scrips (60+) with significant quantities in some cases:
- **ITC Ltd.** (164,800 shares) and **Indian Renewable Energy** (62,100 shares) represent the largest auction quantities and may see minor price pressure.
- **PADAM COTTON** (6,911 shares), **OIL AND NATURAL GAS** (4,500 shares), and **ASHAPURA MINERALS** (8,500 shares) also carry notable quantities.
- Blue-chip stocks like Reliance (10,030), Infosys (2,400), SBI (2,250), and Tata Consultancy (1,400) have moderate quantities unlikely to cause significant price impact given their high liquidity.
- For small/mid-cap scrips with low liquidity (e.g., SAWACA ENTERPRISES at 50,000 shares, SYSCHEM at 478 shares), auction activity could have a more pronounced short-term price effect.
- This is a routine operational settlement process; no systemic market risk implied.
