## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction involves 98 securities, indicating delivery failures across multiple scrips. While this is a routine market operation, the breadth of securities affected suggests settlement issues across various market segments.

**Operational Impact:** Members with short positions in these securities face mandatory auction participation, which may result in higher costs compared to normal delivery. The presence of high-value stocks and large quantities (particularly Excel Realty with 49,900 shares) could lead to significant financial implications for affected members.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - For investors holding long positions expecting delivery, the auction mechanism ensures they receive their securities, though timing may be affected. Price discovery in the auction may differ from regular market prices.
