## Summary

BSE has announced a trading restriction on partly paid equity shares of LLOYDS ENTERPRISES LIMITED (Scrip Code 890224) effective January 16, 2026. The company has fixed a record date to determine shareholders eligible to receive call notices for payment of the first and final call amount of Rs. 19.50 per partly paid share (Rs. 0.50 towards face value and Rs. 19.00 as premium). Trading members are prohibited from dealing in these partly paid shares from the record date.

## Key Points

- Trading in partly paid equity shares of LLOYDS ENTERPRISES LIMITED (Scrip Code 890224) to be suspended from January 16, 2026
- Record date fixed as January 16, 2026 for call notice distribution
- Call amount: Rs. 19.50 per partly paid share (Rs. 0.50 face value + Rs. 19.00 premium)
- Settlement number: DR-800/2025-2026
- Purpose: First and final call payment on partly paid equity shares
- Only partly paid equity shares affected; fully paid shares unaffected

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action procedure for companies with partly paid equity shares where the company is calling for remaining unpaid capital from shareholders.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must cease all dealings in partly paid equity shares (Scrip Code 890224) of LLOYDS ENTERPRISES LIMITED from January 16, 2026
- **Trading Members**: Required to take note of the suspension and ensure compliance
- **Shareholders**: Holders of partly paid equity shares as of record date will receive call notice for payment of Rs. 19.50 per share
- **Shareholders**: Must respond to call notice for payment of first and final call amount when received

## Important Dates

- **January 9, 2026**: Circular issue date
- **January 16, 2026**: Record date for determining eligible partly paid shareholders
- **January 16, 2026**: No dealings commencement date for partly paid equity shares
- **Settlement DR-800/2025-2026**: Applicable settlement cycle

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of partly paid equity shares of LLOYDS ENTERPRISES LIMITED. Fully paid equity shares remain unaffected and continue normal trading.

**Shareholder Impact**: High impact on partly paid shareholders who must arrange funds (Rs. 19.50 per share) to respond to the call notice. Failure to pay may result in forfeiture of shares as per company's articles of association.

**Trading Impact**: Complete trading suspension for partly paid shares (Scrip Code 890224) eliminates liquidity for these instruments from January 16, 2026. Investors holding these shares cannot exit positions through market trading.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trading in the specific scrip code and inform clients holding partly paid shares about the call payment obligation.
