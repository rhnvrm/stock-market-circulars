## Impact Assessment

This circular has a **medium, targeted impact** limited to holders of Padam Cotton Yarns Limited shares who have been allotted Rights Entitlements. Trading members dealing in this scrip must act quickly given the narrow 3-day renunciation window (March 2–4). Clients who fail to either subscribe to the Rights Issue or renounce their REs before March 9, 2026 will lose their entitlements entirely. The trade-for-trade settlement mechanism reduces speculative activity and ensures direct delivery obligations for each transaction.
