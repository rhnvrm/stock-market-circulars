## Summary

BSE has announced updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Framework effective February 03, 2026. Four securities have been newly shortlisted under the ST-ASM framework, while six securities are moving out of the framework. The circular provides a consolidated list of all securities currently under Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM surveillance stages.

## Key Points

- 4 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework: Ceeta Industries Ltd, MTAR Technologies Ltd, Standard Batteries Ltd, and Sterlite Technologies Ltd
- 6 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework: Baazar Style Retail Ltd, Sudarshan Colorants India Ltd, Riddhi Display Equipments Ltd, RMC Switchgears Ltd, Shekhawati Industries Ltd, and Western Overseas Study Abroad Ltd
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages within the framework
- Consolidated list includes 16+ securities under various ST-ASM Stage I and Stage II classifications
- Changes effective from February 03, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term ASM Framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities based on predefined criteria. Securities can move into ST-ASM, transition between stages, or exit the framework based on movements to other surveillance frameworks including LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge Framework, or ESM Framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the securities subject to ST-ASM surveillance measures
- Trading in these securities will be subject to additional surveillance requirements as per ST-ASM framework guidelines
- Special attention required for securities marked with @ (SME scrips), * (as per NSE), and ~ (T+0 scrips)

## Important Dates

- **February 03, 2026**: Effective date for all ST-ASM Framework changes including additions, removals, and consolidated list applicability

## Impact Assessment

The ST-ASM framework impacts liquidity and trading conditions for the affected securities. New additions face enhanced surveillance which may include price bands, position limits, or other trading restrictions. Securities exiting ST-ASM may transition to other surveillance frameworks or return to normal trading conditions. Market participants trading in these securities should adjust their strategies accordingly and monitor for any additional restrictions that may apply under the respective ASM stages.
