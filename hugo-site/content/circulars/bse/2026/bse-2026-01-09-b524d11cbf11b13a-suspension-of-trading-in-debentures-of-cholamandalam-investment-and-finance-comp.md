**Investor Impact:** Debenture holders as on the record date (January 16, 2026) will be eligible for interest payment and redemption proceeds. Those wishing to exit positions must do so before the no-dealings date.

**Operational Impact:** Standard corporate action with no unusual market disruption expected. Trading members need to update their systems to block trading in these specific ISINs from the specified date.
