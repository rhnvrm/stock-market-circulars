## Summary

BSE has informed that pursuant to an order issued by the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), the delisting of Nutraplus India Limited (Scrip Code: 524764) stands rescinded. The company's status will be changed from "Delisted" to "Suspended" with effect from January 28, 2026. As a result of this status change, the provisions of Regulation 34(1) and Regulation 34(2) of SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2021 are no longer applicable to the company.

## Key Points

- Securities Appellate Tribunal has rescinded the delisting of Nutraplus India Limited
- Scrip Code: 524764
- Status change: From "Delisted" to "Suspended"
- SEBI Delisting Regulations provisions (Regulation 34(1) and 34(2)) will not apply to the company
- Notice issued by BSE Listing Compliance Department

## Regulatory Changes

The delisting order previously applicable to Nutraplus India Limited has been rescinded by the Securities Appellate Tribunal. This reverses the delisting status and brings the company under suspended trading status. Consequently, the specific provisions of SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2021, particularly Regulation 34(1) and Regulation 34(2), are no longer applicable to this company.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance actions are required from market participants. This is an informational circular regarding the change in company status. The company will now be subject to regulations applicable to suspended securities rather than delisted securities.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 23, 2026
- **Effective Date of Status Change**: January 28, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Company Impact**: This is a significant development for Nutraplus India Limited as it reverses the delisting and places the company in suspended status, potentially allowing for future resumption of trading subject to meeting regulatory requirements.

**Market Impact**: Limited market-wide impact as this affects only one specific scrip. However, it demonstrates the appellate process for companies challenging delisting decisions.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders of Nutraplus India Limited may benefit from this development as suspended status (versus delisted status) keeps open the possibility of eventual trading resumption if the company meets compliance requirements.

**Regulatory Significance**: The tribunal's order highlights the role of Securities Appellate Tribunal in reviewing delisting decisions and provides precedent for companies seeking to challenge delisting orders.
