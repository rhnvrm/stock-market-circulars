## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to medium. This is a routine administrative action for commercial paper redemptions. The suspensions are temporary and expected as part of the normal debt instrument lifecycle.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members dealing in debt securities need to update their systems and inform clients holding these commercial papers about the upcoming redemptions. No trading activity will be permitted in these instruments from the specified dates.

**Investor Impact:** Holders of these commercial papers will receive redemption proceeds on their respective maturity dates. The suspension prevents any secondary market trading that could complicate the redemption process.
