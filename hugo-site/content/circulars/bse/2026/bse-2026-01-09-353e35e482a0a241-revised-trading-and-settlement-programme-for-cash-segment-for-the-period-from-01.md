  & T+0)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a revised trading and settlement programme for the Cash (Equity) segment covering the period from January 1, 2026 to January 31, 2026. The circular provides detailed settlement schedules for both T+1 and T+0 settlement cycles, including settlement numbers, trading dates, depository entry deadlines, pay-in/pay-out dates, and auction schedules. The revision accounts for a settlement holiday on January 15, 2026, which affects settlement timelines for trades executed on January 14 and 15.

## Key Points

- Revised settlement programme covers January 1-31, 2026 for both T+1 and T+0 cycles
- T+1 settlements: DR-789/25-26 through DR-809/25-26 (21 settlements)
- T+0 settlements: DR-484/25-26 through DR-504/25-26 (20 settlements, skipping DR-494)
- Settlement holiday on January 15, 2026 impacts pay-in/pay-out schedules
- Trades on January 14 and 15 will settle on January 16, 2026 (marked with @)
- Auction settlements follow regular trading settlements with designated RA numbers
- OTR allocation deadline: 8:00 PM on T day
- OTR confirmation deadline: 7:30 AM on T+1 day

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a routine operational schedule revision to accommodate the settlement holiday on January 15, 2026.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must enter 6A/7A data on the specified trading dates
- Custodians must confirm 6A/7A data by the deadlines indicated
- Members must submit auction offers on designated auction settlement numbers
- OTR (Off-The-Record) allocation entries must be completed by members by 8:00 PM on T day
- OTR confirmation (take-up entries) must be completed by custodians by 7:30 AM on T+1 day
- All participants must adhere to the revised pay-in/pay-out schedules

## Important Dates

- **January 1-31, 2026**: Revised settlement programme period
- **January 15, 2026**: Settlement holiday - no settlements processed
- **January 14, 2026**: Trading date for DR-798/25-26, settling January 16, 2026
- **January 15, 2026**: Trading date for DR-799/25-26, settling January 16, 2026
- **January 16, 2026**: Pay-in/pay-out for both January 14 and 15 trades
- **Weekends adjusted**: Settlements scheduled around Saturday-Sunday closures

## Impact Assessment

**Market-Wide Impact**: High - This circular affects all participants in the Cash/Equity segment at BSE, including brokers, custodians, clearing members, and depositories. The revised schedule ensures smooth operations throughout January 2026.

**Operational Impact**: The settlement holiday on January 15, 2026 requires careful planning as it consolidates two trading days (January 14 and 15) into a single settlement date (January 16). This may result in higher settlement volumes and requires participants to manage liquidity and positions accordingly.

**Liquidity Impact**: Members and custodians must ensure adequate funds and securities availability for the consolidated settlement on January 16, 2026. The auction timelines remain aligned with regular settlements to manage shortages.

**System Impact**: Participants must update their internal systems and reconciliation processes to reflect the revised settlement numbers and dates, particularly for the affected period around January 15.

**Risk Management**: Clearing corporations and members should account for the extended settlement cycle around the holiday when calculating margins, exposure, and collateral requirements.
