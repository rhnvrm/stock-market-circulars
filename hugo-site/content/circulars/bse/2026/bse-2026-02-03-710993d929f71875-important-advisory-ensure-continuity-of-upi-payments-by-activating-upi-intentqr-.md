## Summary

BSE has issued an important advisory to Mutual Fund Intermediaries (MFIs), Mutual Fund Distributors (MFDs), and Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) regarding changes to UPI payment processing. Payment Aggregators have indicated that the UPI Collect flow (Pay via UPI ID/Number) may be discontinued in the near future for one-time UPI payments. To ensure uninterrupted payment processing, members must activate and integrate UPI Intent/QR mode with their payment aggregators immediately.

## Key Points

- Action required to ensure seamless payment processing and avoid disruptions
- Members should contact their payment aggregator to confirm UPI Intent/QR integration
- Applies to MFIs, MFDs, and RIAs operating in the mutual fund segment

## Regulatory Changes

No formal regulatory change, but an operational update from Payment Aggregators indicating the potential discontinuation of UPI Collect flow for one-time payments. This represents a shift in the payment infrastructure that requires technical adaptation by market participants.
