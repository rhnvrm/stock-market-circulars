## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The revised price bands will restrict the daily price movement of these securities, with tighter bands (2-5%) indicating higher surveillance requirements. This may reduce intraday volatility but could also impact liquidity for the affected scrips.

**Market Participants**: Trading members and investors in these securities must be aware that price movements will be constrained within the new bands. The tighter bands suggest these securities may be under enhanced surveillance due to volatility concerns or other regulatory considerations.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading platforms need to update their systems immediately to prevent order rejections or trading disruptions when the new bands become effective.
