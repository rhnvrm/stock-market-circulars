  Debt Securities

## Summary

BSE has notified Trading Members of changes to the Scrip IDs in the BOLT Plus System for eight debt-listed securities of Muthoottu Mini Financiers, which has been renamed to Muthoot MCred Limited. This is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20260218-36 dated February 18, 2026, and the new Scrip IDs are effective from February 26, 2026.

## Key Points

- Eight debt-listed securities under Scrip Codes 730826, 730903, 937431, 937651, 938053, 939913, 940355, and 940363 are affected.
- The company name changes from **Muthoottu Mini Financiers** to **Muthoot MCred Limited** across all scrip codes.
- Old and new Scrip IDs in the BOLT Plus System are updated to reflect the abbreviated new name (e.g., `MML` prefix replaced by `MM`).
- The exception is Scrip Code 937651, whose new Scrip ID is `10MML27B` (minor suffix change).
- This notice is issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance & Operations.

## Regulatory Changes

This circular is a follow-up to Exchange Notice No. 20260218-36 (February 18, 2026), formalising the Scrip ID updates in the BOLT Plus System consequent to the corporate name change of the issuer from Muthoottu Mini Financiers to Muthoot MCred Limited.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must update their systems and records to use the new Scrip IDs in the BOLT Plus System for all eight affected debt securities.
- Members should cease using old Scrip IDs (e.g., `MML191225`, `MML070126`) and adopt the new IDs (e.g., `MM191225`, `MM070126`) from February 26, 2026.

| Scrip Code | Old Scrip ID | New Scrip ID |
|---|---|---|
| 730826 | MML191225 | MM191225 |
| 730903 | MML070126 | MM070126 |
| 937431 | 1025MML26 | 1025MM26 |
| 937651 | 10MML27 | 10MML27B |
| 938053 | 950MML26 | 950MM26 |
| 939913 | 10MML28 | 10MM28 |
| 940355 | 95MML27 | 95MM27 |
| 940363 | 1075MML30 | 1075MM30 |

## Important Dates

- **February 18, 2026**: Original Exchange Notice No. 20260218-36 issued.
- **February 25, 2026**: This follow-up notice issued.
- **February 26, 2026**: New Scrip IDs effective in the BOLT Plus System.

## Impact Assessment

This is a low-disruption operational update. Trading Members who use the BOLT Plus System to trade or monitor these eight debt securities must update their scrip ID references before February 26, 2026 to avoid order or settlement issues. The change is limited to the identifier strings in the trading system and does not affect the underlying securities, their terms, or listing status.
