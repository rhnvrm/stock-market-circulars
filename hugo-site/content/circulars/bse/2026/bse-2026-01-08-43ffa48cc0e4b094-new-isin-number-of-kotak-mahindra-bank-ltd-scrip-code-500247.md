---

## Summary

BSE has assigned a new ISIN number INE237A01036 to Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd (Scrip Code: 500247) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs.5/- to Re.1/-. The new ISIN will be effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of January 14, 2026. This notice continues from Exchange Notice No. 20251230-58 dated December 30, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd
- Scrip Code: 500247
- New ISIN: INE237A01036
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Old Face Value: Rs.5/- per share
- New Face Value: Re.1/- per share
- Reference: DR-798/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action involving ISIN reassignment following share sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to recognize the new ISIN INE237A01036 for trades from January 14, 2026
- All trading and settlement systems must be configured to handle the new ISIN for Re.1/- face value shares
- Demat accounts will reflect the adjusted number of shares with reduced face value

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 8, 2026
- **Ex-Date**: January 14, 2026 (new ISIN effective from this date)
- **Previous Notice**: December 30, 2025 (Notice No. 20251230-58)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The sub-division increases share liquidity by reducing per-share price, making the stock more accessible to retail investors. The 5:1 split ratio means shareholders will receive 5 shares of Re.1/- for every share of Rs.5/-.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and clearing systems must update ISIN mappings before the ex-date to ensure smooth trading and settlement. Historical data and reporting systems need to account for the ISIN change.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their holdings multiplied by 5 with proportionally reduced face value, maintaining the same total investment value. No action required from investors as the change is automatic in demat accounts.
