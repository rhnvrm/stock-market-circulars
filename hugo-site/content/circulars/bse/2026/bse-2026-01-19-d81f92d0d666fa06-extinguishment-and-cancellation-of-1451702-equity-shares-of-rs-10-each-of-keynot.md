This action is pursuant to the Scheme of Selective Capital Reduction of the Issued, Subscribed and Paid-Up share capital approved by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Mumbai Bench vide Order dated January 09, 2025. The scheme is implemented under Section 66 read with Section 52 and other applicable sections of the Companies Act, 2013 and National Company Law Tribunal (Procedure for Reduction of Share Capital of Company) Rules, 2016.

## Impact Assessment

This selective capital reduction will impact shareholders holding shares within the specified distinctive number ranges. The cancellation of 14.51 lakh shares represents a material change in the company's capital structure. The selective nature suggests targeted buyback or reduction from specific shareholders rather than a pro-rata reduction across all shareholders. Market participants should note the reduced share capital when evaluating the company's financials and shareholding patterns. The NCLT approval ensures the reduction is legally compliant and protects creditor interests.
