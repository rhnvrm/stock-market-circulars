---

## Summary

BSE has approved the listing and admission for trading of further equity shares issued by four companies under their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). The securities will commence trading on Friday, February 6, 2026. The issuances include ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited (224,000 shares), Larsen & Toubro Limited (30,657 shares), RBL Bank Limited (341,431 shares), and Wipro Limited (154,549 shares). None of the newly listed securities are subject to lock-in restrictions.

## Key Points

- Four companies have issued additional equity shares under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Trading of new securities begins February 6, 2026
- ICICI Prudential Life: 224,000 shares of ₹10 face value (ISIN: INE726G01019, Scrip: 540133)
- Larsen & Toubro: 30,657 shares of ₹2 face value (ISIN: INE018A01030, Scrip: 500510)
- RBL Bank: 341,431 shares of ₹10 face value (ISIN: INE976G01028, Scrip: 540065)
- Wipro: 154,549 shares of ₹2 face value (ISIN: INE075A01022, Scrip: 507685)
- No lock-in period applicable for any of the listed securities
- Distinctive numbers assigned for each batch of new shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine administrative notification for listing of securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must take note of the new securities and their trading commencement date
- Updated share capital information should be reflected in trading systems
- New ISIN distinctive number ranges must be recognized for settlement purposes

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 5, 2026
- **Trading Commencement**: February 6, 2026 (Friday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (NA for all securities)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The additional shares represent a small fraction of the outstanding equity for each company. ESOP-related listings are routine corporate actions that typically have negligible impact on stock prices or trading volumes.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in free float for the respective companies. The relatively small number of shares (ranging from 30,657 for L&T to 341,431 for RBL Bank) is unlikely to materially affect market liquidity.

**Operational Impact**: Routine operational update for market participants. Trading systems and databases need to reflect updated share capital and distinctive number ranges for accurate settlement and corporate action processing.
