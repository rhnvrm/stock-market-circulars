## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Negligible - This is a non-trading day mock session with no actual market transactions.

**Operational Impact:** Low to Medium - Trading members need to allocate resources for testing on a Saturday. This provides valuable opportunity to test systems, identify issues, and ensure readiness for actual trading scenarios including disaster recovery procedures.

**Technical Impact:** The release of BOLT Pro TWS version 12.50 and testing of BSE-NSE interoperability mechanism are important for system resilience and business continuity preparedness.
