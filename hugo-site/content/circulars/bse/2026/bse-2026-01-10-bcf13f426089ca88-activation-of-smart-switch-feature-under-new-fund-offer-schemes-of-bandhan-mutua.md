## Key Points

- SMART Switch feature activated for Bandhan Gold ETF FOF NFO
- Two switch routes enabled: from Bandhan Overnight Fund Regular Plan-Growth and Direct Plan-Growth
- Subscriptions received in the overnight fund schemes will be reported as switch-in transactions to Bandhan Gold ETF FOF
- Facility available on BSE StAR MF platform

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an operational platform feature activation.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements for market participants. This is a platform feature notification for mutual fund transactions.

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: January 10, 2026 (circular issue date)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a technical/operational enhancement specific to Bandhan Mutual Fund's NFO schemes on the BSE StAR MF platform. The SMART Switch feature provides automated switching convenience for investors moving from overnight fund schemes to the Gold ETF FOF during the NFO period. Impact is limited to Bandhan MF investors using this specific feature.
