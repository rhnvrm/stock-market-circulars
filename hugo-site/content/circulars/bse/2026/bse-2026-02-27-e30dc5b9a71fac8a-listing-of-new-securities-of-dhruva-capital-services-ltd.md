## Impact Assessment

**Dilution:** The addition of 31,28,636 shares to the existing float represents a capital increase via preferential allotment, which may have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders depending on the pre-allotment share count.

**Lock-in Breakdown:**
- 11,00,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 4061701–5161700) are locked in until 30 September 2027 — likely promoter shares subject to a longer lock-in.
- 20,28,636 shares (Dist. Nos. 5161701–7190336) are locked in until 30 September 2026 — likely non-promoter/institutional shares with a shorter lock-in.

**Market Impact:** Minimal short-term supply impact due to lock-in constraints. Post-lock-in expiry (September 2026 onwards), incremental selling pressure may emerge. Investors should note the phased unlocking schedule.
