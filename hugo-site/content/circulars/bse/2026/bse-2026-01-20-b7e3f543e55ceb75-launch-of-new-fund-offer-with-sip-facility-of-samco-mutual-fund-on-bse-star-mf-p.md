## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it is a routine NFO launch for a mid-cap mutual fund scheme. The impact is limited to BSE StAR MF Platform members and investors interested in mid-cap equity funds. The specific SIP requirements and payment timelines are operational guidelines that members must follow to ensure smooth processing of NFO subscriptions. The extended trading window for lumpsum purchases provides additional flexibility for investors.
