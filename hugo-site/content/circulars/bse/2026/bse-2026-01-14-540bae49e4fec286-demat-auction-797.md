## Impact Assessment

This demat auction affects trading members who have failed to deliver securities in the normal settlement cycle. The auction mechanism ensures settlement completion and maintains market integrity. While the number of scrips is significant (86), most quantities are relatively small except for a few outliers. The largest impact is on Tilak Ventures with nearly 6 million shares in auction, which may indicate significant delivery failures or settlement issues in that scrip. Trading participants with positions in these securities should monitor auction prices as they may differ from market prices.
