## Summary

BSE has issued Notice No. 20260224-10 informing trading members that two Treasury Bills listed on the debt segment will mature on their respective redemption dates and must not be traded from February 25, 2026 onwards. This is a routine action triggered by the scheduled maturity of these instruments.

## Key Points

- Two T-Bills are maturing and trading in them is suspended effective February 25, 2026
- Scrip Code **805110** (ISIN: IN002025Y222) — 182-day T-Bill: **182TB27226**
- Scrip Code **805033** (ISIN: IN002024Z461) — 364-day T-Bill: **364TB27226**
- Reference circular: DR-828/2025-2026
- Issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance & Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard operational notification under existing BSE procedures for T-Bill maturity and suspension of trading.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must **not deal in** scrip codes 805110 and 805033 from February 25, 2026
- Members holding positions in these T-Bills should ensure no new trades are executed on or after the suspension date
- Members are advised to take note and update their systems accordingly

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 24, 2026
- **Suspension Effective Date:** February 25, 2026 (Redemption/Maturity Date)

## Impact Assessment

Impact is minimal and routine. The suspension affects only the two listed T-Bill instruments (182-day and 364-day maturities) on the BSE debt segment. Holders will receive redemption proceeds on the maturity date as per standard RBI/government securities settlement procedures. No broader market disruption is expected.
