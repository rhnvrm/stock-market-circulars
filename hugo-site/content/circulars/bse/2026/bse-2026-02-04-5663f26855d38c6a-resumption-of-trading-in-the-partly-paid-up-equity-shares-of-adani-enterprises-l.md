**Market Impact**: Medium - Enables trading liquidity for substantial volume of partly paid shares (13.77 crore shares) of Adani Enterprises, allowing shareholders who paid the first call money to trade their holdings.

**Operational Impact**: The resumption affects approximately 99.49% of issued partly paid shares (13.77 crore out of 13.85 crore), indicating high participation in call money payment. The paid-up value of ₹0.75 per share suggests this is part of a structured rights issue payment schedule.
