- For clarifications, members may contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 24, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 25, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The revisions directly affect the daily trading range permissible for these 14 scrips. Tighter bands (2%) on scrips like Kalpa Commercial, Looks Health Services, Pro Clb Global, and Transchem indicate heightened surveillance concern. The wider 20% band for IRCTC suggests relaxation of restrictions, consistent with its large-cap, high-liquidity profile. SpiceJet's 10% band reflects moderate volatility management for the financially stressed airline. Traders and algorithmic systems must adjust order price limits before the effective date to avoid order rejections.
