---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for nine listed scrips effective February 27, 2026, as part of its ongoing surveillance function. The revised bands range from 2% to 20%, replacing existing band levels for each affected security.

## Key Points

- Nine scrips are subject to price band revisions effective February 27, 2026
- Revised price bands range from 2% (Transglobe Foods Ltd) to 20% (PAN HR Solution Ltd)
- The revision is issued under BSE's surveillance department (Notice No. 20260226-39)
- Trading members are advised to take note of the changes before market open on February 27, 2026
- For clarifications, members may contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

Price bands for the following scrips have been revised:

| Scrip Code | Scrip Name | Revised Price Band |
|------------|------------|--------------------|
| 533292 | A2Z Infra Engineering Ltd | 5% |
| 523467 | Jai Mata Glass Ltd | 10% |
| 544693 | Kanishk Aluminium India Ltd | 5% |
| 544437 | Marc Loire Fashions Ltd | 5% |
| 511535 | NDA Securities Ltd | 5% |
| 544698 | PAN HR Solution Ltd | 20% |
| 544456 | R M Drip and Sprinklers Systems Ltd | 10% |
| 538923 | Sofcom Systems Ltd | 10% |
| 519367 | Transglobe Foods Ltd | 2% |

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure their trading systems and risk management frameworks reflect the new price bands from February 27, 2026
- Members should not place orders outside the revised price band limits for the affected scrips
- Queries or clarifications should be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 27, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will directly constrain intraday price movement for the nine affected scrips. Scrips assigned narrower bands (e.g., 2% for Transglobe Foods Ltd and 5% for A2Z Infra Engineering, Kanishk Aluminium, Marc Loire Fashions, and NDA Securities) face tighter trading restrictions, indicating heightened surveillance concern. PAN HR Solution Ltd at 20% receives a relatively wider band. These changes are consistent with BSE's surveillance framework to manage volatility and protect market integrity in securities exhibiting unusual price or volume behaviour.
