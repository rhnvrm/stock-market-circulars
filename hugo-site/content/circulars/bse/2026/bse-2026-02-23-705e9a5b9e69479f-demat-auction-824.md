## Summary

BSE has published the Demat Auction list for Settlement No. 824, dated February 20, 2026. This circular identifies securities that failed delivery in demat form and are being put up for auction to fulfill outstanding settlement obligations.

## Key Points

- Settlement No. 824 auction was conducted on February 20, 2026
- 45 scrips are listed across the auction with varying quantities
- Largest quantities include: Gokul Refoil (2,668 shares), Vistar Amar (1,001 shares), MOIL Ltd (1,000 shares), Godfrey Phillips (649 shares), and Swan Corp (750 shares)
- Stocks span multiple sectors including energy, banking, technology, FMCG, and infrastructure
- Quantities per scrip range from 1 share (multiple scrips) to 2,668 shares (GOKUL REFOIL)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational notice under BSE's demat auction settlement process.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members with short delivery positions in the listed scrips must participate in or settle through the demat auction
- Buying members are entitled to receive auctioned shares at the auction price
- Members unable to deliver securities in demat form trigger auction proceedings per BSE settlement regulations

## Important Dates

- Auction Date: February 20, 2026 (Settlement No. 824)
- Circular Published: February 23, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Minimal broader market impact. Demat auctions are a routine settlement mechanism to address delivery shortfalls. The volumes involved are small relative to normal market turnover. Sellers who failed to deliver will bear the auction cost differential (auction price vs. original trade price plus applicable penalties). Individual scrip impact is limited to the specific quantities listed.
