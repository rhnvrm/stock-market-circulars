## Compliance Requirements

- Enhanced margin requirements and trade-for-trade settlement may apply depending on GSM stage
- Members should inform clients about the surveillance status of these securities

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: Not explicitly specified in the provided content

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The movement to higher GSM stages typically results in reduced liquidity, higher trading costs due to increased margins, and potential restrictions on intraday trading. Stage IV being the highest level indicates significant surveillance concerns for Ashoka Refineries and Bharat Textiles & Proofing Industries.

**Trading Impact:** Securities in higher GSM stages face trade-for-trade settlement, 100% margin requirements, and periodic call auctions only, significantly impacting liquidity and trading flexibility.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding these securities should be aware of increased trading restrictions and potential difficulty in exiting positions quickly. Higher stages indicate elevated risk levels as assessed by the exchange.
