## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard demat auction notice under existing BSE settlement and auction regulations for handling delivery shortfalls.

## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers with delivery obligations must participate in the auction settlement process
- Members must ensure funds availability for auction purchases
- Settlement obligations must be fulfilled as per BSE auction mechanism guidelines
- Non-compliance may result in penalties and further regulatory action as per BSE rules

## Important Dates

- **Auction Date**: January 20, 2026
- **Settlement Number**: 801

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects 75+ securities across multiple sectors, indicating systemic delivery failures in the settlement cycle. While most quantities are small (1-300 shares), some securities have significant quantities requiring auction.

**Operational Impact**: Direct impact on brokers and clearing members with failed delivery obligations who must participate in auction settlement. Price discovery through auction may result in higher costs for defaulting members.

**Investor Impact**: Indirect impact on investors whose delivery obligations failed, as brokers will pass through auction costs. Large quantity auctions (Teamo Produc, Murae Organi, AMD INDUSTRI) may see price volatility during auction settlement.
