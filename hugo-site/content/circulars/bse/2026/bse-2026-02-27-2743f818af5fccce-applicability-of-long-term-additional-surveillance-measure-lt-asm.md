## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers and members must apply enhanced margin requirements for securities newly added to LT-ASM (Part A) as per the applicable stage guidelines from March 02, 2026.
- For securities moved to lower stages (Part C), revised margin requirements corresponding to the new ASM stage apply from March 02, 2026.
- For securities exiting LT-ASM (Annexure II), normal trading and margin norms resume from March 02, 2026.
- Members should update their systems and client communications to reflect the revised ASM classifications.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** March 02, 2026 — all changes to the LT-ASM framework (additions, stage changes, and exits) become applicable.
- **Circular Date:** February 27, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a significant impact across a broad set of securities. The 7 newly added securities (Part A) will face elevated surveillance restrictions including higher margin requirements and potential trade-to-trade settlement, which typically reduces liquidity and increases transaction costs for investors. The 6 securities moving to lower ASM stages experience partial relaxation of restrictions, improving their trading conditions. The 25 securities exiting LT-ASM represent the largest group and will see full restoration of normal trading conditions, which may boost their liquidity and investor participation. Overall, this is a routine periodic review of the LT-ASM framework, but individual stocks affected — particularly new entrants and exits — may see notable price and volume reactions at market open on March 02, 2026.
