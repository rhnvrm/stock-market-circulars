## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational circular facilitating retail and institutional participation in government securities auctions. The non-competitive bidding facility allows smaller investors to participate in G-sec auctions without competing with larger institutional bidders. The two securities offered provide investment options across different maturity profiles - medium-term (2030) and long-term (2076). Trading members and their clients interested in fixed-income investments need to submit bids within specified timelines through BSE's designated platform.
