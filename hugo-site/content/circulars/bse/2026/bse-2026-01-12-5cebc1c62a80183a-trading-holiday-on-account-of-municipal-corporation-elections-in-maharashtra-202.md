  - Revised Settlement Schedule
---

## Summary

BSE has declared January 15, 2026 as a trading holiday due to Municipal Corporation Elections in Maharashtra. This circular revises the previously announced settlement schedule (Notice No. 20260109-66) to accommodate the trading holiday. All segments including Equity, SLB, Equity Derivatives, EGR, Currency Derivatives, and Commodity Derivatives will be affected with modified settlement dates.

## Key Points

- January 15, 2026 is now a trading holiday for all BSE segments
- Revised settlement schedules apply to multiple segments
- Transactions with trade date January 14, 2026 will settle on January 16, 2026 (instead of January 15, 2026)
- Transactions with trade date January 15, 2026 for EGR and Commodity Derivatives will settle on January 16, 2026
- No trading or settlement applicable for Equity, SLB, Equity Derivatives, and Currency Derivatives on January 15, 2026
- This circular supersedes Notice No. 20260109-66 dated January 09, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational announcement regarding a trading holiday and corresponding settlement schedule adjustments.

## Compliance Requirements

- All members must note the trading holiday on January 15, 2026
- Members must adjust their settlement expectations according to the revised schedule
- Systems and operations must be configured to accommodate the modified settlement dates
- All market participants must ensure their back-office systems reflect the updated settlement schedule

## Important Dates

- **January 12, 2026**: Circular notice date
- **January 14, 2026**: Trade date with revised settlement on January 16, 2026 (previously January 15, 2026)
- **January 15, 2026**: Trading holiday - no trading or settlement for Equity, SLB, Equity Derivatives, and Currency Derivatives segments
- **January 16, 2026**: Revised settlement date for trades from January 14, 2026 and January 15, 2026 (EGR and Commodity Derivatives only)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Complete trading halt across all BSE segments affecting all market participants.

**Settlement Impact**: All settlements scheduled for January 15, 2026 are pushed to January 16, 2026, creating a compressed settlement window and potential liquidity considerations.

**Operational Impact**: Members need to:
- Update trading calendars and settlement systems
- Adjust liquidity planning for the extended settlement cycle
- Communicate with clients about the trading holiday
- Reconfigure automated trading and settlement systems

**Segment-Specific Impact**:
- Equity, SLB, Equity Derivatives, Currency Derivatives: No trading or settlement on January 15, 2026
- EGR and Commodity Derivatives: Limited trading on January 15, 2026 with same-day settlement on January 16, 2026

**Risk Considerations**: Market participants should account for the extended settlement period when managing margin requirements and liquidity positions.
