## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of Aadhar Housing Finance Limited (AHFL) effective February 9, 2026. The suspension is implemented due to the company fixing a record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies to AHFL 7.05% debentures maturing on February 24, 2026 (ISIN: INE883F07256, Code: 973820)
- Record date for redemption and interest payment: February 9, 2026
- No dealings permitted from February 9, 2026 onwards
- Notice issued under reference number DR-816/2025-2026
- This is a standard corporate action procedure for debenture redemption

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine operational measure in accordance with existing BSE procedures for debt securities undergoing redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must not execute any trades in the specified AHFL debentures from February 9, 2026
- **Investors**: Cannot trade the affected debentures through BSE platform after the suspension date
- **Debenture holders**: Must hold securities as of record date to be eligible for redemption proceeds and interest payment

## Important Dates

- **January 30, 2026**: Notice issued by BSE
- **February 9, 2026**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **February 9, 2026**: Trading suspension becomes effective (no dealings permitted)
- **February 24, 2026**: Original maturity date of debentures

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of this specific NCD issue. The suspension is procedural and temporary, affecting only one debt instrument series. No broader market implications expected.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders should note they cannot exit positions through secondary market after February 9, 2026. Those wishing to sell must do so before suspension date. Holders as of record date will receive redemption proceeds and final interest payment as per debenture terms.

**Operational Impact**: Standard corporate action with minimal operational disruption. Trading members have adequate notice to inform clients and update systems.
