## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The buyback affects only Matrimony.com Limited shareholders. The offer size of 8,93,129 shares represents a specific portion of outstanding shares, which may provide exit opportunity to existing shareholders at Rs. 655 per share.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and custodians need to ensure their systems and UCC databases are updated to facilitate smooth participation. The 5-day offer window provides adequate time for shareholders to participate through their brokers.

**Liquidity Impact**: Temporary impact on Matrimony.com shares during the offer period as some shareholders may hold positions to participate in the buyback rather than trading in the regular market.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders of Matrimony.com Limited holding shares in demat form can tender their shares at the fixed price of Rs. 655, providing a guaranteed exit price during the offer period. The buyback may support the stock price during this period.
