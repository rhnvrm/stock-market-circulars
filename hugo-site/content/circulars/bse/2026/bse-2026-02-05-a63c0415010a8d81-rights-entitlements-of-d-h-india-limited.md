## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects existing shareholders of D & H INDIA LIMITED who hold rights entitlements and wish to either renounce their rights or acquire additional rights through market trading.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure proper client communication and include mandatory disclaimers in contract notes. The dematerialized-only and trade-for-trade settlement requirements necessitate proper back-office handling.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders have a 4-day window (February 09-12) to trade their rights entitlements before the rights issue closes on February 17. Investors must act within this timeframe or their unexercised rights will lapse.
