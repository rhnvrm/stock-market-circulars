- **Lock-in Expiry**: August 30, 2026 (for all 99,43,125 shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a company-specific listing event for W.S. Industries (India) Ltd. The preferential allotment increases the company's equity base by 99,43,125 shares. The lock-in period until August 30, 2026 ensures these shares cannot be sold immediately, limiting near-term supply pressure. The issuance to non-promoters may indicate capital raising for business expansion or working capital needs. No broader market implications expected.
