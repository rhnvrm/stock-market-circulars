title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) - Effective
  February 27, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has issued its periodic update on the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework. Effective February 27, 2026, six securities are being newly added to the Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM framework, while ten securities are being removed. No securities are being moved to higher or lower stages within the framework at this time.

## Key Points

- **6 securities added** to the ST-ASM framework effective February 27, 2026, including CL Educate Ltd, Jindal Poly Films Ltd, and Yatra Online Ltd (three of which are also flagged by NSE).
- **10 securities removed** from the ST-ASM framework effective February 27, 2026, including Easy Trip Planners Ltd and Rodium Realty Ltd.
- **No securities** are being moved to higher or lower ASM stages within the framework.
- Securities marked with `*` are co-listed on NSE and flagged as per NSE criteria.
- Securities marked with `@` are SME scrips.

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance in the form of additional margin requirements across short-term windows of 5, 15, and 30 days. Securities entering this framework face tighter trading conditions to protect investors from abnormal price movements.

*Note: Securities removed from ST-ASM may have been moved to LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge, or ESM frameworks as indicated by their respective markers.*

## Compliance Requirements

- **Brokers and trading members** must apply the applicable ST-ASM margin requirements for newly added securities from February 27, 2026.
- **Investors** holding or trading in newly added securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance and potential additional margin calls.
- Brokers must update their systems to reflect the removal of 10 securities from ST-ASM restrictions.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 27, 2026 (for both additions and removals)

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of **Jindal Poly Films Ltd** (a relatively larger-cap company) and **Yatra Online Ltd** in the ST-ASM framework is noteworthy, as both are NSE-flagged, indicating cross-exchange surveillance alignment. Traders in these securities will face additional margin requirements, which may dampen short-term speculative activity. The removal of 10 securities, including Easy Trip Planners Ltd and Rodium Realty Ltd, provides relief to those market participants and may support liquidity recovery in those counters. Overall, this is a routine surveillance cycle update with moderate market impact limited to the specific scrips listed.
