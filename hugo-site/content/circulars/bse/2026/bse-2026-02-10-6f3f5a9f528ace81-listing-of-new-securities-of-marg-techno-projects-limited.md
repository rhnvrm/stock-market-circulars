## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a preferential allotment to Promoters and Non-Promoters with significant lock-in periods, limiting immediate tradability. The 14 lakh shares represent internal capital raising and will not impact market liquidity in the short term.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Standard listing procedure requiring no action from market participants except awareness of the lock-in restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: The lock-in periods protect existing shareholders from immediate dilution through secondary market sales, with majority of shares (60.7%) locked until August 2027.
