## Summary

BSE has notified the listing of further securities issued by companies under Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) or Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). The circular provides details of share ranges with their respective lock-in status and lock-in periods for three distinct tranches totaling 9,960 shares.

## Key Points

- Total shares listed: 9,960 shares across three tranches
- Share range 51821983 to 51826828: 4,846 shares with lock-in
- Share range 51826829 to 51831807: 4,979 shares without lock-in
- Share range 51831808 to 51831942: 135 shares with lock-in
- Lock-in period for applicable shares: One year from January 13, 2026 to January 12, 2027

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for ESOP/ESOS shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must adhere to lock-in requirements for specified share ranges
- Shares under lock-in (ranges 1 and 3) cannot be traded until January 12, 2027
- Middle tranche (range 2) has no lock-in restrictions and can be traded immediately

## Important Dates

- Lock-in Start Date: January 13, 2026
- Lock-in End Date: January 12, 2027
- Circular Date: January 22, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. This is a routine administrative process for listing employee stock options with standard one-year lock-in provisions for certain tranches. The total number of shares (9,960) represents a small volume unlikely to significantly affect market liquidity or trading patterns. Only the middle tranche of 4,979 shares is immediately tradeable.
