## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it relates to the operational activation of a specific interval fund scheme. The impact is limited to:

- Investors interested in NIPPON INDIA QUARTERLY INTERVAL FUND - SERIES II can participate during the two-day transaction window
- BSE StAR MF platform members need to configure systems to accept transactions for the six scheme variants
- Payment processing teams must enforce restrictions on MICR Cheque, Nodal and OTM payments

The interval fund structure provides quarterly liquidity windows, making this a routine activation for a predetermined transaction period.
