## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The circular involves listing of only 19,740 partly paid-up equity shares, representing a very small fraction of the company's total equity. This is a routine administrative listing following call money receipt and will have negligible impact on stock price or trading volumes.

**Operational Impact**: Standard listing procedure with all regulatory approvals obtained from both BSE and NSE. The shares are immediately available for trading with no restrictions or lock-in period.
