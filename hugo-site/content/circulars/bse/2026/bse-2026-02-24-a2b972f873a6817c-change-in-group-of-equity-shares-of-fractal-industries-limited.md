## Summary

BSE has announced that the equity shares of Fractal Industries Limited (SME IPO, Scrip Code: 544707) will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to the Rolling segment (M Group) effective Wednesday, March 11, 2026. This notice is issued in continuation of BSE Notice No. 20260223-23 dated February 23, 2026.

## Key Points

- Scrip Code: 544707 (FRACTAL INDUSTRIES LIMITED - SME IPO)
- Transfer from Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to Rolling segment (M Group)
- Effective date: Wednesday, March 11, 2026
- Continuation of earlier Notice No. 20260223-23 dated February 23, 2026
- Contact: Mr. Anurag Jain, Tel. No. 022-2272 8822

## Regulatory Changes

The equity shares of Fractal Industries Limited will move from the MT Group (Trade for Trade settlement) to the M Group (Rolling settlement). Under the Trade for Trade (MT Group) segment, each trade must result in delivery; netting of positions is not permitted. Moving to the Rolling segment (M Group) allows for normal settlement under rolling settlement cycles and permits intraday netting.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must take note of the segment change effective March 11, 2026
- Orders and positions in the scrip must be managed in accordance with the new M Group rules from the effective date
- Members may contact Mr. Anurag Jain at 022-2272 8822 for further clarification

## Important Dates

- **February 23, 2026**: Original notice (No. 20260223-23) issued
- **February 24, 2026**: This continuation notice issued
- **March 11, 2026**: Effective date of transfer from MT Group to M Group

## Impact Assessment

This change benefits traders by allowing netting of positions and standard rolling settlement for Fractal Industries Limited shares, which improves liquidity and trading flexibility. The transition from Trade for Trade (mandatory delivery) to Rolling segment is a standard post-IPO regulatory progression for SME-listed companies, indicating normalization of trading in this scrip. Impact is moderate and limited to trading members actively dealing in Scrip Code 544707.
