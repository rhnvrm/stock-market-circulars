## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing of preferential allotment shares to promoters. All 2,68,75,000 shares are subject to complete lock-in until September 30, 2027, preventing immediate trading by allottees. The impact on market liquidity and price discovery is minimal as these shares cannot be traded for approximately 1.5 years. The preferential allotment represents capital raising by the company from its promoters, potentially strengthening the promoter holding and company's capital base.
