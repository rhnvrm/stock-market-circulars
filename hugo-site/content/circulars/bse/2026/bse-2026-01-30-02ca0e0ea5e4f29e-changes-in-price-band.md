title: Changes in Price Band for 34 Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 34 securities effective February 01, 2026. The price bands range from 2% to 20%, representing various levels of trading restrictions applied under surveillance measures. Trading members have been notified of these changes which will impact daily price movement limits for the affected securities.

## Key Points

- 34 securities will have revised price bands effective February 01, 2026
- Price band percentages vary: 2% (2 securities), 5% (15 securities), 10% (11 securities), and 20% (6 securities)
- Changes apply to equity segment securities
- Notice issued on January 30, 2026 (Notice No. 20260130-28)
- Members can seek clarification at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions represent surveillance measures to control volatility in specific securities. Tighter bands (2%-5%) indicate stricter surveillance, while wider bands (10%-20%) allow relatively more price movement. The changes reflect BSE's ongoing monitoring of market activities and risk assessment for individual securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure all trading systems are updated with revised price bands before market opening on February 01, 2026
- Orders exceeding the new price bands will be rejected
- Members should communicate these changes to clients trading in affected securities
- Surveillance team contact for clarifications: bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 30, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 01, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Moderate. The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements for 34 securities, potentially reducing volatility but also limiting trading opportunities. Securities with tighter bands (2%-5%) will face significant trading constraints.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update risk management systems and inform clients about reduced price movement limits. Securities with 2% bands (Gujarat Inject Kerala Ltd, Sarup Industries Ltd) will have severely restricted trading ranges.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these securities may experience reduced liquidity and limited ability to enter/exit positions at desired prices within a single trading session.
