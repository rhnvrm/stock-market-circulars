## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the listing of these new securities
- Lock-in restrictions apply to all 1,00,000 shares until August 31, 2026
- Shares must be traded under existing scrip code 531512

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. The allotment represents a small increase to the company's equity base through warrant conversion. The six-month lock-in period (until August 31, 2026) restricts immediate liquidity of these shares. This is a routine corporate action with standard preferential allotment terms for non-promoter investors.
