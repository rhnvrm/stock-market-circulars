title: Introduction of Closing Auction Session (CAS) in the Equity Cash Segment and
  certain modifications in the Pre-Open Auction Session
---

## Summary

SEBI has mandated the introduction of Closing Auction Session (CAS) in the equity cash segment to determine closing prices for stocks on which derivative contracts are available. The CAS will operate from 3:15 PM to 3:35 PM as a separate 20-minute session, replacing the current Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) method based on last 30 minutes of trading. This change aligns Indian markets with global practices and aims to provide fair, transparent closing prices for derivatives settlement, index computation, and mutual fund NAV determination.

## Key Points

- CAS introduced as separate 20-minute session from 3:15 PM to 3:35 PM on all trading days
- Initially applicable only to stocks on which derivative contracts are available
- Remaining securities will continue using VWAP of last 30 minutes of Continuous Trading Session
- Order entry session closes randomly between 3:28 PM to 3:30 PM (system-driven)
- Equity derivatives segment continues to operate until 3:40 PM
- Post-close session operates 3:50 PM to 4:00 PM for trades at closing price
- Session structure: 5 min transition + 5 min order entry (limit & market) + 5 min order entry (limit only) with random close + 5 min matching
- Market orders cannot be modified/cancelled in last 5 minutes before random close
- Benefits include aggregated liquidity, fair price discovery, reduced tracking error for passive funds

## Regulatory Changes

**Closing Price Determination Method:**
- Current: VWAP of trades in last 30 minutes of Continuous Trading Session
- New (for derivative stocks): Price discovered through Closing Auction Session

**Trading Session Structure:**

- Equity Derivatives: Continues until 3:40 PM (no change)
- Post-Close Session: 3:50 PM to 4:00 PM (adjusted timing)

**CAS Session Phases:**
1. Reference price calculation/Transition (3:15 PM - 5 minutes)
2. Order entry - limit and market orders (3:20 PM - 5 minutes)
3. Order entry - limit orders only, no modification/cancellation of market orders, random close in last 2 minutes (3:25 PM - 5 minutes)
