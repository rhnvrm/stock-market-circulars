---

## Summary

Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company Limited has announced a scheme name change effective January 14, 2026, and declared January 15, 2026 as a non-business day for all schemes due to Maharashtra municipal elections. The scheme "Motilal Oswal Gold and Silver ETFs Fund of Funds" has been renamed to "Motilal Oswal Gold and Silver Passive Fund of Funds" to align with the scheme category.

## Key Points

- Scheme name changed from "Motilal Oswal Gold and Silver ETFs Fund of Funds" to "Motilal Oswal Gold and Silver Passive Fund of Funds"
- Name change effective from January 14, 2026
- January 15, 2026 declared as non-business day due to Maharashtra municipal elections (public holiday)
- All transactions received on January 15, 2026 will be processed on January 16, 2026 at applicable NAV
- Name change is to align scheme name with the category of the scheme

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an administrative adjustment to align scheme nomenclature with scheme category requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors should note the new scheme name for all future correspondence and transactions
- Investors should be aware that transactions on January 15, 2026 will be processed on the next business day

## Important Dates

- **January 14, 2026**: Scheme name change effective date
- **January 15, 2026**: Non-business day for all Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund schemes (Maharashtra municipal elections)
- **January 16, 2026**: Next business day for processing transactions received on January 15, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Minimal impact. This is a nomenclature change that does not affect the investment strategy, portfolio composition, or operations of the scheme. The non-business day declaration is a routine administrative measure for a regional public holiday. Investors in the affected scheme should use the new name for future transactions and correspondence. Transaction processing delay of one day for January 15, 2026 submissions is standard procedure for non-business days.
