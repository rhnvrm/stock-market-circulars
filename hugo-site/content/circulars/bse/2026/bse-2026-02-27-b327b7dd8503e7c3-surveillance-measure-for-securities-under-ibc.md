title: BSE Surveillance Measure for Securities under IBC - Effective March 02, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update to its Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) for companies subject to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Effective **March 02, 2026**, 9 securities are being moved to Stage 0 (Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company). No new securities are being shortlisted under Stage 1 or Stage 2, and no securities are being excluded from IBC-ASM in this cycle.

## Key Points

- **9 securities** are being moved to IBC-ASM Stage 0 (corporate announcement/disclosure stage) effective March 02, 2026
- **No new additions** to Stage 1 (IRP shortlisted) or Stage 2 in this update
- **No stage transitions** from Stage I to Stage II or Stage II to Stage I
- **No exclusions** from IBC-ASM in this period
- Consolidated list (Annexure III) includes securities across multiple IBC stages
- Scrips marked `(^)` are recommencement scrips; scrips marked `(*)` are as per NSE data

## Regulatory Changes

This circular updates the IBC surveillance framework under BSE's Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) regime. The IBC-ASM framework operates in stages:
- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure — initial monitoring level
- **Stage 1**: Company shortlisted under Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP)
- **Stage 2**: Elevated surveillance for companies deeper in IBC proceedings

No structural changes to the framework are introduced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and investors should note the updated IBC-ASM list before executing trades in the listed scrips
- Securities under IBC-ASM may be subject to additional margin requirements, price bands, or trade-for-trade settlement as applicable to their stage
- Market participants should refer to the consolidated list in Annexure III for the complete current IBC-ASM universe

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: March 02, 2026 — all stage changes and new additions take effect
- **Circular Date**: February 27, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Securities moving to Stage 0 (Annexure II) effective March 02, 2026:**

| Sr. No. | Scrip Code | ISIN | Scrip Name |
|---------|------------|------|------------|
| 1 | 504697 | INE255C01026 | Galada Power & Telecommunication Ltd^ |
| 2 | 532887 | INE333I01044 | Neueon Corporation Ltd |
| 3 | 517230 | INE766A01026 | PAE Ltd |
| 4 | 500322 | INE167E01037 | Panyam Cements & Mineral Industries Ltd^ |
| 5 | 539673 | INE792P01020 | Radhagobind Commercial Ltd |
| 6 | 512197 | INE798C01017 | Silveroak Commercials Ltd |
| 7 | 533107 | INE542F01020 | Swan Defence And Heavy Industries Ltd |
| 8 | 531574 | INE192C01013 | Vas Infrastructure Ltd |
| 9 | 517399 | INE756A01019 | VXL Instruments Ltd |

The impact is moderate and confined to the specific scrips listed. Stage 0 placement signals early-stage IBC monitoring and may lead to heightened investor caution. Traders in these securities should be aware of potential additional surveillance conditions. The broader market is unaffected.
