## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and traders of this specific debenture series. The suspension is procedural following the company's buyback and full redemption decision. No broader market impact expected as this affects only one debt instrument. Investors holding these debentures will receive redemption proceeds as per the buyback terms. The suspension prevents any inadvertent trading after the instrument has been redeemed.
