## Impact Assessment

The listing increases the tradable equity share base of Gowra Leasing & Finance Ltd. However, a significant portion of the newly listed shares (13,91,300 shares, approximately 60.6%) are locked in until August 30, 2027, limiting the immediate free-float addition. The remaining ~9,02,100 shares (locked until August 30, 2026) will become freely tradable at a nearer date. Market impact is expected to be minimal given the company's small-cap profile and the lock-in restrictions on the majority of new shares.
