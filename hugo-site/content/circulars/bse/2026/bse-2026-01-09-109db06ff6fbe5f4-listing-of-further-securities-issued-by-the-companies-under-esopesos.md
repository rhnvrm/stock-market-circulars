## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The total number of shares being listed (201,115) represents a small fraction of the outstanding shares for these companies, particularly for large-cap stocks like AXIS Bank. ESOP issuances are routine corporate actions that typically have negligible impact on stock prices.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in float for all companies. The largest issuance is AXIS Bank with 138,572 shares, which is insignificant compared to its total market capitalization.

**Operational Impact**: Standard listing process with no special trading restrictions or conditions. Market participants need only update their records to reflect the increased share capital.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may experience minimal dilution due to the small quantum of shares being issued. No immediate action required from investors.
