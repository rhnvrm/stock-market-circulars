## Summary

Titan Biotech Ltd (Scrip Code: 524717) has set February 20, 2026 as the record date for the sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs.10/- will be subdivided into five equity shares with a face value of Rs.2/- each. The current ISIN INE150C01011 will become invalid for transactions from the effective date, and a new ISIN for the Rs.2/- paid-up shares will be announced separately.

## Key Points

- Stock split ratio: 1:5 (one share of Rs.10/- becomes five shares of Rs.2/-)
- Record date: February 20, 2026
- Effective date: February 20, 2026
- Current ISIN (INE150C01011) will be invalid for transactions from February 20, 2026 onwards
- New ISIN for Rs.2/- face value shares to be announced separately
- Notice reference: DR-825/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced. This is a corporate action involving stock subdivision in compliance with existing regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date of February 20, 2026
- All transactions on or after February 20, 2026 must use the new ISIN for Rs.2/- paid-up shares
- The existing ISIN INE150C01011 (Rs.10/- paid-up) will not be valid for exchange transactions from the effective date
- Market participants should await separate notice for the new ISIN details

## Important Dates

- **January 21, 2026**: Circular issued
- **February 20, 2026**: Record date for sub-division
- **February 20, 2026**: Effective date - old ISIN becomes invalid, new sub-divided shares become tradeable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The stock split increases the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the face value proportionally, making shares more affordable for retail investors. This typically improves liquidity and trading volumes without affecting the company's market capitalization.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems and demat accounts will need to reflect the new share structure from February 20, 2026. The ISIN change requires system updates across depositories, trading platforms, and broker systems.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. The total investment value remains unchanged, but the number of shares and per-share price will adjust accordingly.
