The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) is a framework implemented by stock exchanges to enhance market surveillance and protect investor interests. Securities are placed under ESM based on specific criteria related to price movements, trading volumes, corporate governance issues, or other regulatory concerns. The framework operates in multiple stages with progressively stricter surveillance and trading restrictions.

- Securities under ESM may have additional disclosure requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 2, 2026
- **Circular Date**: January 1, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Securities newly added to ESM may experience reduced liquidity due to increased investor caution
- Trading volumes in affected securities may decline as surveillance measures intensify
- Securities moving to higher ESM stages face stricter monitoring and potential additional restrictions

**Investor Impact:**
- Investors holding these securities should review their positions and assess risk exposure
- New investments in ESM securities require enhanced due diligence
- Potential impact on stock prices due to negative sentiment associated with ESM classification

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers and trading members must update their systems to reflect ESM status changes
- Compliance teams need to ensure proper disclosures and risk warnings to clients
