## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Demat auctions are routine settlement mechanisms but can impact price discovery for the securities listed, particularly those with larger quantities. The presence of high-profile stocks like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Adani Ports, and Ola Electric indicates failed delivery obligations that need resolution.

**Operational Impact:** Affects members with delivery obligations for these 138 scrips. Auction mechanism ensures settlement completion but may result in higher costs for defaulting members.

**Investor Impact:** Limited direct impact on retail investors. Institutional and broker-dealer participants with failed trades will need to fulfill obligations through the auction process.
