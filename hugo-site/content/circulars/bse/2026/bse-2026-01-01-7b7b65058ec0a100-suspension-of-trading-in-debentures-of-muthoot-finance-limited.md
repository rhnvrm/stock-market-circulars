## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in specific non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of Muthoot Finance Limited (Code: MFL-8.25%-25-1-26-NCD, ISIN: INE414G07IU0, Scrip Code: 939210). The suspension is effective from January 9, 2026, due to the company setting a record date of January 10, 2026, for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are strictly advised not to deal in these debentures from the specified date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies to specific NCDs: MFL-8.25%-25-1-26-NCD (ISIN: INE414G07IU0)
- Scrip Code: 939210
- Record date set for January 10, 2026
- No dealings permitted from January 9, 2026 onwards
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Notice reference: DR-795/2025-2026
- Issued by: Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance And Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action procedure where trading is suspended before the record date to ensure proper settlement and entitlement determination for debenture holders eligible for redemption and interest payment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified NCDs from January 9, 2026
- All trading members of BSE are required to take note of this suspension
- Members must ensure their systems and operations reflect the trading halt for scrip code 939210
- Compliance with corporate action procedures for debt securities

## Important Dates

- **January 1, 2026**: Notice date and circular issuance
- **January 9, 2026**: Trading suspension begins (no dealings permitted from this date)
- **January 10, 2026**: Record date for redemption and interest payment eligibility

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The trading suspension affects only the specific NCD series of Muthoot Finance Limited. Holders of these debentures will not be able to trade them from January 9, 2026. This is a routine corporate action with limited broader market impact.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these NCDs as of the record date will be entitled to redemption proceeds and interest payment. Those wishing to acquire or exit positions must do so before January 9, 2026. The suspension protects the integrity of the corporate action process by preventing trades that could complicate settlement.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trades in scrip code 939210 from January 9, 2026. The debt market segment will see reduced activity in this specific instrument, but overall debt market operations remain unaffected.
