## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The one-day advancement of ex-dates affects trading and settlement timelines for debt market participants holding or trading these securities. Investors must be in position by January 14 instead of January 15 to be eligible for corporate actions.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and custodians need to update their systems and processes to reflect the revised ex-dates, particularly for automated corporate action processing. The compressed timeline may require expedited communication with clients regarding eligibility changes.

**Investor Impact**: Investors intending to participate in these corporate actions must ensure positions are established by the revised ex-date of January 14, 2026, one day earlier than originally scheduled.
