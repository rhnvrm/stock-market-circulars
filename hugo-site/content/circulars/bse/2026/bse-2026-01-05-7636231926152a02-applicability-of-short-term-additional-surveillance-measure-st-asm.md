## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term ASM Framework is designed to alert investors about securities exhibiting abnormal price movements. Securities in this framework face enhanced surveillance measures including stricter price bands, higher margin requirements, and trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors trading in securities under ST-ASM Framework must comply with enhanced surveillance measures
- Securities marked with special symbols (@, ~, *) have additional characteristics or restrictions
- SME scrips and T+0 scrips have specific applicability conditions
- Securities may move between frameworks (LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge, ESM)

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 06, 2026 - Changes to ST-ASM Framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 8 securities to ST-ASM Framework will result in enhanced surveillance and trading restrictions for these stocks, potentially impacting liquidity and investor participation. The removal of 8 securities indicates improved price stability or migration to other surveillance frameworks. Investors in affected securities should be aware of the enhanced margin requirements and potential trading limitations that come with ST-ASM classification. The framework serves as an investor protection mechanism to curb excessive speculation and price manipulation.
