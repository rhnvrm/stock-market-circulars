## Debenture Details

### Series 1: PFSPL-14%-31-3-26-PVT
- **ISIN**: INE514Q07338
- **Code**: 975517

## Impact Assessment

The part redemption will result in reduced outstanding principal for both debenture series. Debenture holders will receive partial return of principal along with accrued interest. The reduced face values indicate substantial redemption amounts, with approximately 58% reduction for the first series (from typical Rs. 10,000 face value to Rs. 4,166.82) and approximately 17% reduction for the second series (to Rs. 8,333.48). Trading members and investors holding these instruments must adjust their portfolio valuations and track the reduced face values for subsequent interest calculations and final redemption.
