## Impact Assessment

This order reinforces SEBI's enforcement actions against front running activities and market manipulation. The case sets a precedent for handling front running allegations involving mutual fund schemes. While the immediate impact is limited to the specific individuals involved, it serves as a deterrent for similar manipulative practices. Market participants should note the serious consequences including disgorgement of illegal gains, substantial penalties, and lengthy market debarment for engaging in front running activities. The involvement of multiple family members (Dhadda family) and associates suggests coordinated trading activity that attracted regulatory scrutiny.
