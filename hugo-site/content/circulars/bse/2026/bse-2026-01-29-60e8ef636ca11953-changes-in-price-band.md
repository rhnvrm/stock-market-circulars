## Securities Affected

|------------|--------------|--------------------|

| 531210 | Colinz Laboratories Ltd | 10% |
| 532957 | Gokak Textiles Ltd | 10% |

## Regulatory Changes

Price band is a regulatory mechanism that limits the maximum price movement (up or down) a security can experience during a trading session. The revised bands indicate different levels of volatility controls being applied to these securities based on surveillance criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure all trades in these securities comply with the new price band limits
- Orders exceeding the price band will be rejected by the trading system
- Members should update their systems and inform clients about the revised trading limits
- For clarifications, members may contact BSE at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 29, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 30, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The revised price bands will restrict intraday price volatility for these securities. Stocks with narrower bands (2% and 5%) will experience tighter trading ranges, potentially reducing speculative activity and protecting investors from excessive price swings. Securities with wider bands (10% and 20%) may continue to experience higher volatility within their permitted ranges. Trading members and investors need to adjust their trading strategies accordingly for these securities.
