## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine listing notification pursuant to existing SEBI regulations governing ESOP/ESOS issuances.

## Compliance Requirements

- All market participants are required to take note of the new securities listed
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital
- Depository participants should ensure proper crediting of securities to employee demat accounts

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 3, 2026
- **Listing and Trading Commencement**: February 4, 2026
- **Lock-in Period**: Not Applicable (NA) for all securities

## Impact Assessment

The impact is minimal as these are routine ESOP allotments representing small percentages of respective companies' equity capital. The absence of lock-in periods indicates these are standard vesting-based issuances. Market participants should note the minor dilution in outstanding shares for position calculations and corporate action processing.
