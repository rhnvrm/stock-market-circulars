## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects holders and traders of the two specific debenture series of Lodha Developers Ltd. The part redemption results in significant reduction in face values, which impacts pricing and valuation.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members dealing in these debentures must update their systems and processes to reflect the new face values. The reduced face values are substantial (Rs. 89,512 and Rs. 98,454 per debenture respectively), indicating significant partial redemption amounts have been paid out to debenture holders.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders have received partial redemption proceeds, and their remaining investment now has a lower face value basis for future interest calculations and final redemption.
