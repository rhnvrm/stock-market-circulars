## Important Dates

| Settlement No. | Trade Date | Custodian Confirmation | Settlement Date | Auction Trade Date | Auction Settlement Date | Pay-in Time |
|----------------|------------|------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| 2526812 | Feb 3, 2026 | Feb 4, 2026 | Feb 4, 2026 | Feb 5, 2026 | Feb 6, 2026 | 8:00 AM |
| 2526813 | Feb 4, 2026 | Feb 5, 2026 | Feb 5, 2026 | Feb 5, 2026 | Feb 6, 2026 | 8:00 AM |

**Critical Deadline:** Pay-in instructions to Depositories/Banks must be submitted by 7:50 AM on auction settlement date (February 6, 2026)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** High - Members and custodians must adjust their settlement operations to accommodate the revised auction schedule. The one-day postponement of the auction trade date (from February 4 to February 5, 2026) requires immediate updates to internal settlement systems and processes.

**Timeline Impact:** The revision provides members with an additional day between the original settlement date (February 4) and the auction trade date (now February 5), potentially allowing more time for settlement preparation.

**Risk Management:** Members must ensure compliance with the tight deadline for pay-in instructions (7:50 AM), as failure to meet this deadline could result in direct close-out for shortages in specified categories as per existing BSE procedures established in May 2019.
