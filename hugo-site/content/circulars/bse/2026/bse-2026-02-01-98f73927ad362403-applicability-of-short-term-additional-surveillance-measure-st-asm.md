## Impact Assessment

The ST-ASM framework is designed to curb excessive speculation and volatility in securities. Securities under this measure face additional surveillance including potential price bands, margin requirements, and trading restrictions. Companies newly added may experience reduced liquidity and increased compliance scrutiny. Investors should exercise caution when trading these securities. The movement of Vivimed Labs to a higher stage indicates continued concern about its trading patterns.
