## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine listing notification for a preferential allotment of equity shares following warrant conversion. The total number of shares (5,99,160) represents a relatively modest addition to the company's equity base. Lock-in provisions ensure that the majority of shares (5,40,000) will be restricted from trading until July 2026, with a smaller portion (59,160 shares) locked until July 2027. Trading members can commence trading these securities from January 2, 2026, subject to lock-in restrictions.
