## Impact Assessment

This is a routine post-IPO regulatory disclosure with no immediate market impact. The presence of locked-in shares across promoter and public categories is standard for newly listed IPO companies and restricts near-term selling pressure from those holdings. No encumbrances or pledges on promoter shares indicate a clean shareholding structure at listing. The circular is informational and relevant primarily to investors and analysts tracking KIAASA RETAIL LIMITED's ownership structure.
