- Segment: Equity
- Notice Number: 20260106-2

- Note the exclusion of Sayaji Industries Limited from PCAS

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** January 6, 2026
- **Effective Date:** Wednesday, January 7, 2026
- **Previous Notice Date:** January 5, 2026 (Notice 20260105-10)

## Impact Assessment

The exclusion from PCAS is a positive development for Sayaji Industries Limited shareholders and traders. Stocks under PCAS face trading restrictions with only two call auction sessions per day, limiting liquidity. The exclusion indicates improved compliance or resolution of issues that led to PCAS placement. This will enhance liquidity, improve price discovery, and provide better trading opportunities for market participants in this stock. The impact is limited to this single security and its stakeholders.
