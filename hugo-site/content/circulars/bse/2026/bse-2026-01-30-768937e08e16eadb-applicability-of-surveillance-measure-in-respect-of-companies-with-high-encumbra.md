## Summary

BSE has issued an updated list of securities under surveillance measures for companies with high 'Encumbrance' as per Regulation 28(3) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulation 2011, effective February 01, 2026. No new securities have been added to the framework. One security, Panorama Studios International Ltd, has been removed from the high encumbrance framework as it has been included in the Short-term Additional Surveillance Measure (STASM) Framework. The consolidated list now contains 11 securities under this surveillance measure.

## Key Points

- Effective date: February 01, 2026
- No new securities added to high encumbrance surveillance (Annexure I shows 'Nil')
- One security moving out: Panorama Studios International Ltd (Scrip Code: 539469, ISIN: INE258R01028)
- Panorama Studios moved out due to inclusion in STASM Framework
- Consolidated list contains 11 securities under high encumbrance surveillance

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the surveillance framework under SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulation 2011, specifically Regulation 28(3) which deals with encumbrance of shares. The framework identifies companies where promoter shareholding has high levels of encumbrance (pledges, liens, or other security interests), which may pose risks to investors and market stability.

## Compliance Requirements

Market participants should note:
- Securities under this surveillance measure may face additional monitoring and trading restrictions
- Investors should exercise caution when trading in these securities
- Companies in the consolidated list must comply with disclosure requirements regarding encumbrance levels
- Transition of securities between different surveillance frameworks (high encumbrance to STASM/LTASM) requires adherence to respective framework rules
