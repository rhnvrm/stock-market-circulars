## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the change in settlement type for YASHHTEJ INDUSTRIES (INDIA) LIMITED from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment effective March 12, 2026.

## Important Dates

- **February 24, 2026**: Original notice issued (No. 20260224-17).
- **February 25, 2026**: Continuation notice issued (No. 20260225-2).
- **March 12, 2026**: Effective date of transfer from MT Group (Trade for Trade) to M Group (Rolling segment).

## Impact Assessment

This change has low market impact as it is a routine transition for an SME IPO scrip moving out of the mandatory Trade for Trade settlement phase into normal Rolling settlement. Post-transition, the scrip will be subject to standard rolling settlement netting, which may improve liquidity and ease of trading for retail and institutional participants. No broader market or systemic implications are expected.
