Trading members must follow the modified reporting deadlines for trades executed from January 30 to February 02, 2026.

## Key Points

- Special trading session scheduled for Sunday, February 01, 2026 due to Union Budget presentation
- Modified reporting schedule applies for holding statements covering trade dates from January 30 to February 02, 2026
- All holding statements for January 30, 31, and February 01 are due on February 02, 2026
- Regular schedule resumes for February 02 trades (due February 03, 2026)
- Reference made to Exchange Notice no. 20230127-8 dated January 27, 2023 on holding statement submission
- Reference made to Exchange Notice no. 20260116-33 dated January 16, 2026 on Union Budget trading session

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a temporary modification to the holding statement reporting schedule to accommodate the exceptional trading session on a Sunday.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must:
- Report holding statements for trade date January 30, 2026 by February 02, 2026
- Report holding statements for trade date January 31, 2026 by February 02, 2026

- Ensure compliance with the modified schedule to avoid non-compliance issues

## Important Dates

| Trade Date | Holding Statement Due Date |
|------------|---------------------------|
| January 30, 2026 | February 02, 2026 |
| January 31, 2026 | February 02, 2026 |
| February 01, 2026 | February 02, 2026 |
| February 02, 2026 | February 03, 2026 |

**Key Date:** February 01, 2026 - Live trading session on Sunday due to Union Budget presentation

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to adjust their reporting processes to accommodate the consolidated reporting deadline of February 02, 2026 for three consecutive trade dates. This may require additional coordination and resource allocation over the weekend.

**Market Impact:** Low direct market impact as this is an administrative adjustment. The main operational change is the bunching of reporting obligations, which could create increased workload for compliance teams on February 02, 2026.

**Compliance Risk:** Members must ensure their systems and processes can handle the modified schedule to avoid reporting delays or non-compliance penalties.
