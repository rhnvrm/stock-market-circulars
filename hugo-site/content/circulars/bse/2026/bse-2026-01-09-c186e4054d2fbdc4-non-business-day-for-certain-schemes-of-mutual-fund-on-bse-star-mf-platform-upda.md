title: Non-Business Day for Certain Mutual Fund Schemes on BSE StAR MF Platform -
  January 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has announced non-business days for certain mutual fund schemes on the BSE StAR MF platform during January 2026. The affected schemes include international equity funds from Nippon India and ICICI Prudential, with specific non-business days scheduled on January 12 and 19, 2026.

## Key Points

- Nippon India Japan Equity Fund will observe a non-business day on January 12, 2026
- Nippon India US Equity Opportunities Fund will observe a non-business day on January 19, 2026
- ICICI Prudential Global Advantage Fund will observe a non-business day on January 12, 2026
- These are updates to the previously announced non-business day schedule
- Transactions for these schemes will not be processed on the specified dates

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational update regarding scheme-specific non-business days.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors should note that purchase and redemption requests for the affected schemes will not be processed on the specified non-business days
- Distributors and intermediaries should inform clients about these non-business days
- Alternative transaction dates should be planned accordingly

## Important Dates

- **January 12, 2026**: Non-business day for Nippon India Japan Equity Fund and ICICI Prudential Global Advantage Fund
- **January 19, 2026**: Non-business day for Nippon India US Equity Opportunities Fund

## Impact Assessment

The impact is minimal and limited to investors of the three specified international equity mutual fund schemes. The non-business days likely correspond to holidays in the underlying markets (Japan and US). Investors planning transactions in these schemes should schedule them before or after the non-business days. Other mutual fund schemes on the BSE StAR MF platform remain unaffected and will operate normally.
