  Code: 543525)'
---

## Summary

BSE has assigned a new ISIN number to Silver Touch Technologies Limited (Scrip Code: 543525) following the sub-division of its equity shares from a face value of Rs. 10 per share to Rs. 2 per share. This notice is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20260220-50 dated February 20, 2026. The new ISIN will be operative for all trades from the ex-date of March 6, 2026.

## Key Points

- New ISIN assigned: **INE625X01026**
- Company: Silver Touch Technologies Limited (BSE Scrip Code: 543525)
- Sub-division ratio: Equity shares sub-divided from face value Rs. 10/- to Rs. 2/- per share
- New ISIN is effective for trades on and from the ex-date: **March 6, 2026**
- Reference DR Number: 834/2025-2026
- Continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20260220-50 dated February 20, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This circular implements a corporate action (stock sub-division) already approved under DR-834/2025-2026. The change in ISIN reflects the creation of new equity shares of Rs. 2/- each replacing the old shares of Rs. 10/- each.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to use the new ISIN **INE625X01026** for Silver Touch Technologies Limited for all trades executed on or after the ex-date.
- Old ISIN references should be retired for trading purposes effective March 6, 2026.
- Members should ensure back-office and settlement systems reflect the new ISIN to avoid settlement failures.

## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Circular Date | February 27, 2026 |
| Reference Notice (20260220-50) | February 20, 2026 |
| Ex-Date (New ISIN effective) | March 6, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational update resulting from a share sub-division corporate action. The impact is primarily administrative — trading members and depository participants must update their systems with the new ISIN before the ex-date of March 6, 2026. Investors holding shares of Silver Touch Technologies will see their holdings automatically reflected in the new ISIN post the record date. The sub-division increases the number of shares proportionally (5x, from Rs. 10 to Rs. 2 face value) while keeping the total investment value unchanged, which may improve liquidity and affordability of the stock.
