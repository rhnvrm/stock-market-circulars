## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notice with minimal market impact. The allotment represents a small number of shares (56,000) issued through warrant conversion. The shares are subject to lock-in until July 31, 2026, which limits immediate trading activity. The preferential allotment to non-promoters indicates fundraising activity but the quantum is relatively modest.
