## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. Trading Members must comply with existing framework for Rights Entitlements trading as outlined in previous notices dated March 05, 2020 (notice no-20200305-21) and May 18, 2020 (notice no-20200518-34).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must inform all clients about the commencement of trading in REs, mentioning the ISIN (INE589D20018) and clarifying that REs are not ordinary shares
- Contract notes/bills containing purchase of REs must include a prominent disclaimer informing clients that:
  - Purchase of REs only gives the right to participate in the ongoing Rights Issue by making an application with requisite application money, or renounce the REs before issue closes
  - REs which are neither subscribed nor renounced on or before the Issue Closing Date shall lapse and be extinguished after the Issue Closing Date
- Trading Members must refer to notice no-20200305-21 dated March 05, 2020 and notice no-20200518-34 dated May 18, 2020 for additional details

## Important Dates

- **February 09, 2026 (Monday)**: Rights Entitlements trading for renunciation commences
- **February 09, 2026**: Rights Issue opens
- **February 12, 2026 (Thursday)**: Rights Entitlements trading for renunciation ends
- **February 17, 2026**: Rights Issue closes (Issue Closing Date)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Trading Members need to ensure their systems and processes are configured to handle Rights Entitlements trading in dematerialized form with T+1 settlement on a trade-for-trade basis.

**Client Communication**: Brokers must proactively communicate with shareholders of D & H INDIA LIMITED about the trading window for REs and ensure proper disclaimers are included in all transaction documents.

**Timeline Sensitivity**: The narrow 4-day trading window (February 09-12) for renunciation requires prompt action from shareholders who wish to renounce their rights entitlements. Failure to act by February 17, 2026 will result in lapse and extinguishment of unsubscribed/unrenounced REs.
