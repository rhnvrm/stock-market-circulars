- Market Lot: 1, Group: R
- REs tradable in dematerialized form only
- Settlement on T+1 rolling settlement basis
- Trade-for-trade settlement applicable
- REs that are neither subscribed nor renounced before issue closing date will lapse and be extinguished

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This circular implements existing rights issue renunciation trading procedures as established in previous BSE notices (20200305-21 dated March 5, 2020 and 20200518-34 dated May 18, 2020).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform all clients about commencement of trading in REs
- Must specify the ISIN of the RE to clients
- Must clarify that REs shall not be mistaken for ordinary shares
- Contract notes/bills containing purchase of REs must include prominent disclaimer informing clients that:

  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced before issue closing date will lapse and be extinguished
- Trading members should refer to notice 20200305-21 (March 5, 2020) and notice 20200518-34 (May 18, 2020) for further details

## Important Dates

- **January 30, 2026**: Notice date
- **February 2, 2026**: Rights issue opening date and RE trading commencement
- **February 2-5, 2026**: Trading period for renunciation of Rights Entitlements
- **February 11, 2026**: Rights issue closing date
- **After February 11, 2026**: Unsubscribed/unrenounced REs will lapse and be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal market-wide impact as this is a company-specific rights issue.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders of Galaxy Agrico Exports Limited have the opportunity to either subscribe to the rights issue, renounce their rights entitlements through market trading during the 4-day trading window (Feb 2-5), or let them lapse. The short renunciation window requires prompt decision-making.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure proper client communication, implement disclaimer requirements in contract notes, and facilitate dematerialized trading of REs with T+1 settlement. The trade-for-trade settlement basis eliminates netting, requiring specific attention to settlement obligations.
