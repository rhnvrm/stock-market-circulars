## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Limited direct market impact as only one security (PAE Ltd) is affected in this update. However, inclusion in IBC Stage 0 signals potential insolvency concerns.

**Operational Impact:** Investors holding PAE Ltd should monitor developments closely. The stock may face trading restrictions or enhanced surveillance measures. Market liquidity may be affected.

**Investor Considerations:** Securities under IBC framework carry elevated risk due to ongoing or potential insolvency proceedings. Investors should review their exposure to all companies listed in the consolidated annexure and assess portfolio risk accordingly.
