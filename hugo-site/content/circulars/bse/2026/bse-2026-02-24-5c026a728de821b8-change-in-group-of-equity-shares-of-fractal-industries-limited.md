## Impact Assessment

The transition from Trade for Trade (MT Group) to Rolling segment (M Group) is a positive development for market participants holding or trading Fractal Industries Limited shares. Trade for Trade segments restrict netting of positions and require compulsory delivery, which limits liquidity. Moving to the Rolling segment allows intraday trading, netting of positions, and normal settlement, thereby improving trading flexibility and potentially increasing participation in the scrip.
