## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The OFS involves 7,38,711 shares of East India Drums and Barrels Manufacturing Ltd, which will increase floating stock availability. The price priority allocation method ensures market-based price discovery.

**Investor Impact**: Retail investors benefit from 10% reservation and option to bid across multiple categories (RI/RIC/NII). Employees have higher bidding limit of Rs 5 lakhs versus Rs 2 lakhs for retail.

**Operational Impact**: Members need to ensure access to three different platforms (iBBS, RTRMS, Extranet) and manage different settlement cycles for different investor categories. Staggered bidding days (T and T+1) require careful coordination.
