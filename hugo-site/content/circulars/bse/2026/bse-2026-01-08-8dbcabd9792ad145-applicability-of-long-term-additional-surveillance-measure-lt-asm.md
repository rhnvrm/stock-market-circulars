title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has issued an update to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective January 09, 2026. Six securities are being newly shortlisted for LT-ASM, one security is being moved directly to Stage IV, and two securities are exiting the framework. The LT-ASM is a preventive surveillance measure applied to securities showing unusual price movements or excessive volatility.

## Key Points

- 6 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Palred Technologies Ltd, Rollatainers Ltd, Sattrix Information Security Ltd, Tahmar Enterprises Ltd, Varyaa Creations Ltd, and Viji Finance Ltd
- 1 security moved directly to Stage IV LT-ASM: Soma Papers & Industries Ltd
- 2 securities moving out of LT-ASM Framework: Arcee Industries Ltd and Goyal Aluminiums Ltd
- No securities are being moved to higher or lower ASM stages within the framework
- Changes take effect from January 09, 2026
- Consolidated list of all securities under various ASM stages is provided in Annexure III

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework is part of BSE's surveillance mechanism to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Securities under LT-ASM are subject to:

- Trading permitted only once a week (every Monday or next trading day)
- 100% margin requirement (no leverage)
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Price bands applicable as per regulations

The framework uses a stage-based approach (Stage I to Stage IV) with increasingly stringent measures. Securities can enter directly at Stage IV based on severity of concerns as referenced in notice no.20210604-41.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure 100% upfront margin collection for all LT-ASM securities
- Investors can only trade these securities on designated trading days (Mondays)
- Broker-dealers must update their risk management systems to reflect the new LT-ASM classifications
- Market participants should review positions in affected securities before the effective date
- Surveillance officers must monitor these securities for compliance with LT-ASM conditions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 09, 2026 - All LT-ASM changes become applicable
- **Trading Day**: Securities under LT-ASM can only be traded on Mondays (or next trading day if Monday is a holiday)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities entering LT-ASM will experience severely restricted liquidity with trading limited to once per week and 100% margin requirements. This typically results in wider bid-ask spreads and reduced trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: Existing investors in newly classified LT-ASM securities face limited exit opportunities and must plan trades around the weekly trading window. The 100% margin requirement prevents leveraged trading.

**Market Signal**: Inclusion in LT-ASM serves as a warning signal about potential price manipulation, excessive volatility, or other market integrity concerns. This often leads to further price pressure and investor caution.

**Exit Relief**: Two securities (Arcee Industries Ltd and Goyal Aluminiums Ltd) are being removed from LT-ASM, allowing normal trading to resume and improving liquidity for these stocks.

**Stage IV Classification**: Soma Papers & Industries Ltd being placed directly in Stage IV indicates serious surveillance concerns, representing the highest level of restrictions under the LT-ASM framework.
