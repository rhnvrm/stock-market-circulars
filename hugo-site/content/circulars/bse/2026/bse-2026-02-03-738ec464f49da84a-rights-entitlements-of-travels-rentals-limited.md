**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure proper client communication and include mandatory disclaimers in contract notes. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis requires appropriate operational setup.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders must be aware of the trading period and issue closing date to avoid lapsing of their rights entitlements. The 26-day trading window (Feb 05 - Mar 02) provides adequate time for renunciation decisions.
