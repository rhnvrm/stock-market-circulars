## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it announces a routine NFO launch on the BSE StAR MF Platform. The DSP Multi Asset Omni Fund of Funds provides investors with diversified multi-asset exposure through fund-of-funds structure. The operational impact is limited to BSE StAR MF Platform members who need to adhere to specific fund collection and settlement timelines. The extended midnight trading window for lumpsum purchases and strict fund availability deadlines require operational preparedness from participating members to ensure smooth allotment process.
