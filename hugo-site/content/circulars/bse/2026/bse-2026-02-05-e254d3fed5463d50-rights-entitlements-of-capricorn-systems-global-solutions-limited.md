- REs must be subscribed or renounced on or before Issue Closing Date to avoid lapsing

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects existing shareholders of Capricorn Systems Global Solutions Limited who hold Rights Entitlements. The 4-day trading window for renunciation provides liquidity for shareholders who do not wish to subscribe to the rights issue.

**Operational Impact**: Trading Members need to ensure proper client communication and include required disclaimers in contract notes. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis requires appropriate operational setup. Shareholders must be aware of the limited renunciation period and the consequences of not acting before the issue closing date.
