## Summary

BSE has issued the updated list of securities under the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective January 08, 2026. Six securities are newly shortlisted into LT-ASM, two securities continue in the framework but move to higher ASM stages (Stage II), and no securities are moving out of the framework. The circular includes a consolidated list showing all securities currently under various ASM stages.

## Key Points

- 6 new securities shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Captain Technocast Ltd, Chartered Logistics Ltd, Goyal Aluminiums Ltd, Gujarat Natural Resources Ltd, JD Cables Ltd, and Silver Touch Technologies Ltd
- 2 securities moving to higher Stage II ASM: Ikoma Technologies Ltd and Pro Clb Global Ltd
- No securities moving to lower ASM stages
- No securities entering Direct Stage IV
- No securities moving out of LT-ASM Framework
- Consolidated list includes securities across ASM Stages I, II, and IV
- Changes effective from January 08, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework continues BSE's surveillance mechanism to monitor securities with abnormal price movements or other concerns. Securities in this framework face enhanced trading restrictions including:

- Higher margin requirements
- Price bands
- Trade-to-trade settlement
- Additional disclosure requirements

Progressive stage movements (I to II to IV) indicate escalating surveillance measures based on continued concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable margin requirements for securities under LT-ASM
- Members must inform clients about securities under surveillance framework
- Enhanced due diligence required for orders in these securities
- Price band and trading restrictions must be observed
- Trade-to-trade settlement applies where specified

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** January 08, 2026 - All changes to LT-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Securities newly entering or moving to higher stages in LT-ASM framework will experience reduced liquidity due to stricter trading conditions. Investors holding these securities may face difficulty in executing large orders.

**Investor Impact:** Higher margin requirements and trade-to-trade settlement increase the cost of trading these securities. Retail investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence.

**Market Integrity:** The surveillance framework aims to protect investors from excessive speculation and price manipulation in vulnerable securities. Movement to higher stages indicates persistent concerns requiring stronger monitoring.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and trading members need to update their systems to reflect new ASM classifications and ensure appropriate margin collection and client communication.
