title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities Movement Updates
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective January 21, 2026. Two securities (AuSom Enterprise Ltd and Best Agrolife Ltd) have been newly shortlisted into ESM. One security (Bits Ltd) will be moved to a higher ESM stage. No securities are moving to lower ESM stages or exiting the framework. The circular includes a consolidated list of at least 30 securities currently under various ESM stages.

## Key Points

- 2 securities newly added to ESM framework: AuSom Enterprise Ltd (509009) and Best Agrolife Ltd (539660)
- 1 security moving to higher ESM stage: Bits Ltd (526709)
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages
- No securities exiting the ESM framework
- Consolidated list includes securities in ESM Stage I and Stage II
- Changes effective from January 21, 2026
- ESM framework involves enhanced monitoring and surveillance of securities

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) is a surveillance framework applied by BSE to securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or trading patterns. Securities under ESM are subject to:

- Trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday trading)
- 100% upfront margin requirements
- Progressive stages (Stage I, II, etc.) with increasing restrictions
- Regular review for movement between stages or exit from framework

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure 100% upfront margins for all trades in ESM securities
- All trades in ESM securities will be settled on a trade-for-trade basis
- No intraday trading or squaring off positions allowed
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance and restrictions on these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 21, 2026 - All ESM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 2 new securities and upgrade of 1 security to higher ESM stage indicates continued surveillance concerns. Traders in these securities will face restricted trading conditions.

**Liquidity Impact**: Securities under ESM typically experience reduced liquidity due to trade-for-trade requirements and margin obligations, making them less attractive for short-term trading.

**Investor Impact**: Existing and potential investors in the 30+ listed ESM securities should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence. The ESM classification indicates potential concerns regarding price volatility, corporate governance, or compliance issues.
