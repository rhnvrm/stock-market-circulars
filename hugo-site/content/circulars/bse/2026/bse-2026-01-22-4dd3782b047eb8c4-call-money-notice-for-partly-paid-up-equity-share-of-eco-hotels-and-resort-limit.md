## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market-wide impact as it pertains only to existing shareholders of Eco Hotels and Resort Limited holding partly paid-up equity shares. The call money collection process is a routine corporate action for companies with partly paid-up share structures. Shareholders must pay Rs. 3.80 per share during the specified period. The use of BSE's IBBS platform streamlines the collection process for authorized intermediaries. Non-compliance by shareholders may result in forfeiture of their partly paid-up shares as per standard call money procedures.
