## Summary

BSE has published the list of securities for Demat Auction No. 827, dated 25 February 2026. This auction covers scrips where delivery obligations were not met in the normal settlement cycle. Over 90 securities across multiple sectors are listed, with quantities ranging from 1 share to 170,025 shares (Alstone Textiles).

## Key Points

- Demat Auction No. 827 is scheduled for settlement on 25/02/2026
- Over 90 scrips are listed for auction spanning large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap segments
- Notable large-quantity auction lots include: ITC Ltd. (164,800 shares), Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (62,100 shares), Sawaca Enterprises (50,000 shares), Ashapura Minechem (8,500 shares), and Bajaj Finance (7,500 shares)
- Both NSE-listed blue-chip stocks and smaller BSE-listed scrips are included
- Auction participants can bid for these securities through the BSE auction mechanism

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational notice under BSE's standard auction process for handling short deliveries and non-deliveries in the equity settlement cycle.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members with short delivery positions in the listed scrips must participate or be covered through the auction
- Brokers/members with buying obligations for the listed securities will receive auction proceeds or securities as per BSE settlement procedures
- Settlement of auction trades will follow standard T+1 or applicable settlement norms

## Important Dates

- **Auction Date / Settlement Date:** 25 February 2026
- **Settlement Number:** 827

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine market operations notice. The large quantities of certain blue-chip stocks (ITC: 164,800 shares; Reliance Industries: 10,030 shares; Jio Financial Services: 11,750 shares; Sun Pharma: 5,793 shares) may indicate elevated short-delivery activity in these counters for the relevant settlement period. Participants with open obligations in the listed scrips should be aware of their auction settlement responsibilities. No broader market impact is anticipated beyond standard settlement resolution.
