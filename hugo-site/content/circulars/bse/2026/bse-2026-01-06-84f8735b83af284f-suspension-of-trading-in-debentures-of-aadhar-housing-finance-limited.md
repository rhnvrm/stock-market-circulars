## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and potential traders of this specific debenture series. The suspension is procedural and temporary, allowing the company to process the redemption and interest payment with a fixed list of eligible debenture holders. Investors holding these debentures will receive their redemption amount and interest payment as per the terms. No broader market impact is expected as this relates to a single debt instrument of one issuer.
