## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Existing Shareholders**: This mandatory open offer provides an exit opportunity for public shareholders of Premium Capital Market and Investments Limited to sell up to 26% of the company's equity at Rs. 6.40 per share. However, the offer price being significantly below face value (Rs. 6.40 vs Rs. 10) may indicate distressed valuation or poor market performance. Shareholders need to evaluate whether to tender their shares based on current market conditions and future prospects. Non-resident shareholders must ensure compliance with regulatory approvals to participate in the offer.
