title: MIRAE ASSET BSE INDIA DEFENCE ETF FOF Available for Ongoing Transactions on
  BSE StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

BSE has informed members that the MIRAE ASSET BSE INDIA DEFENCE ETF FOF, which was previously launched as an NFO, has been reopened for ongoing subscription and redemption. Starting February 24, 2026, the scheme will be available on the BSE StAR MF Platform with SIP, STP, and SWP facilities. This notice references the earlier Notice No. 20260130-26.

## Key Points

- MIRAE ASSET BSE INDIA DEFENCE ETF FOF is now available for ongoing transactions on BSE StAR MF Platform effective February 24, 2026.
- Both subscription and redemption are enabled, along with SIP (Systematic Investment Plan), STP (Systematic Transfer Plan), and SWP (Systematic Withdrawal Plan).
- Six scheme variants are available covering Regular and Direct plans with Growth, IDCW Payout, and IDCW Reinvestment options.
- This follows the earlier NFO notice dated January 30, 2026 (Notice No. 20260130-26).

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is an operational update transitioning the scheme from NFO to ongoing transaction mode on the BSE StAR MF Platform.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members and distributors on the BSE StAR MF Platform should update their systems to reflect the availability of all six scheme variants for ongoing transactions.
- Ensure correct ISIN mapping for each plan/option as listed below:
  - Regular Plan – Growth: INF769K01QD0
  - Regular Plan – IDCW Payout: INF769K01QF5
  - Regular Plan – IDCW Reinvestment: INF769K01QE8
  - Direct Plan – Growth: INF769K01QG3
  - Direct Plan – IDCW Payout: INF769K01QI9
  - Direct Plan – IDCW Reinvestment: INF769K01QH1

## Important Dates

- **February 24, 2026**: Effective date for ongoing subscription, redemption, SIP, STP, and SWP transactions on BSE StAR MF Platform.
- **January 30, 2026**: Original NFO notice date (Reference Notice No. 20260130-26).

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a moderate impact on mutual fund distributors and investors using the BSE StAR MF Platform. Investors who missed the NFO window now have access to the MIRAE ASSET BSE INDIA DEFENCE ETF FOF through regular ongoing transactions. The availability of SIP, STP, and SWP further broadens accessibility. The defence sector theme may attract investor interest given ongoing government focus on defence indigenisation. No market-wide or compliance-heavy impact is expected.
