## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. These are standard surveillance procedures where exchanges seek clarifications on unusual trading patterns. The responses confirm no underlying corporate developments driving the price/volume changes, indicating movements were speculative or liquidity-driven rather than fundamentals-based. Investors should note that exchange surveillance actively monitors unusual activity and requires company clarifications to ensure market integrity.
