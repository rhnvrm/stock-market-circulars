## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing announcement with minimal market impact. The issuance represents a small number of shares (65,000) allotted exclusively to promoters through warrant conversion at a premium of Rs. 202/- per share. The shares are subject to a standard lock-in period until July 2027, preventing immediate selling pressure. The preferential allotment to promoters may indicate promoter confidence and commitment to the company. Market impact is expected to be negligible given the small size and promoter-only allotment with lock-in restrictions.
