- Aarti Pharmalabs Limited confirmed timely dissemination of all required information to stock exchanges
- No pending announcements or undisclosed information that may affect price or volume behavior
- All companies stated that volume/price movements are absolutely market driven and not due to any undisclosed material events
- AI Champdany Industries Limited response was included but content was truncated in the source document

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies are required to respond to BSE Surveillance queries regarding unusual price/volume movements
- Companies must confirm compliance with Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015
- Companies must disclose if there is any undisclosed material information that could impact price/volume behavior

## Important Dates

- January 12, 2026: Date of clarifications from companies
- January 12, 2026: Date of BSE Surveillance queries (Ref No. L/SURV/ONL/PV/APJ/2025-2026/862 for Yasho Industries and Ref No. L/SURV/ONL/PV/APJ/2025-2026/859 for Aarti Pharmalabs)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. These are routine surveillance clarifications confirming that companies have complied with disclosure norms and that recent price/volume movements are market driven rather than due to undisclosed material events. Investors should note that BSE actively monitors unusual trading patterns and seeks timely clarifications from listed entities. The responses provide transparency but do not indicate any new material information or corporate actions.
