## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of approximately 12.1 million new shares represents significant equity dilution. However, the staggered lock-in periods (until July 2026 and July 2027) will limit immediate selling pressure, with 87.96% of shares locked until 2027.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will experience dilution from this preferential allotment. The lock-in provisions provide some protection against immediate market overhang.

**Liquidity Impact**: Medium-term liquidity may be enhanced once lock-in periods expire, though immediate impact is minimal due to lock-in restrictions on the majority of newly issued shares.
