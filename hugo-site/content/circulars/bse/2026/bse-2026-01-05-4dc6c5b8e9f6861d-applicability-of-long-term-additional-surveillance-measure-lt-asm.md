## Summary

BSE has updated the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective January 06, 2026. One security (Panther Industrial Products Ltd) has been newly shortlisted under LT-ASM, while two securities (Vision Cinemas Ltd and ANS Industries Ltd) are moving out of the framework due to inclusion in other surveillance measures (ESM and GSM respectively).

## Key Points

- Panther Industrial Products Ltd (Scrip Code: 524055, ISIN: INE181D01014) newly added to LT-ASM Framework
- Vision Cinemas Ltd moving out due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- ANS Industries Ltd moving out due to inclusion in GSM Framework
- No securities moved to higher or lower ASM stages
- No securities shortlisted for direct Stage IV under LT-ASM
- Consolidated list includes 16+ securities across various ASM stages

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework continues to operate as a surveillance mechanism for securities exhibiting certain risk characteristics. Securities in this framework are subject to enhanced monitoring and trading restrictions to protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note the inclusion of Panther Industrial Products Ltd in LT-ASM from January 06, 2026
- Trading members must comply with applicable ASM stage restrictions for affected securities
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance applicable to these securities
- Special margin and delivery requirements apply to LT-ASM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 06, 2026 - Changes to LT-ASM Framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited as only one security is being added to the LT-ASM framework. The two securities moving out (Vision Cinemas and ANS Industries) continue under other surveillance frameworks (ESM and GSM), maintaining regulatory oversight. Market participants trading in Panther Industrial Products Ltd will need to comply with LT-ASM requirements including higher margins and compulsory delivery. The consolidated list demonstrates BSE's ongoing efforts to monitor securities with potential price manipulation or volatility concerns.
