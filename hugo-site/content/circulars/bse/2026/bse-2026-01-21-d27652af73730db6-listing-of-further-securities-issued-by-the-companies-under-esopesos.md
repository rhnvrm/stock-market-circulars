## Summary

BSE has listed 3,199 additional securities issued by companies under their Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) or Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOS). The shares are being listed in three tranches with different lock-in conditions, with some shares having immediate trading availability while others are subject to lock-in periods.

## Key Points

- Total of 3,199 shares being listed under ESOP/ESOS
- Three separate tranches of shares: 1,660 shares, 947 shares, and 592 shares
- Share range from 20757847 to 20761045
- Two tranches (947 and 592 shares) have lock-in periods
- One tranche (1,660 shares) has no lock-in restrictions

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must ensure lock-in compliance for the specified share ranges
- Shares in ranges 20759507-20760453 and 20760454-20761045 are subject to lock-in from January 15, 2026
- Lock-in periods differ: one tranche until February 2, 2026 and another until February 2, 2027

## Important Dates

- **January 15, 2026**: Lock-in period starts for 1,539 shares (947 + 592)
- **February 2, 2026**: Lock-in period ends for 947 shares (range 20759507-20760453)
- **February 2, 2027**: Lock-in period ends for 592 shares (range 20760454-20761045)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative listing with minimal market impact. The total number of shares being listed (3,199) is relatively small. The staggered lock-in periods ensure controlled release of ESOP shares into the market, preventing sudden supply increases. Only 1,660 shares are immediately available for trading, while the remaining 1,539 shares will be released gradually over the next year.
