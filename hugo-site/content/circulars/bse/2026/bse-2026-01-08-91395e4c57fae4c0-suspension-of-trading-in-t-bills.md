## Summary

BSE has issued a notice suspending trading in two Treasury Bills (T-Bills) effective January 9, 2026. The suspension applies to scrip codes 810582 (827GUJ2026) and 810595 (829AP2026), which are set to mature on their respective redemption dates. Trading members are advised not to deal with these T-Bills from the effective date.

## Key Points

- Two T-Bills to be suspended from trading: 827GUJ2026 (ISIN: IN1520150104) and 829AP2026 (ISIN: IN1020150117)
- Scrip codes affected: 810582 and 810595
- Suspension effective from January 9, 2026
- Reason: Approaching maturity/redemption date
- Notice reference: DR-795/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard operational procedure for T-Bills approaching maturity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all trading activities in the specified T-Bills from January 9, 2026
- Members should update their systems to prevent inadvertent trades in these instruments
- Existing positions should be managed with awareness of the impending maturity

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 8, 2026
- **Trading Suspension Effective Date**: January 9, 2026
- **Maturity/Redemption Date**: On or around January 9, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine suspension affecting only two specific T-Bill instruments approaching maturity. Such suspensions are standard practice in debt markets to prevent trading close to redemption.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - Trading members dealing in these specific T-Bills need to ensure no trades are executed from January 9, 2026. Investors holding these instruments will receive redemption proceeds as per normal maturity procedures.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to holders of these specific T-Bills who will receive their principal at maturity rather than having the option to trade.
