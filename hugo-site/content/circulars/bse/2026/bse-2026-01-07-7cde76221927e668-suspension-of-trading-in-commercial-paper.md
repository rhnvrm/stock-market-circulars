**Investor Impact:** Investors holding these commercial papers will receive redemption proceeds as per the scheduled dates. No trading activity possible from the no-dealings dates.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their systems to block trading in these 17 commercial paper ISINs from their respective suspension dates. Standard corporate action processing required for redemption settlements.
