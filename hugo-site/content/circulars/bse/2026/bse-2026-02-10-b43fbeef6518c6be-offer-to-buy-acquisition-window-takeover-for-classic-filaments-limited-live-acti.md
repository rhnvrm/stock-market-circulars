## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a company-specific takeover offer for Classic Filaments Limited, a small-cap stock. The offer size of approximately 15.89 lakh shares at Rs. 12.00 per share represents a modest transaction value of around Rs. 1.91 crore.

**Operational Impact**: Medium for participating members. Trading members and custodians handling CFL shareholders need to ensure proper UCC registration, platform access, and adherence to session timings. Members must coordinate with investors holding CFL shares in demat form.

**Investor Impact**: Relevant only for existing CFL shareholders who may tender their shares during the 15-day offer window. The offer price of Rs. 12.00 per share (20% premium to face value of Rs. 10.00) provides an exit opportunity for shareholders.
