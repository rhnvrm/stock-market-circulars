  23, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has notified trading members about the non-competitive bidding facility for the upcoming auction of three Government of India dated securities (G-secs) scheduled for January 23, 2026. The auction, conducted by RBI, will offer three securities with a combined issue size of Rs. 33,000 crores. Members and direct investors can submit bids through BSE's iBBS web-based NCB-GSec module with specific timelines for bid collection.

## Key Points

- Three GoI dated securities will be auctioned: New GS 2029 (Rs. 9,000 cr re-issue), New GS 2033 (Rs. 11,000 cr re-issue), and 7.24% GS 2055 (Rs. 13,000 cr re-issue)
- Bidding platform: BSE's iBBS web-based system NCB-GSec module (https://ibbs.bseindia.com)
- Minimum subscription: 100 units with Rs. 10,000 minimum amount
- Maximum bidding limit: Rs. 2 crores per security
- All three securities are re-issues of existing G-secs
- Settlement to occur on T+4 basis (January 27, 2026)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular continues the existing non-competitive bidding facility launched via Exchange circular no. 20180423-42 dated April 23, 2018.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the designated NCB-GSec module on iBBS platform for bid submission

- Bidding amount must be between Rs. 10,000 (minimum) and Rs. 2 crores (maximum) per security
- Members must submit bids before the specified deadlines based on participant type
- Pay-in obligations must be fulfilled as per ICCL requirements

## Important Dates

- **January 19, 2026**: RBI press release announcing the auction
- **January 20, 2026, 10:00 AM**: Bid collection starts (24-hour availability)
- **January 22, 2026, 5:00 PM**: Bid collection ends for direct investors

- **January 23, 2026**: Auction date
- **January 27, 2026**: Settlement date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The total issue size of Rs. 33,000 crores represents significant government borrowing and will add liquidity to the debt market. The inclusion of long-tenure securities (up to 2055) provides investment options across the yield curve.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and direct investors need to prepare bid submissions within tight timelines. The non-competitive bidding facility simplifies participation for retail and smaller institutional investors who may not have the infrastructure for competitive bidding.

**Investor Impact**: Maximum cap of Rs. 2 crores per security ensures broad participation while preventing concentration. The re-issue nature of all three securities provides liquidity enhancement for existing G-sec holders.
