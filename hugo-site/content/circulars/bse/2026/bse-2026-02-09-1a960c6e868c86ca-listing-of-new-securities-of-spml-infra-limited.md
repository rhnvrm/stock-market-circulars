## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notice for preferential allotment to promoters. The shares are subject to lock-in until August 30, 2027, meaning they cannot be traded by the promoters until that date. The impact on market operations is minimal as this is a standard corporate action. The increase in share capital strengthens the company's equity base.
