## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing announcement with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment of 1 million shares represents a capital infusion for Tarmat Limited through warrant conversion. The lock-in period until July 30, 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure. Impact is limited to existing shareholders of Tarmat Limited, with no broader market implications. The shares being issued to non-promoters at a premium indicates investor confidence in the company.
