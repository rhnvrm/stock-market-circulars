## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine listing event for preferential allotment shares. The issue size is relatively small (10.76 lakh shares) and all shares are under lock-in, preventing immediate trading impact.

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal immediate impact as promoter shares are locked for approximately 18 months and non-promoter shares for 6 months from the circular date.

**Investor Impact:** Limited - Existing shareholders should note the equity dilution, though the preferential issue was completed in 2025. The lock-in periods provide stability by preventing immediate selling pressure.
