## Summary

BSE has announced updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective January 19, 2026. Seven securities are being newly included in the ST-ASM framework, six securities are exiting the framework, and one security (Padam Cotton Yarns Ltd) is being moved to a lower stage within the framework. The ST-ASM is a surveillance mechanism applied to securities showing abnormal price movements or volatility.

- Framework includes SME scrips (marked with @) and securities based on NSE criteria (marked with *)
- Changes effective from January 19, 2026

## Securities Moving to Lower Stage

- Padam Cotton Yarns Ltd (531395, INE448D01025) - Moving to lower stage within ST-ASM framework

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies additional surveillance measures including potential price bands, trade-for-trade settlement, or other restrictions to securities exhibiting unusual price movements. Securities can be placed in different stages (I, II, III) with progressively stricter measures. The framework aims to protect investor interests and maintain market integrity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform clients about securities under ST-ASM framework
- Enhanced disclosure requirements may apply for transactions in these securities
- Clients should be made aware of applicable price bands and trading restrictions
- Settlement may be on a trade-for-trade basis depending on the stage

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 19, 2026 - All changes to ST-ASM framework take effect

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of securities in ST-ASM typically results in reduced liquidity, wider bid-ask spreads, and increased volatility as trading restrictions are applied. For the 7 newly added securities, investors may face stricter trading conditions. The 6 securities exiting the framework will see relaxation of surveillance measures, potentially improving liquidity. SME scrips marked with @ may experience more significant impact due to their already limited liquidity. The movement of Padam Cotton Yarns to a lower stage indicates improved trading behavior and reduced surveillance concerns.
