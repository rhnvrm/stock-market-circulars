## Impact Assessment

This OFS has limited market-wide impact as it is specific to AANCHAL ISPAT LTD. The offering size of 5.66 lakh shares at a floor price of Rs 50 represents a relatively small transaction. Impact is primarily on investors interested in this specific security. The structured bidding process with separate days for institutional and retail investors ensures orderly price discovery.
