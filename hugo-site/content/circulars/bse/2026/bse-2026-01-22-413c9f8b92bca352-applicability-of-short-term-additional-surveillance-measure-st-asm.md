## Summary

BSE has updated the list of securities under the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective January 23, 2026. One new security (Neopolitan Pizza And Foods Ltd) has been added to the ST-ASM framework, six securities are moving out of the framework, and one security (Vivimed Labs Ltd) is being moved to a lower stage within the framework. The circular provides a consolidated list of all securities currently under ST-ASM with their respective stages.

## Key Points

- 1 security newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework: Neopolitan Pizza And Foods Ltd (SME scrip)
- 1 security moved to lower stage ASM: Vivimed Labs Ltd
- 6 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework: Adcounty Media India Ltd, Dipna Pharmachem Ltd, Glittek Granites Ltd, Luxury Time Ltd, Mukat Pipes Ltd, and Uniroyal Marine Exports Ltd
- Consolidated list shows 18+ securities currently under ST-ASM Stage I surveillance
- Framework includes special markings for SME scrips (@) and T+0 scrips (~)

## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework continues BSE's enhanced monitoring of securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or trading patterns. Securities in this framework are subject to additional margins and trading restrictions based on their stage assignment (5/15/30 days). The framework works in coordination with other surveillance measures including LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge Framework, and ESM.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of securities entering or exiting ST-ASM framework
- Enhanced margin requirements apply to securities under ST-ASM
- Trading members should ensure compliance with stage-specific trading restrictions
- Investors should note the increased surveillance and potential liquidity constraints for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 23, 2026 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The addition of Neopolitan Pizza And Foods Ltd to ST-ASM indicates heightened surveillance due to price/volume volatility concerns. The exit of 6 securities suggests either improved price stability or migration to other surveillance frameworks. Vivimed Labs Ltd moving to a lower stage indicates reduced surveillance concerns. Market participants trading these securities will experience modified margin requirements and potential liquidity impacts. The overall impact is moderate, affecting specific stocks rather than broader market operations.
