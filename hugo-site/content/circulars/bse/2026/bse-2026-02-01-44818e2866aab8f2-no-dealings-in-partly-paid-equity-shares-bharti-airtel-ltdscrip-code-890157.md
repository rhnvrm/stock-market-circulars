## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of partly paid equity shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd. Regular equity shares trading remains unaffected.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block transactions in scrip code 890157. Shareholders of partly paid shares need to prepare for call money payment of Rs.401.25 per share to convert to fully paid shares.
