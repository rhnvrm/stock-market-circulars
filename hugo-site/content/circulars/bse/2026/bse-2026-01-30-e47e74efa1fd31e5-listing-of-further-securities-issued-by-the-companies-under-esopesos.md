## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard listing notification for shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note the new shares available for trading
- Updated share capital information should be reflected in trading systems
- No specific compliance actions required from market participants beyond normal listing procedures

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 30, 2026
- **Trading Commencement**: February 1, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (NA for all companies)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing represents routine administrative activity for shares issued under employee compensation schemes. The quantum of shares (1.78 million total) is relatively small compared to the outstanding shares of these companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minor increase in free float for each company. The largest addition is IDFC First Bank Limited with 1,091,052 shares (10.91 lakh shares).

**Shareholder Impact**: Dilution effect is negligible given the small percentage these shares represent relative to total outstanding shares for these large-cap and mid-cap companies.

**Trading Considerations**: No lock-in restrictions apply, meaning these shares can be traded immediately upon listing, though typical ESOP vesting schedules may still apply at the employee level.
