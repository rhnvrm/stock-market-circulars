## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects 170+ securities but with relatively small quantities for most stocks. Only a few securities have significant auction quantities (e.g., Vodafone Idea, PNB, ABFRL).

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members with shortfall positions in these securities will need to participate in the auction. May result in price volatility for securities with larger auction quantities during the settlement window.

**Investor Impact**: Low to Medium - Primarily affects brokers and institutional investors with pending delivery obligations. Retail investors are indirectly affected if their brokers have settlement obligations.

**Financial Impact**: Auction prices typically carry a penalty component, resulting in higher costs for members with delivery failures. The magnitude depends on market prices and auction premiums applied.
