title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Lower Revision of Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular announcing the downward revision of Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages for 56 securities. These securities are being moved to lower surveillance stages, indicating improved compliance metrics or reduced regulatory concerns. The revisions span multiple groups (XT, Z, X, TS, T, B, P) and involve stage reductions across all levels from Stage 4 to Stage 0.

## Key Points

- 56 securities have been moved to lower GSM stages
- Stage reductions range from Stage 4→3, Stage 3→2, Stage 2→1, and Stage 1→0
- Most affected securities are in the XT group (26 securities)
- Securities in Z, X, B, T, TS, and P groups are also included
- Lower stages indicate reduced surveillance requirements and improved market standing
- This reflects positive developments in terms of compliance and trading parameters

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework continues to operate with its multi-stage surveillance approach. This circular represents a positive adjustment where securities have met criteria for downward revision. The stage reductions suggest:

- Improved price stability
- Better compliance with disclosure requirements
- Enhanced trading volumes or reduced volatility concerns
- Meeting BSE's criteria for lower surveillance levels

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies must continue to maintain compliance standards that led to stage reduction
- Trading members should note the revised surveillance stages for these securities
- Companies should ensure continued adherence to listing obligations to avoid re-escalation
- Market participants should be aware of the revised stage classifications when trading these securities

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: February 6, 2026
- Effective Date: Immediate (as per circular publication)

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact:**
- Reduced surveillance burden on affected companies
- Potential for increased liquidity as lower stages typically have fewer trading restrictions
- Improved market perception for these securities
- Lower compliance costs and operational requirements

**Market Implications:**
- Investors may view stage reductions positively as indicators of improved fundamentals
- Trading activity may increase in these securities with relaxed surveillance measures
- Companies demonstrate ability to meet regulatory standards and improve market standing

**Affected Securities Distribution:**
