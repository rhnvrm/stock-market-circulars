---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for 23 securities effective from January 8, 2026. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20%, replacing their existing levels. This circular issued by BSE Surveillance department modifies the maximum permissible intraday price movement for the listed securities.

## Regulatory Changes

Price band modifications represent surveillance measures to control excessive volatility in specific securities. Tighter price bands (2%) indicate heightened regulatory oversight, while wider bands (10-20%) may reflect higher liquidity or different risk profiles.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement the revised price bands from market opening on January 8, 2026
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect new price limits
- Orders exceeding the revised price bands will be rejected
- Members should communicate these changes to their clients trading in affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 7, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 8, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Traders in the 23 affected securities will face modified intraday trading ranges. Securities with tighter 2% bands will have limited price discovery and reduced speculation opportunities. Securities with 10-20% bands will allow more volatility.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update risk management systems and margin requirements based on new price bands. Algorithmic trading strategies may need recalibration for these securities.

**Investor Impact**: Investors should be aware that pending limit orders outside the new price bands will not execute. Tighter price bands may reduce liquidity and widen bid-ask spreads.
