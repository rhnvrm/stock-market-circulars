## Impact Assessment

- **Debt investors**: NCD and commercial paper holders across multiple issuers should monitor upcoming record dates to ensure eligibility for interest payments and redemptions. The cancellation of ECap Equities' NCD interest payment warrants attention from affected bondholders.
- **Equity investors**: ANNVRRIDHHI VENTURES LIMITED shareholders face an imminent call payment deadline (27/02/2026), and HealthCare Global Enterprises shareholders must act ahead of the rights issue record date (02/03/2026).
- **Kosamattam Finance**: Multiple NCD series have staggered payment schedules across April–June 2026, indicating ongoing debt servicing obligations across different tranches.
- Overall market impact is low as these are routine corporate actions; individual security holders are most directly affected.
