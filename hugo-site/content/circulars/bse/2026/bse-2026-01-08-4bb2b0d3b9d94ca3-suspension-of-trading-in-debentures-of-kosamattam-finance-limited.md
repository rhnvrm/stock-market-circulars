---

## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in two series of non-convertible debentures issued by Kosamattam Finance Limited, effective January 15, 2026. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these specified debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies to two debenture series: INE403Q08134 (Code: 936448) and INE403Q08142 (Code: 936450)
- Record date set for January 15, 2026
- Purpose includes both redemption of debentures and payment of interest for INE403Q08134
- Purpose includes only redemption of debentures for INE403Q08142
- Trading members instructed to cease dealing from January 15, 2026
- Circular reference: DR-799/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard operational suspension due to corporate action (record date fixation for debenture redemption and interest payment).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures (INE403Q08134 and INE403Q08142) from January 15, 2026
- Members must take note of the suspension and inform clients holding these debentures
- No dealings permitted in these securities from the specified date

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: January 8, 2026 (Notice No. 20260108-16)
- **Record Date**: January 15, 2026
- **No Dealings From**: January 15, 2026
- **Notice Signed**: January 6, 2025 (by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance and Operations)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of specific Kosamattam Finance Limited debentures. The suspension prevents secondary market trading but is part of normal corporate action process for debt redemption.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders cannot sell their holdings in the secondary market from January 15, 2026, but will receive scheduled interest payments and redemption proceeds as per the record date.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trades in these two ISINs and communicate the suspension to affected clients.
