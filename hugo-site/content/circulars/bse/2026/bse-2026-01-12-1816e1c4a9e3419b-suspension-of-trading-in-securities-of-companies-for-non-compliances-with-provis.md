- Post-suspension, trade-for-trade basis trading in Z group allowed only on first trading day of every week for six months

## Important Dates

- **January 12, 2026**: Notice issued
- **February 09, 2026**: Last date for companies to comply and avoid suspension
- **February 12, 2026**: Trading suspension becomes effective
- **15 days after suspension**: Trade-for-trade trading begins (first trading day of every week only)
- **Six months**: Duration of trade-for-trade period in Z group

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact (High):**
- Complete halt in normal trading for existing shareholders
- Severe liquidity constraints - investors cannot exit positions easily
- Limited trading opportunity (only one day per week on trade-for-trade basis)
- Price discovery severely impaired during suspension period
- Potential for significant price decline when trading resumes

**Company Impact (High):**
- Reputational damage from regulatory non-compliance
- Frozen promoter holdings restricts promoter flexibility
- Difficulty in raising capital during suspension
- Additional compliance costs and fine payments required
- Potential for further regulatory scrutiny

**Market Impact (Medium):**
- Notable inclusion of Rajesh Exports Ltd (major jewelry exporter)
- Future Consumer Ltd associated with Future Group companies
- Limited overall market impact given relatively small market capitalization of affected companies
- Sets precedent for strict enforcement of shareholding pattern disclosure norms

## Post-Suspension Trading Rules

- After 15 days of suspension, restricted trading allowed
- Trade-for-trade basis only (no intraday trading)
- Z group classification (highest risk category)
- Trading permitted only on first trading day of each week
- Limited trading window continues for six months
- Normal trading resumes only after full compliance and revocation approval
