The shares carry an ISIN of IN9638N01028 with no lock-in period applicable.

## Key Points

- Total partly paid-up shares originally issued (as on September 26, 2025): 1,28,76,808
- Partly paid shares on which first call money has been received: 88,68,167
- Shares eligible and available for trading on resumption: 88,54,060
- First call money received: Rs. 3.80 per share (Rs. 2.50 face value + Rs. 1.30 premium)
- ISIN for tradable partly paid shares: IN9638N01028
- No lock-in period applicable
- Distinctive number ranges: NSDL – 51751136 to 55346877 (35,95,742 shares); CDSL – 55352250 to 60610567 (52,58,318 shares)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational notice enabling trading resumption for partly paid-up shares following receipt of call money.

## Compliance Requirements

- BSE Listing Operations to enable trading for the specified 88,54,060 partly paid-up equity shares under ISIN IN9638N01028.
- Depositories (NSDL and CDSL) to activate trading for the respective distinctive number ranges.

## Important Dates

- Partly paid shares originally issued: September 26, 2025
- Application for trading resumption filed: February 23, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The resumption affects 88,54,060 partly paid-up equity shares, representing approximately 68.7% of the total 1,28,76,808 partly paid shares issued. The balance ~22,200 partly paid shares (difference between 88,68,167 received call money and 88,54,060 approved for trading) are excluded, likely due to pending demat or procedural reasons. This is a routine corporate action with limited broader market impact, relevant primarily to existing holders of these partly paid instruments.
