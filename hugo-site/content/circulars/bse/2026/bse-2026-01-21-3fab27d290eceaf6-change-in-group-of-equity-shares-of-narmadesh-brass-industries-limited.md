## Summary

This change follows the exchange's earlier notice dated January 20, 2026.

## Key Points

- Company: Narmadesh Brass Industries Limited (SME IPO)
- Scrip Code: 544680
- Current Group: MT Group (Trade for Trade segment)
- New Group: M Group (Rolling segment)
- Effective Date: Wednesday, February 04, 2026

- Contact: Mr. Nitinkumar Pujari, Tel: 022-2272 8398

## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for Narmadesh Brass Industries Limited shares is being upgraded from Trade for Trade settlement to Rolling settlement. This represents a transition from the more restrictive MT Group to the standard M Group trading framework, which typically occurs after an SME IPO stabilizes in the market.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must note the segment change and adjust their systems accordingly
- All trades post February 04, 2026 will be under Rolling settlement mechanism
- Trading Members requiring clarification should contact the designated BSE official

## Important Dates

- **January 20, 2026**: Initial notice issued (Notice No. 20260120-48)
- **January 21, 2026**: Confirmation notice issued
- **February 04, 2026**: Effective date for group change from MT to M Group

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The shift from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment is generally positive for liquidity as it removes the requirement for immediate delivery and payment. Investors will benefit from standard T+2 settlement cycles.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new group classification. The change enables more flexible trading strategies including intraday positions, which were not possible under the Trade for Trade framework.

**Liquidity Impact**: Expected to improve trading volumes and market depth as the stock moves to a more liquid trading segment with standard settlement mechanisms.
