## Impact Assessment

This demat auction affects 87 scrips with varying quantities. The impact is primarily operational, affecting brokers and clearing members who have failed to deliver securities. The auction mechanism ensures settlement completion and market integrity. Large quantities in specific scrips like Sunshine Capital (1.08 million shares), India Homes (29,640 shares), and SUBEX (25,000 shares) may see temporary price volatility during the auction process. For most scrips, the quantities are relatively small and unlikely to cause significant market disruption. This is a standard market operation mechanism to ensure clearing and settlement efficiency.
