title: Add-on Price Band Framework - Updated List of 38 Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has published an updated list of securities subject to the Add-on Price Band Framework. This surveillance measure applies to 38 scrips and is designed to control excessive price volatility by imposing additional price band restrictions on these securities during trading.

## Key Points

- Total of 38 securities included in the Add-on Price Band framework
- Securities span across various sectors including engineering, infrastructure, finance, manufacturing, and technology
- List includes both established companies and smaller entities
- Framework applies surveillance measures to prevent unusual price movements
- Companies range from wellness products to industrial manufacturing

## Regulatory Changes

This is an updated list under the existing Add-on Price Band Framework. The framework itself is a surveillance mechanism that BSE uses to impose stricter price band limits on securities that may exhibit unusual trading patterns or require additional oversight.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of applicable price bands for these securities
- Orders for these scrips will be subject to add-on price band restrictions
- Market participants should check current price band limits before placing orders
- These securities may have different intraday price movement limits compared to regular securities

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: January 1, 2026
- Effective immediately upon publication

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects trading dynamics of 38 securities with potential for reduced liquidity and constrained price discovery during high volatility periods.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities will face additional restrictions on order placement and execution, potentially limiting ability to enter or exit positions during volatile market conditions.

**Trading Impact:** Orders exceeding the add-on price band limits may be rejected or subject to additional checks, requiring traders to adjust their order strategies for these securities.
