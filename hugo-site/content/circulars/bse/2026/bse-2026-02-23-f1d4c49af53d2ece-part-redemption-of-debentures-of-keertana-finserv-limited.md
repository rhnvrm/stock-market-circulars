|---|---|
| Notice Date | 23 February 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

Impact is limited to holders and traders of the specific NCD series KFL-11.4%-23-6-28-PVT issued by Keertana Finserv Limited. This is a privately placed instrument with a narrow investor base. The reduction in face value reflects a partial principal repayment, which is a routine event for amortising debentures. Broader market impact is negligible.
