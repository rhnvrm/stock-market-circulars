- Effective Date: February 20, 2026
- Old ISIN (INE150C01011) for Rs.10/- shares will become invalid for exchange transactions from February 20, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date of February 20, 2026
- The existing ISIN No. INE150C01011 (Rs.10/- paid-up) will not be valid for transactions on or after February 20, 2026
- Market participants must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN once notified
- Demat accounts will be automatically credited with subdivided shares

## Important Dates

- **January 21, 2026**: Notice issued by BSE
- **February 20, 2026**: Record date for sub-division
- **February 20, 2026**: Effective date - new Rs.2/- shares become valid for trading
- **February 20, 2026**: Old ISIN (INE150C01011) becomes invalid for exchange transactions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The sub-division will reduce the per-share price of Titan Biotech to one-fifth of the current price, potentially improving liquidity and making shares more accessible to retail investors. Outstanding shares will increase five-fold while market capitalization remains unchanged.

**Operational Impact**: Shareholders will automatically receive four additional shares for every one share held as of the record date. This affects portfolio accounting, holding statements, and all share-related calculations. The ISIN change requires system updates across depositories, trading platforms, and custodian systems.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders face no dilution - their proportionate ownership remains unchanged. However, they must track the ISIN change and verify correct credit of subdivided shares in their demat accounts post-record date.
