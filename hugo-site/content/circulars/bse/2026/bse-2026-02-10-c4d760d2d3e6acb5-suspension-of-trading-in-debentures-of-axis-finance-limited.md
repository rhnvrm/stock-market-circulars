## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of AXIS FINANCE LIMITED effective February 12, 2026. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies to AXIS FINANCE LIMITED debentures with ISIN INE891K07945 (Code: 975448)
- Debenture series: AFL-8.35%-27-2-26-PVT (8.35% coupon rate)
- Record date set for February 12, 2026
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- No dealings permitted from February 12, 2026 onwards
- Circular reference: DR-819/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action notification for debenture redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all trading activities in the specified AXIS FINANCE LIMITED debentures from February 12, 2026
- Members must ensure client positions are settled before the no-dealings date
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the trading suspension
- Compliance with record date requirements for interest payment and redemption processing

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 10, 2026
- **Record Date**: February 12, 2026
- **No Dealings From**: February 12, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The trading suspension affects holders of AXIS FINANCE LIMITED's 8.35% NCDs maturing on February 27, 2026. Impact is localized to this specific debt instrument. Debenture holders on record as of February 12, 2026 will receive the final interest payment and redemption proceeds. Trading members with open positions must settle before the suspension date. This is a routine corporate action with minimal broader market impact, as it relates to a single maturing debenture series of a private placement.
