## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Limited impact on overall market operations. The suspensions are temporary and related to scheduled redemptions of commercial papers. Debt market participants holding these specific instruments will need to process redemptions.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure their systems reflect the trading suspension to prevent inadvertent trades. Investors holding these commercial papers will receive redemption proceeds as per the scheduled redemption dates.

**Investor Impact:** Holders of these commercial papers will have their investments redeemed on the scheduled dates. No trading activity will be possible from the suspension dates onwards, which is standard procedure for maturing debt instruments.
