## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and traders of these two specific commercial paper instruments in the BSE Debt segment. Both instruments are approaching maturity and redemption, so the suspension is a routine administrative action. Investors holding these commercial papers should note that secondary market trading will not be available on or after the respective no-dealings dates and should plan accordingly. No broader market impact is anticipated.
