## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The suspension affects commercial paper trading for multiple major issuers but is temporary and specific to maturing instruments. Market liquidity in these specific CPs will be restricted during the suspension period.

**Operational Impact:** Low to Medium - Trading members need to ensure compliance with suspension dates and manage client positions accordingly. Standard operational procedure for debt market participants.

**Investor Impact:** Low - Investors holding these commercial papers will receive redemption proceeds as scheduled. The suspension is procedural and protects investor interests by preventing trades that would settle after the record date.

**Sector Coverage:** Diversified - Affected issuers span financial services (Bajaj Group entities, Axis Finance, ICICI Securities, Navi Finserv), infrastructure (Adani Enterprises, Tata Power), and specialized finance companies.
