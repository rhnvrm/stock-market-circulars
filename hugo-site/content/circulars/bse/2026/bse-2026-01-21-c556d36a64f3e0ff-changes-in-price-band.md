## Regulatory Changes

The exchange is exercising its surveillance authority to modify price bands from existing levels. Price bands are risk management tools that limit the maximum price movement (up or down) allowed for a security during a trading session. Tighter bands indicate heightened surveillance concerns, while wider bands may reflect reduced restrictions or different risk profiles.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new price bands before market opening on January 22, 2026
- All orders and trades in these securities must comply with the revised price band limits
- Members should inform their clients about the revised trading restrictions
- Any clarifications should be directed to the Surveillance Department at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 21, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 22, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The revised price bands will limit intraday volatility for these securities. Securities with tighter bands (2% and 5%) will have restricted price movement, potentially reducing trading opportunities but enhancing price stability. Modern Diagnostic & Research Centre Ltd with a 20% band has the most trading flexibility among the listed securities.

**Market Participants**: Day traders and short-term investors in these securities will need to adjust their strategies to account for the revised price movement limits. Securities with 2% and 5% bands will require careful position management.

**Surveillance Context**: These revisions appear to be part of ongoing surveillance measures, likely triggered by unusual trading patterns, volatility concerns, or corporate actions. The varied band percentages suggest different risk assessments for each security.
