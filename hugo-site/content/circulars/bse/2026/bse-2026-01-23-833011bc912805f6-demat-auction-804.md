## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 112 scrips across various sectors including auto, consumer goods, infrastructure, energy, financial services, and manufacturing. While this impacts multiple securities, demat auctions are standard settlement mechanisms.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers with short positions in these securities will need to source shares through the auction mechanism, potentially at premium prices. This may lead to temporary price volatility in affected scrips.

**Investor Impact:** Investors in affected securities may observe increased trading volumes and price movements during the auction period. Large shortages in specific scrips (HARSHIL AGRO, Rajnish Well) may see higher impact.

**Systemic Impact:** Low - This is a routine settlement procedure ensuring market integrity and completion of trades. The exchange auction mechanism protects the settlement system.
