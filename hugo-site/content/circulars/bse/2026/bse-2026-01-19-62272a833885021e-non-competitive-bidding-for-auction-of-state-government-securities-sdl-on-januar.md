## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium impact on debt market participants and trading members involved in government securities trading. The non-competitive bidding facility provides retail and smaller institutional investors access to SDL auctions without competing with primary dealers. The Rs. 13,000 crore auction size represents routine SDL issuance for state government financing needs. Trading members must ensure timely bid submission within specified windows to participate in the auction process.
