title: Revision in Eligibility Criteria for Direct Listing and SME Migration to BSE
  Main Board
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the eligibility criteria for two categories of companies seeking access to the Main Board: (1) SME companies migrating from the SME platform, and (2) companies already listed on other recognized stock exchanges seeking direct listing on the Main Board. The criteria cover paid-up capital, market capitalisation, market liquidity, operating profitability, networth, net tangible assets, promoter holding, and lock-in requirements.

## Key Points

- **Paid-up Capital**: Minimum Rs. 10 crores required.
- **Market Capitalisation**: Average 6-month market cap of Rs. 1,000 crores for direct listing on Main Board; Rs. 100 crores for SME migration to Main Board. Alternatively, companies with revenue from operations of Rs. 100 crores or more in each of the preceding 3 full financial years are exempt from this requirement.
- **Market Liquidity**: At least 5% of weighted average listed equity shares traded during the 6-month period; trading on at least 80% of trading days; minimum average daily turnover of Rs. 10 Lakhs and minimum daily turnover of Rs. 5 Lakhs; minimum average 50 daily trades and minimum 25 daily trades. Revenue-based alternate route (Rs. 100 crores for 3 years) also available.
- **Operating Profit (EBITDA)**: Average of Rs. 15 crores on a restated consolidated basis over the preceding 3 years (12 months each), with a minimum of Rs. 10 crores in each of those 3 years.
- **Networth**: Minimum Rs. 1 crore in each of the preceding 3 full years on a restated and consolidated basis.
- **Net Tangible Assets**: At least Rs. 3 crores on a restated and consolidated basis in each of the preceding 3 full years; not more than 50% held in monetary assets (unless firm commitments are made for utilisation).
- **Promoter Holding**: Minimum 20% at the time of application; promoter group shareholding may be counted toward shortfall. Criterion not applicable where there are no identifiable promoters and the company is already listed on a recognized exchange with nationwide trading terminals.
- **Lock-in**: Promoter/promoter group shares locked in for 6 months from the date of listing on BSE. Lock-in does not apply to companies already listed on a recognized exchange with nationwide trading terminals meeting all other eligibility criteria.

## Regulatory Changes

BSE has revised and consolidated the eligibility framework for Main Board access. Key changes include the introduction of a revenue-based alternate route (Rs. 100 crores revenue for 3 consecutive years) as an exemption from both the market capitalisation and market liquidity criteria. The circular also clarifies the calculation methodology for average daily turnover and average number of daily trades, specifying that aggregate figures are divided by total trading days (not just days when the scrip traded).

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies seeking direct listing on BSE Main Board from other recognized exchanges must meet the revised criteria at the time of making the application.
- SME companies seeking migration to the Main Board must satisfy the same consolidated criteria.
- Promoters must ensure minimum 20% holding at application stage; lock-in of 6 months post-listing applies unless the exemption conditions are met.
- If a company has undergone a name change in the last one year, at least 50% of revenue (restated, consolidated) for the preceding full year must be from the activity indicated by its new name.
- Companies with more than 50% of net tangible assets in monetary form must demonstrate utilisation or firm commitments to deploy such assets in their business or project.

## Important Dates

- Circular date: 23 February 2026.
- Effective date: Not explicitly stated in the extracted content; companies should refer to the full circular for the operative date.

## Impact Assessment

This revision raises the bar for direct listing on BSE's Main Board (Rs. 1,000 crores average market cap threshold) while providing a revenue-based alternate route that benefits operationally strong but smaller-cap companies. The liquidity criteria with specific daily turnover and trade count thresholds tighten the standards for companies from other exchanges. SME companies benefit from the lower Rs. 100 crore market cap threshold for migration. The lock-in and promoter holding exemptions for already-listed companies with nationwide trading terminals reduce regulatory friction for cross-listings. Overall, the circular is significant for any SME platform company or regionally listed company considering a move to BSE's Main Board.
