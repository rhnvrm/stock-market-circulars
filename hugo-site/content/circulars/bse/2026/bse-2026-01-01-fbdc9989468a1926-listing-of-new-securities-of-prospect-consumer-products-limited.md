## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing announcement with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment of 5,99,160 shares represents a modest increase in the company's equity capital. The lock-in provisions ensure that a majority of shares (5,40,000) are locked until July 2026, with a smaller portion (59,160 shares) locked until July 2027. This is typical for preferential allotments and helps prevent immediate dilution pressure on existing shareholders. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new securities and observe the lock-in restrictions.
