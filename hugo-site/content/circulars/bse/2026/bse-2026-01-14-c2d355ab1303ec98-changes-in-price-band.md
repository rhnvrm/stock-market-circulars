## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The revised price bands will affect daily price movement limits for these securities. Tighter bands (2%-5%) restrict volatility and protect investors from sharp price swings, while wider bands (10%) allow more price discovery. 

**Trading Impact:** Traders and investors in these scrips must adjust their strategies based on the new daily movement limits. PH Capital's 2% band is particularly restrictive, suggesting heightened surveillance concerns.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and trading members must update their risk management systems, circuit breaker mechanisms, and order validation logic to accommodate the new price bands before market opening on January 16, 2026.
