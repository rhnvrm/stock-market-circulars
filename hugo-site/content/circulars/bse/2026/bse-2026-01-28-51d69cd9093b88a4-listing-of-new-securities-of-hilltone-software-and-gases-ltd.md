## Impact Assessment

This listing represents a capital raise through preferential allotment for Hilltone Software and Gases Ltd. The lock-in period until August 16, 2026, means these shares cannot be traded during this period, preventing immediate supply increase. The dilution effect is company-specific with no broader market implications. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the expanded share capital and lock-in restrictions.
