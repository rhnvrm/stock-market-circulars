Effective January 05, 2026, eight securities are being added to the surveillance list while one security (Sagar Cements Ltd) is being removed. The consolidated list now contains 12 securities under this surveillance measure.

## Key Points

- Framework based on SEBI (SAST) Regulation 2011, Regulation 28(3)
- Several securities are common with NSE's surveillance list

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular implements existing surveillance measures under SEBI (SAST) Regulations 2011, specifically Regulation 28(3) which deals with disclosure of encumbrance by promoters and persons in control.

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies under surveillance must continue monitoring and disclosing promoter encumbrance levels
- Companies must comply with SEBI (SAST) Regulation 28(3) disclosure requirements
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance applicable to these securities
- Trading in these securities may be subject to additional monitoring and restrictions as per exchange surveillance norms

## Important Dates

- **January 05, 2026**: Effective date for updated surveillance list
- **January 02, 2026**: Circular issue date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Securities under high encumbrance surveillance may experience reduced liquidity and increased investor caution due to heightened pledge levels by promoters.

**Trading Impact**: Securities listed may face additional price bands, trading restrictions, or periodic call auctions depending on exchange surveillance protocols.

**Companies Affected**:
- **Added to Surveillance**: B.L. Kashyap and Sons Ltd, Hindustan Zinc Ltd, Panorama Studios International Ltd, SPML Infra Ltd, Steel Exchange India Ltd, Thyrocare Technologies Ltd, Trualt Bioenergy Ltd, Veranda Learning Solutions Ltd
- **Removed from Surveillance**: Sagar Cements Ltd (encumbrance levels normalized)

**Investor Consideration**: High promoter encumbrance indicates significant pledging of shares, which can pose risks during market volatility including potential invocation of pledges and change in control scenarios.
