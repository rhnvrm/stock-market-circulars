## Impact Assessment

The listing represents a significant equity dilution through preferential allotment totaling over 12.7 million shares. The staggered lock-in periods (expiring in 2026 and 2027) indicate a mix of promoter and non-promoter participation. Approximately 90.75 lakh shares (71.3%) have lock-in until July 2026, while 36.5 lakh shares (28.7%) are locked until July 2027. The preferential issue at Rs. 13.25 suggests fundraising for business operations. Trading members should note the lock-in restrictions when executing trades. Impact is moderate as this follows standard preferential allotment procedures with defined lock-in schedules.
