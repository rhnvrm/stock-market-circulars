- Inclusion in GSM Framework
- Inclusion in Pledge Framework
- Inclusion in ESM Framework

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with enhanced surveillance requirements for securities under ST-ASM
- Higher margin requirements and trading restrictions apply to ASM securities
- Stage movements indicate escalating or de-escalating surveillance intensity
- Special notations apply: (*) for NSE alignment, (@) for SME scrips, (~) for T+0 scrips

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** January 29, 2026
- All changes to ST-ASM classifications take effect from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

The ST-ASM framework impacts liquidity and trading activity in affected securities. Securities newly added or moved to higher stages face increased scrutiny, higher margin requirements, and potential trading restrictions. The framework aims to protect investor interests by monitoring securities with unusual price or volume movements. Investors and traders should be aware of the enhanced surveillance measures when trading in these securities.
