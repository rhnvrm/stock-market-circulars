title: BSE Demat Auction Settlement No. 828 - February 26, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE Ltd., Mumbai has published the Demat Auction list for Settlement No. 828 dated 26/02/2026. This auction covers securities where short delivery obligations arose and the exchange will conduct an auction to fulfill the delivery requirements. A total of 61 scrips are listed across diverse sectors including banking, IT, FMCG, energy, infrastructure, and pharmaceuticals.

## Key Points

- Settlement No. 828 dated 26/02/2026
- 61 securities listed for demat auction
- Quantities range from 1 share (multiple scrips) to 37,000 shares (Viram Suvarna, scrip 540252)
- Large quantity auctions include: SBL Infratech (28,800), Empower India (14,136), Viram Suvarna (37,000), Dilip Buildcon (5,000), Himatsingka (6,043)
- Covers scrips from major indices as well as SME/smaller companies
- Auction is a standard mechanism to remedy short delivery in settlement

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational notice under BSE's standard settlement and auction procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members with short delivery obligations in the listed securities must participate or be subject to auction settlement
- Auction participants must adhere to BSE's auction trading rules and timelines
- Close-out prices will apply to short-delivered quantities not covered in the auction

## Important Dates

- Auction Date: 26/02/2026 (Settlement No. 828)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine demat auction notice with low systemic impact. Individual securities listed may experience minor price discovery effects during the auction session. The largest quantities being auctioned—Viram Suvarna (37,000 shares), SBL Infratech (28,800 shares), and Empower India (14,136 shares)—are in relatively low-liquidity scrips, so auction prices may diverge from market prices. Members holding short positions in the listed securities should take note of their obligations. No broader market impact is expected.
