## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division from Rs.10/- to Re.1/- represents a 10:1 split, which typically makes shares more affordable for retail investors and may improve liquidity. The new ISIN ensures proper identification and settlement of post-subdivision shares.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members must update their systems to recognize the new ISIN from the ex-date. While this is a routine corporate action, system updates and proper tracking are essential to avoid trading or settlement errors.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders will receive 10 shares of Re.1/- face value for every 1 share of Rs.10/- face value held. The total investment value remains unchanged, but the number of shares increases proportionally.
