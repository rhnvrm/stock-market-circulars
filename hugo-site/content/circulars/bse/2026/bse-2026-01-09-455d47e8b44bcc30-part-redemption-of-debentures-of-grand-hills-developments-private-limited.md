## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it pertains to privately placed debentures of a private limited company. The part redemption is a standard corporate action that reduces the outstanding principal amount of the debenture issue. Debenture holders on record as of January 16, 2026 will receive the redemption proceeds and interest payment. Post-redemption, the debentures will continue to trade with the reduced face value of Rs. 89,688 per debenture. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face value for proper valuation and settlement.
