title: Changes in Price Band for 23 Securities Effective January 8, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for 23 securities effective January 8, 2026. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20% across different scrips, replacing their existing levels. This surveillance measure adjusts the daily price movement limits allowed for these securities during trading sessions.

## Key Points

- 23 scrips will have revised price bands effective January 8, 2026
- Price bands range from 2% (tightest) to 20% (widest)
- Most scrips (13) have been assigned a 5% price band
- 3 scrips have 2% price band (Checkpoint Trends, Deccan Bearings, Ramchandra Leasing & Finance, Onix Solar Energy)
- 4 scrips have 10% price band (Rollatainers, Samtel India, SIMANDHAR IMPEX, VINEET LABORATORIES)
- 1 scrip has 20% price band (Global Ocean Logistics India)
- Trading members should adjust their risk management systems accordingly
- Clarifications can be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions are surveillance measures that restrict the maximum price movement allowed in a single trading day. The changes represent adjustments to existing price bands based on surveillance criteria such as volatility, trading patterns, or market stability concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their trading systems to reflect the new price bands before market opening on January 8, 2026
- Risk management systems should be recalibrated for affected securities
- Members should inform clients trading in these securities about the revised price movement limits
- Any clarifications should be sought from BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 7, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 8, 2026

## Impact Assessment

### Trading Impact
The revised price bands will directly affect intraday trading limits for all 23 securities. Tighter bands (2%) will restrict volatility but may reduce trading opportunities, while wider bands (20%) allow greater price movement but increase risk exposure.

### Investor Impact
Investors holding or trading these securities need to adjust their strategies based on the new daily price movement limits. Stop-loss orders and limit orders may need recalibration.

### Market Segments Affected
- All 23 securities are in the Equity segment
- Mix of companies across industries including manufacturing, finance, technology, and logistics

### Risk Considerations
Tighter price bands (2-5%) suggest heightened surveillance concern, while wider bands (10-20%) may indicate acceptance of higher volatility or different market dynamics for those specific securities.
