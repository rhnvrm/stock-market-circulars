## Impact Assessment

This bulletin is of moderate relevance to institutional and retail investors holding privately placed NCDs or commercial papers from the listed issuers. Bajaj Finance, being a major NBFC, has numerous NCD tranches with staggered record dates extending to 2031, reflecting its active debt capital market presence. DSP Finance has a cluster of short-term CP redemptions in March 2026, indicating routine refinancing activity. No immediate equity market impact is expected; the bulletin is primarily actionable for debt instrument holders and registrars managing these corporate actions.
