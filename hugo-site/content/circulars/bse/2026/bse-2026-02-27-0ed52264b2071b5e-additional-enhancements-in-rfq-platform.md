title: Additional Enhancements in BSE RFQ Platform for Debt Segment
---

## Summary

BSE has announced additional enhancements to its Request for Quote (RFQ) platform for the Debt segment, building on earlier notice 20251017-27 dated October 17, 2025. These improvements are in line with SEBI directions and are aimed at improving user experience for fixed income market participants. The enhancements will go live from **March 02, 2026**.

## Key Points

- Four major feature additions have been made to the RFQ platform effective March 02, 2026.
- The Market Watch screen now displays Credit Rating, Type of Yield (YTM/YTC/YTP), and Maturity/Put/Call dates.
- Participants can create customized market views using filters such as Issuer, Sector, Instrument Type, Maturity Buckets, Odd/Market Lots, Value, and ISIN.
- A new Broad Clubbed Quoting Facility allows placing clubbed bids/offers across securities grouped by Issuer, Rating, and Maturity Buckets.
- Additional security information including Maturity date, Cash flow details, Credit Rating, and Sector is now displayed on the RFQ platform.
- These changes are driven by SEBI directions to improve the fixed income market ecosystem.

## Regulatory Changes

These enhancements are implemented pursuant to SEBI directions, as referenced in earlier BSE notice 20251017-27 dated October 17, 2025. The changes improve transparency and usability of the RFQ platform but do not impose new regulatory obligations on participants.

## Compliance Requirements

- No specific compliance actions are required from market participants.
- Participants are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the new features before the effective date of March 02, 2026.
- For queries or clarifications, participants should contact the BSE Fixed Income team at fixedIncome@bseindia.com.

## Important Dates

- **February 27, 2026**: Notice issued.
- **March 02, 2026**: All enhancements go live on the RFQ platform.

## Impact Assessment

These enhancements are positive for fixed income market participants, particularly institutional investors and debt market intermediaries actively using the BSE RFQ platform. The upgraded Market Watch with credit rating and yield type visibility improves pre-trade transparency. The customized market view and clubbed quoting facility are particularly beneficial for participants managing large or diversified debt portfolios, enabling more efficient price discovery and execution. Overall market impact is moderate — this is an incremental operational improvement rather than a structural market change.
