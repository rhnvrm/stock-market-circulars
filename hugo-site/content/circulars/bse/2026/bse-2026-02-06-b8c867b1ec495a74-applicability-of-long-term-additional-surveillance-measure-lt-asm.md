## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective February 09, 2026. The circular identifies 4 new securities entering the framework, 8 securities moving to lower ASM stages, and 14 securities exiting the framework. No securities are moving to higher stages. The LT-ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities displaying abnormal price movements and requires additional surveillance measures including higher margins and trade restrictions.

## Key Points

- 4 securities newly shortlisted under Long Term ASM Framework: Loyal Textile Mills Ltd, Prime Focus Ltd, Pune E-Stock Broking Ltd, and Steelman Telecom Ltd
- 8 securities continuing in LT-ASM but moving to lower surveillance stages (reduced restrictions)
- 14 securities moving out of Long Term ASM Framework entirely
- No securities moving to higher surveillance stages
- Changes effective from February 09, 2026
- Most securities exiting the framework are being moved to Trade for Trade segment instead

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements periodic review changes to the Long Term ASM Framework:

**Part A - New Entries:** Four securities enter LT-ASM surveillance framework, subjecting them to additional monitoring and trading restrictions.

**Part B - Higher Stage Movements:** No securities are being moved to stricter surveillance stages.

**Part C - Lower Stage Movements:** Eight securities are being moved to less restrictive surveillance stages:
- A-1 Ltd (moved to Stage III)
- Axiscades Technologies Ltd (moved to Stage I)
- BGR Energy Systems Ltd (moved to Stage I)
- Kothari Industrial Corporation Ltd (moved to Stage I)
- Lotus Eye Hospital And Institute Ltd (moved to Stage I)
- Megasoft Ltd (moved to Stage III)
- NACL Industries Ltd (moved to Stage II)
- Stallion India Fluorochemicals Ltd (moved to Stage I)

**Part D - Direct Stage IV Entries:** No securities are being placed directly in Stage IV.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ASM stage-specific requirements for affected securities
- Securities in LT-ASM are subject to 100% upfront margin requirements
- Price bands and other trading restrictions apply based on ASM stage
- Investors must be made aware of securities under surveillance framework
- Members should review their holdings and positions in affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 06, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 09, 2026 (all changes become applicable)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The changes affect 26 securities in total. The movement of 8 securities to lower surveillance stages indicates improved market behavior and may lead to increased liquidity and reduced trading costs for those stocks. The exit of 14 securities from LT-ASM (though most move to Trade for Trade) suggests completion of surveillance objectives or transition to other regulatory frameworks.

**Trading Impact:** 
- New entrants will face stricter trading conditions including higher margins and potential price bands
- Securities moving to lower stages will benefit from relaxed restrictions
- Securities exiting to Trade for Trade will continue under different surveillance mechanisms
- Overall, more securities are seeing reduced restrictions than increased ones, suggesting positive market behavior trends

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding securities newly entering LT-ASM should expect reduced liquidity and mandatory delivery-based trading. Those holding securities moving to lower stages may see improved trading conditions and potentially better price discovery.
