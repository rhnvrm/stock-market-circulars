No new regulatory changes. This circular is an operational notice in accordance with BSE listing regulations for newly allotted securities under preferential allotment/warrant conversion provisions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities now available for trading from February 27, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 5 million shares to the equity base of Arihant Capital Markets Ltd., a BSE-listed financial services and broking company. Since all newly listed shares are issued to promoters and are locked in until September 2027, there is **no immediate addition to tradeable free float**, limiting short-term market impact. The preferential allotment through warrant conversion indicates promoter confidence and a planned capital-raising exercise. Traders and investors should note the dilution to existing shareholders but should not expect any near-term selling pressure from these shares given the extended lock-in period.
