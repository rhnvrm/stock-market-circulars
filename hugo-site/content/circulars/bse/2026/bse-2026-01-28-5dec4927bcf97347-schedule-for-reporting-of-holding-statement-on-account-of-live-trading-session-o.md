## Summary

BSE has issued revised schedule for submission of holding statements by trading members due to the special live trading session on Sunday, February 01, 2026 on account of the Union Budget presentation. The holding statement reporting deadlines for trades from January 30 to February 2, 2026 have been adjusted to February 2-3, 2026.

## Key Points

- Special trading session scheduled on Sunday, February 1, 2026 due to Union Budget presentation
- Modified reporting schedule for holding statements covering four trade dates
- All holding statements for trades from January 30 to February 1, 2026 due on February 2, 2026
- Holding statement for trades on February 2, 2026 due on February 3, 2026
- Circular references previous notices from January 27, 2023 and January 16, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a temporary adjustment to accommodate the special trading session on a Sunday due to the Union Budget presentation.

## Compliance Requirements

**Trading Members must comply with the following revised schedule:**

| Trade Date | Holding Statement Due Date |
|------------|---------------------------|
| January 30, 2026 | February 2, 2026 |
| January 31, 2026 | February 2, 2026 |
| February 1, 2026 | February 2, 2026 |
| February 2, 2026 | February 3, 2026 |

Trading members are advised to take note and ensure timely submission of holding statements as per the modified schedule.

## Important Dates

- **January 28, 2026**: Notice issued
- **January 30-31, 2026**: Regular trade dates with modified reporting
- **February 1, 2026**: Special live trading session (Sunday) due to Union Budget presentation
- **February 2, 2026**: Extended deadline for holding statements for trades dated January 30, 31, and February 1
- **February 3, 2026**: Deadline for holding statement for trades dated February 2

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to adjust their reporting workflows to account for the consolidated deadline on February 2, 2026 for three trade dates. This may require additional coordination and system adjustments.

**Market Impact**: Minimal market impact as this is an administrative reporting adjustment. The special Sunday trading session itself may see increased activity due to Union Budget announcements.

**Compliance Impact**: Members must ensure their reporting systems and processes are updated to reflect the modified timeline to avoid non-compliance. The consolidated reporting for multiple trade dates on a single day may require additional resource allocation.
