## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - The number of shares being listed represents a small fraction of the total outstanding shares for each company. These are routine ESOP/ESOS conversions that occur regularly.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal - The additional shares may marginally increase the float for each company, but the quantities are relatively small.

**Investor Impact**: Neutral - No lock-in restrictions mean these shares are immediately tradable. ESOP/ESOS conversions typically indicate employee confidence but have limited impact on stock prices given the small volumes.

**Operational Impact**: Standard administrative update requiring system updates by trading members to account for the increased share count.
