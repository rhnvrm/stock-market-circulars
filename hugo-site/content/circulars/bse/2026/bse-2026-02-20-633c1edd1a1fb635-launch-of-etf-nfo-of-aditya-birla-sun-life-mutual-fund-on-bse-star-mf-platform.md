## Impact Assessment

This circular is operationally relevant to BSE members and distributors facilitating mutual fund transactions on the BSE StAR MF Platform. Investors in banking-sector equity ETFs have a new instrument focused on the top 10 banks. The impact is moderate — primarily affecting members who need to manage client transaction timelines and fund settlement carefully to meet the ICCL funding deadline. No market-wide disruption is expected.
