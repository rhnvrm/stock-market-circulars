## Impact Assessment

This is a standard IPO listing with medium market impact. The listing adds a new technology company to BSE's trading platform. The varied lock-in periods indicate different categories of shareholders (promoters, pre-IPO investors, and public offer). The 5-year lock-in on certain shares (until 2031) suggests significant promoter holdings, which provides stability. The OFS component with shorter lock-in and fresh issue components indicate a balanced offering structure.
