## Impact Assessment

| Company | Scrip Code | ISIN | Shares Added | Face Value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Centum Electronics Limited | 517544 | INE320B01020 | 4,833 | ₹10 |
| CreditAccess Grameen Ltd. | 541770 | INE741K01010 | 11,675 | ₹10 |
| EPL Limited | 500135 | INE255A01020 | 13,942 | ₹2 |
| Federal Bank Limited | 500469 | INE171A01029 | 4,18,906 | ₹2 |
| ICICI Bank Limited | 532174 | INE090A01021 | 3,69,765 | ₹2 |
| ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. | 540716 | INE765G01017 | 47,109 | ₹10 |
| ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd. | 540133 | INE726G01019 | 1,24,912 | ₹10 |
| Marico Limited | 531642 | INE196A01026 | 17,077 | ₹1 |
| Natural Capsules Limited | 524654 | INE936B01015 | 45,000 | ₹10 |
| Poonawalla Fincorp Limited | 524000 | INE511C01022 | 68,092 | ₹2 |
| SBI Life Insurance Company Limited | 540719 | INE123W01016 | 1,86,958 | ₹10 |
| UNO Minda Limited | 532539 | INE405E01023 | 3,64,806 | ₹2 |

The additions represent routine dilution from employee compensation plans. Given the large existing float of most companies listed (particularly ICICI Bank, Federal Bank, and SBI Life), the incremental share counts are negligible and are unlikely to cause any material price or liquidity impact.
