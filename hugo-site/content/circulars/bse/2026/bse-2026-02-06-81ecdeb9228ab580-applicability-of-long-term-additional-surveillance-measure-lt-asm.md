## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective February 09, 2026. Four securities are newly entering the framework, eight securities are being moved to lower ASM stages within the framework, and fourteen securities are exiting the LT-ASM framework. No securities are being moved to higher ASM stages.

## Key Points

- 4 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Loyal Textile Mills Ltd, Prime Focus Ltd, Pune E-Stock Broking Ltd, and Steelman Telecom Ltd
- 8 securities moved to lower ASM stages (reduced surveillance): A-1 Ltd, Axiscades Technologies Ltd, BGR Energy Systems Ltd, Kothari Industrial Corporation Ltd, Lotus Eye Hospital And Institute Ltd, Megasoft Ltd, NACL Industries Ltd, and Stallion India Fluorochemicals Ltd
- 14 securities moving out of LT-ASM Framework: Atvo Enterprises Ltd, Flex Foods Ltd, Fundviser Capital (India) Ltd, Garnet International Ltd, Genesis Ibrc India Ltd, IFB Agro Industries Ltd, Indo Thai Securities Ltd, Jaihind Synthetics Ltd, JJ Finance Corporation Ltd, MP Agro Industries Ltd, Parvati Sweetners and Power Ltd, PPAP Automotive Ltd, Trescon Ltd, and Trustedge Capital Ltd
- No securities being moved to higher ASM stages
- No securities shortlisted for direct Stage IV placement
- Most securities exiting LT-ASM are being moved to Trade for Trade framework

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities that exhibit sustained concerning trading patterns or characteristics. Securities in this framework face additional restrictions including:

- Reduced leverage for trading
- Higher margin requirements
- Enhanced disclosure obligations
- Staged escalation based on continued concerns

Movement to lower stages indicates improved trading behavior, while entry into the framework indicates heightened surveillance concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable margin and leverage requirements for securities under LT-ASM
- Enhanced pre-trade risk controls apply to affected securities
- Members must communicate the surveillance status to their clients trading these securities
- Securities moved to Trade for Trade framework require full upfront delivery and payment

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 09, 2026 - All LT-ASM framework changes become effective

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The movement of 8 securities to lower ASM stages provides relief through reduced margins and improved liquidity. However, 4 new entries face increased trading costs and restrictions. The exit of 14 securities, mostly to Trade for Trade framework, may reduce liquidity for those stocks but removes ASM-specific restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding securities entering LT-ASM will face higher margin requirements and reduced intraday leverage. Those holding securities moving to lower stages benefit from relaxed trading conditions. Securities exiting to Trade for Trade will require full upfront payment and delivery, eliminating intraday trading opportunities.

**Broker Impact**: Brokers must update their risk management systems to reflect new ASM stages and ensure proper margin collection for the 4 new LT-ASM securities. Additional client communication is required for all 26 affected securities.
