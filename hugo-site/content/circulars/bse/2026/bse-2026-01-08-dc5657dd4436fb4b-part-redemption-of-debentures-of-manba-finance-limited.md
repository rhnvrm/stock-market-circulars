## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. This is a routine corporate action affecting only holders of this specific debenture series.

**Investor Impact**: Medium for debenture holders. Investors holding these debentures will receive partial redemption proceeds and interest payment. The face value reduction from the original amount to Rs. 5,555.56 indicates a significant partial redemption.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face value for accurate settlement and trading. The proximity of this part redemption to the final maturity date (February 28, 2026) suggests this may be one of the final redemption installments before full maturity.
