## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal broader market impact as it pertains solely to the IPO listing mechanics of Shree Ram Twistex Limited. Approximately 26.5% of total shares (10,600,000) are freely tradeable from listing. The remaining 73.5% (29,375,000 shares) are subject to lock-in periods ranging from approximately 7 months to over 3 years, which is standard for promoter and pre-IPO investor holdings. Retail investors who received IPO allotment are unaffected by the lock-in restrictions.
