## Impact Assessment

This auction affects delivery defaulters across ~95 scrips, with SPICEJET LTD recording the highest auction quantity (3,72,400 shares), suggesting notable delivery failures in that counter. The inclusion of large-cap and widely-held stocks (SBI, TCS, Tata Motors, ITC, HCL Tech) indicates scattered delivery shortfalls rather than a concentrated sector event. Participants on the short side of these trades face auction prices which may be at a premium to market, resulting in financial penalties. Overall market impact is limited and localized to the affected settlement positions.
