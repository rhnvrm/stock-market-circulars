title: Revision in Eligibility Criteria for Direct Listing on BSE Main Board
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the eligibility criteria applicable to SME companies seeking migration to the Main Board and for companies listed on other recognized stock exchanges seeking direct listing on the BSE Main Board. The criteria cover paid-up capital, market capitalisation, market liquidity, operating profit (EBITDA), networth, net tangible assets, promoter holding, and lock-in requirements.

## Key Points

- Minimum paid-up capital of at least Rs. 10 crores required.
- Direct listing (Main Board) requires average 6-month market capitalisation of Rs. 1,000 crores; SME migration requires Rs. 100 crores.
- Alternatively, companies with revenue from operations of Rs. 100 crores or more for each of the preceding 3 full financial years qualify on the market capitalisation criterion.
- Market liquidity criteria: at least 5% of weighted average equity shares traded in 6 months; trading on at least 80% of trading days; minimum average daily turnover of Rs. 10 lakhs (minimum daily Rs. 5 lakhs); minimum average 50 daily trades (minimum daily 25 trades).
- Average operating profit (EBITDA) of Rs. 15 crores on restated consolidated basis over preceding 3 years, with minimum Rs. 10 crores in each year.
- Networth of at least Rs. 1 crore in each of the preceding 3 full financial years.
- Net tangible assets of at least Rs. 3 crores in each of the preceding 3 years; not more than 50% held in monetary assets (or firm commitments required for excess).
- Minimum promoter holding of 20% at the time of application; promoter group shareholding may be considered for shortfall.
- Promoter/promoter group shares subject to a lock-in of 6 months from date of listing on BSE.

## Regulatory Changes

- Eligibility thresholds for direct listing on Main Board raised to Rs. 1,000 crores average market capitalisation (vs. previous norms).
- Revenue-based alternative route (Rs. 100 crores revenue for 3 years) introduced as a qualifying path for both market capitalisation and market liquidity criteria.
- Promoter holding minimum set at 20%, with an exemption for diversified-holding companies or those with no identifiable promoters already listed on a recognized exchange with nationwide trading terminals.
- Lock-in exemption granted for companies already listed on a recognized stock exchange with nationwide trading terminals meeting all other eligibility criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must demonstrate compliance with all applicable financial thresholds on a restated and consolidated basis.
- In case of a name change within the last one year, at least 50% of revenue for the preceding full year must be earned from the activity indicated by the new name.
- If more than 50% of net tangible assets are held in monetary assets, the company must have utilised or made firm commitments to deploy such excess monetary assets in its business or project.
- Promoter holding must be at least 20% at the time of making the application; promoter group holding may be included to meet any shortfall.

## Important Dates

- Circular dated: 23 February 2026.
- Effective date: Not explicitly stated in the extracted content; companies applying for migration or direct listing after this circular must comply with the revised criteria.

## Impact Assessment

- **SME Companies:** SMEs planning migration to the Main Board must meet stricter liquidity and profitability benchmarks, potentially delaying migration for smaller or less-liquid companies.
- **Regionally Listed Companies:** Companies listed on other recognized exchanges seeking direct listing on BSE Main Board now face a significantly higher market capitalisation threshold of Rs. 1,000 crores, narrowing the eligible pool.
- **Revenue-Based Alternative:** The introduction of a Rs. 100 crore revenue threshold as an alternative qualifying route provides a pathway for operationally strong but lower-cap companies.
- **Promoter Obligations:** The 6-month lock-in and 20% minimum holding requirement adds compliance burden and restricts early exit for promoters post-listing.
- **Market Quality:** Tighter liquidity criteria (turnover, trading days, trade frequency) aim to ensure only sufficiently liquid securities access the Main Board, improving overall market quality.
