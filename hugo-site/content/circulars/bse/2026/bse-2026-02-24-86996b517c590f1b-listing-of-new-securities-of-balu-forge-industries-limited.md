## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Date of Allotment | December 30, 2025 |
| BSE Notice Date | February 24, 2026 |
| Trading Commencement | February 25, 2026 |
| Lock-in Expiry | August 30, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

**Dilution:** The issuance of 10,00,000 new equity shares dilutes the existing shareholding structure. Existing shareholders should account for the increased share count when evaluating per-share metrics.

**Lock-in:** All newly listed shares are locked in until August 30, 2026, restricting their tradability and limiting immediate selling pressure from the allottees.

**Price Reference:** At the issue price of Rs. 360/-, the total capital raised amounts to Rs. 36,00,00,000 (Rs. 36 crore), reflecting the premium paid by non-promoter allottees for warrant conversion.

**Market Impact:** Low short-term market impact given the lock-in. Post lock-in expiry (August 30, 2026), potential increase in floating supply should be monitored.
