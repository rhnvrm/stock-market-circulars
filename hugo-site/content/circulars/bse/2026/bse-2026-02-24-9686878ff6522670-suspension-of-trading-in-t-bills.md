## Summary

BSE has issued a notice (No. 20260224-10) informing trading members that two Treasury Bills — 182TB27226 (Scrip Code: 805110) and 364TB27226 (Scrip Code: 805033) — are set to mature on their redemption date of February 25, 2026. Trading in these instruments is suspended effective February 25, 2026.

## Key Points

- Two T-Bills are maturing on February 25, 2026 and will no longer be available for trading.
- Scrip Code 805110 (ISIN: IN002025Y222) — 182-day T-Bill 182TB27226 is affected.
- Scrip Code 805033 (ISIN: IN002024Z461) — 364-day T-Bill 364TB27226 is affected.
- Trading members are explicitly advised not to deal in these T-Bills from February 25, 2026 onwards.
- This notice is issued under DR-828/2025-2026.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes are introduced. This is a standard operational notice triggered by the scheduled maturity of treasury bills under existing exchange procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealings in Scrip Code 805110 (IN002025Y222) and Scrip Code 805033 (IN002024Z461) with effect from February 25, 2026.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 24, 2026
- **Suspension Effective Date:** February 25, 2026 (Redemption/Maturity Date)

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this circular is limited and routine. The suspension applies only to two specific T-Bills reaching their scheduled maturity, which is a standard lifecycle event for government debt instruments. No broader market disruption is expected. Holders of these T-Bills will receive redemption proceeds as per normal settlement procedures on the maturity date.
