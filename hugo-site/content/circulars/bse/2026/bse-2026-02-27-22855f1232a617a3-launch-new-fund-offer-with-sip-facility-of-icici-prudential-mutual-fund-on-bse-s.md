## Impact Assessment

This notice is relevant to BSE member firms offering mutual fund transactions through the BSE StAR MF platform. Members need to ensure clients are aware of the fund transfer deadlines to avoid cancellation of NFO transactions. The scheme category is Equity (Fund of Funds), targeting investors seeking diversified equity exposure across market capitalizations. Operational risk is low if members communicate the payment and SIP authentication deadlines clearly to clients.
