title: Additional Exposure Margin on Securities under MWPL – January 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular imposing additional exposure margin requirements on 18 securities under the Market-Wide Position Limit (MWPL) framework for January 2026. This measure is designed to manage concentration risk and ensure market stability for securities that have reached or are approaching position limit thresholds. The affected securities include major names across banking, energy, steel, pharma, and infrastructure sectors.

## Key Points

- 18 securities subject to additional exposure margin under MWPL framework
- Includes major stocks like RBL Bank, JSW Energy, SAIL, Vodafone Idea, NMDC, Bandhan Bank, and Indus Towers
- Covers diverse sectors: banking, energy, steel, pharmaceuticals, FMCG, infrastructure, and telecom
- Additional margins increase trading costs and reduce leverage for these securities
- Part of BSE's risk management framework to control concentration risk

## Regulatory Changes

BSE has activated additional exposure margin requirements for the listed 18 securities under the MWPL framework. This regulatory measure is applied when securities approach market-wide position limits, requiring brokers and traders to maintain higher margins for positions in these stocks. The framework aims to prevent excessive concentration and potential market manipulation.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must collect and maintain additional exposure margins from clients for positions in the specified 18 securities
- Brokers must ensure adequate margin coverage before executing trades in these securities
- Enhanced monitoring of position limits and margin adequacy required
- Members must comply with the margin collection framework as per exchange regulations
- Failure to maintain adequate margins may result in position squaring off or trading restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Period**: January 2026
- **Circular Date**: January 27, 2026
- Margins applicable immediately for all new and existing positions in the specified securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The additional exposure margin requirements on 18 securities will increase the cost of trading and reduce available leverage for market participants. This may lead to reduced liquidity and trading volumes in these stocks as traders face higher capital requirements.

**Affected Sectors**: Banking (RBL Bank, Bandhan Bank, LIC Housing Finance, PNB Housing Finance), Energy (JSW Energy, Petronet LNG), Metals (SAIL, NMDC), Pharmaceuticals (Aurobindo Pharma, Glenmark), Telecom (Vodafone Idea, Indus Towers), and FMCG (Patanjali Foods, Crompton Greaves).

**Trading Strategy Impact**: Traders and investors holding positions in these securities will need to allocate more capital for margin requirements, potentially forcing position reductions or portfolio rebalancing. Intraday traders may find these stocks less attractive due to higher margin costs.

**Risk Management**: The measure enhances market stability by preventing excessive concentration in these securities and reducing systemic risk from large position buildups.
