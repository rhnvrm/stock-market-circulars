## Summary

BSE has updated the list of securities under the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective January 02, 2026. The circular identifies 9 securities newly shortlisted under ST-ASM, 1 security moving to higher stage ASM, 1 security moving to lower stage ASM, and 9 securities moving out of the ST-ASM framework. The ST-ASM framework applies 5/15/30 day surveillance measures to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements.

## Key Points

- 9 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework
- 1 security (V B Industries Ltd) continuing in ST-ASM but moving to higher Stage ASM
- 1 security (Spright Agro Ltd) continuing in ST-ASM but moving to lower Stage ASM
- 9 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework
- Some securities moving out due to inclusion in other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM)
- Framework includes both main board and SME scrips
- Consolidated list provided showing all securities currently under ST-ASM with their respective stages

## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework continues to be applied with stage-based surveillance levels (5/15/30 days) based on price volatility and trading patterns. Securities are evaluated periodically and moved between stages or frameworks based on their trading behavior.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and investors must be aware of securities under ST-ASM framework
- Enhanced margin requirements and trading restrictions apply to securities under ASM
- Market participants should monitor the consolidated list for complete coverage of affected securities
- Special attention required for securities marked with symbols indicating SME scrips (@) or alignment with NSE (*)

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 02, 2026 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects trading in 27 securities with potential impact on liquidity and trading volumes in these scrips.

**Investor Impact**: Investors and traders in the affected securities will face enhanced surveillance measures including higher margins and potential trading restrictions. Those holding securities moving out of ST-ASM may see reduced restrictions, while new entrants will face increased trading costs.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to update their systems and risk management frameworks to reflect the new ST-ASM classifications and margin requirements for affected securities.
