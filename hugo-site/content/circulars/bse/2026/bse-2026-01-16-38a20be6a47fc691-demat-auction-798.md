## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The demat auction affects 98 scrips with varying quantities. While this is a routine settlement process, it indicates delivery failures across multiple securities.

**Operational Impact:** The auction will require affected members to procure securities through the auction mechanism, potentially at prices different from the original transaction prices. Members with failed obligations will face additional costs and operational requirements to close out positions.

**Investor Impact:** Localized impact on specific securities where delivery failures have occurred. The auction mechanism ensures settlement completion but may result in price volatility for the affected scrips during the auction process.
