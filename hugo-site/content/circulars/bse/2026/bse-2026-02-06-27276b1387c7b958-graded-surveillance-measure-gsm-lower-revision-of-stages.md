title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Lower Revision of Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the downward revision of Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages for 56 securities. These revisions reflect improved compliance, trading behavior, or other positive developments that warrant reduced surveillance intensity. The securities span across various groups (XT, Z, X, B, T, TS, P) and are being moved from higher stages (Stage 4, 3, 2, or 1) to lower stages (Stage 3, 2, 1, or 0).

## Key Points

- 56 securities have been granted lower GSM stage classifications
- Stage revisions include: 4→3 (24 securities), 3→2 (7 securities), 2→1 (17 securities), 1→0 (8 securities)
- Affected securities are in various trading groups: XT (majority), X, Z, B, T, TS, and P
- Lower stages indicate reduced surveillance measures and restrictions
- This represents a positive development for the affected companies

## Regulatory Changes

The downward revision of GSM stages means:
- Reduced surveillance intensity for the affected securities
- Potentially lower trading restrictions compared to higher stages
- Improved compliance status recognition by the exchange
- Securities may see better liquidity and investor confidence

## Compliance Requirements

For the affected companies:
- Must maintain improved compliance standards to avoid stage escalation
- Continue adherence to listing requirements and disclosure norms
- Monitor trading patterns to remain in good standing

For market participants:
- Updated GSM stage information should be noted for trading decisions
- Lower stages may offer improved trading conditions

- Enhanced market accessibility for these securities
