## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This is a significant promoter stake sale in Hindustan Zinc Limited, one of India's largest zinc-lead-silver producers. The potential divestment of up to 1.58% of equity capital (including greenshoe) may create supply pressure on the stock price.

**Liquidity Impact**: The OFS mechanism provides an orderly method for large block sales, with separate days for retail and non-retail investors, helping to manage market impact and ensure fair price discovery.

**Investor Opportunity**: Retail investors will have dedicated access on T+1 day, along with non-retail investors carrying forward unallotted bids from T day.

**Promoter Holding Impact**: Successful completion of the full OFS (including greenshoe) would reduce Vedanta Limited's promoter holding in Hindustan Zinc Limited by 1.58%.

**Regulatory Compliance**: The OFS is structured in compliance with updated SEBI framework and stock exchange guidelines, ensuring transparency and investor protection.
