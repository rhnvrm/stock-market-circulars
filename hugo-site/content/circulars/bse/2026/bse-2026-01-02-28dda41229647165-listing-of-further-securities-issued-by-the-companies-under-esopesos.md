- **Notice Date**: January 2, 2026
- **Trading Commencement**: January 5, 2026 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (NA for all securities)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - The listing represents employee stock options being exercised and listed, which is a routine corporate action. The share quantities are relatively small compared to the outstanding shares of these companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal - While the shares add to the free float, the quantities are modest and will have negligible effect on trading volumes or liquidity.

**Dilution Impact**: Negligible to Low - For most companies, the additional shares represent minor dilution:
- Ather Energy: 433,842 shares
- AXIS Bank: 90,462 shares
- Bajaj Auto: 240,230 shares
- Max Estates: 43,898 shares
- Quick Heal Technologies: 15,352 shares
- South Indian Bank: 106,226 shares
- SpiceJet: 124,100 shares
- Yes Bank: 893,540 shares (highest dilution)

**Investor Consideration**: No lock-in restrictions mean these shares are immediately available for trading, potentially adding minor selling pressure, though this is typically priced into employee compensation schemes.
