## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The auction of Rs. 29,600 crores across 26 SDL securities represents significant borrowing activity by state governments, which will absorb liquidity from the debt market. The inclusion of multiple states and varying maturity profiles (2030-2056) provides investment options across the yield curve.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and institutional investors participating in government securities market need to prepare bids within the specified timeline. The non-competitive bidding facility allows retail and smaller investors to participate without competing with institutional bidders on price.

**State-wise Distribution**: Karnataka has the largest allocation (Rs. 6,000 crores across 4 securities), followed by Tamil Nadu (Rs. 6,000 crores across 5 securities) and Andhra Pradesh (Rs. 6,500 crores across 6 securities), indicating higher borrowing requirements from these states.
