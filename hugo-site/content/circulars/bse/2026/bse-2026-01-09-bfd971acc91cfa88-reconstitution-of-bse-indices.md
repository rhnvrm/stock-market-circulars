## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The reconstitution will affect passive funds and ETFs tracking the BSE IPO and BSE SME IPO Indices. The removal of 24 securities may trigger sell pressure from index funds that need to rebalance their portfolios before the effective date.

**Affected Securities**: Companies being dropped from the indices may experience reduced institutional ownership and potentially lower liquidity as passive funds divest their holdings. The BSE IPO Index will see removal of larger IPO companies including International Gemmological Institute India Limited, Dam Capital Advisors Limited, and Transrail Lighting Limited, while the BSE SME IPO Index will drop smaller SME listings.

**Investor Impact**: Passive investors and fund managers tracking these indices need to adjust their portfolios accordingly. Active traders may find short-term trading opportunities around the reconstitution date.
