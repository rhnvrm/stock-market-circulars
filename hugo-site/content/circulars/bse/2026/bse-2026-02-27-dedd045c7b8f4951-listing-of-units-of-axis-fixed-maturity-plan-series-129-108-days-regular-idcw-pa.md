## Impact Assessment

This is a routine mutual fund listing with minimal broader market impact. The scheme is close-ended with a short tenure of 108 days, relatively low interest rate risk, and moderate credit risk. With only 55,984 units listed, liquidity on the exchange is expected to be limited. The listing is relevant primarily to existing unit holders who may wish to exit via the exchange before maturity, and to trading members facilitating such transactions.
