## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. ESOP/ESOS issuances are routine corporate actions representing employee compensation and typically result in minor equity dilution. The number of shares issued is relatively small compared to the existing equity base of these companies.

**Trading Impact**: The newly listed shares will be immediately available for trading without lock-in restrictions, providing liquidity to employees who exercised their stock options.

**Investor Impact**: Negligible impact on existing shareholders given the small proportion of new shares relative to total outstanding equity across all listed companies.
