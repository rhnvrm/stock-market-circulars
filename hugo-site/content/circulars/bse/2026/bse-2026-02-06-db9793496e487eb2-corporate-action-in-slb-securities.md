**Operational Impact**: Market participants must adjust their SLB trading strategies to account for shut periods. This is particularly relevant for:
- Securities lenders who cannot lend shares during shut periods
- Borrowers who cannot initiate new borrowing transactions
- Trading desks managing SLB portfolios across multiple securities

**Investor Impact**: Minimal direct impact on regular equity investors. Primary impact is on institutional participants and arbitrageurs using SLB facilities.

**Duration**: Temporary impact spanning February 4-20, 2026, with different securities affected on different dates.
