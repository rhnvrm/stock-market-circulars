## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine corporate action affecting only holders of specific debentures of Muthoot Microfin Limited. The part redemption will reduce the outstanding principal amount of these debentures.

**Investor Impact:** Debenture holders on record as of January 16, 2026 will receive partial redemption proceeds along with accrued interest. Post-redemption, the face value per debenture will be reduced to Rs. 25,000, affecting the calculation of future interest payments and final redemption value.

**Trading Impact:** Minimal - Trading will continue with adjusted face value parameters from the effective date. Market participants need to account for the reduced face value in their trading and settlement processes.
