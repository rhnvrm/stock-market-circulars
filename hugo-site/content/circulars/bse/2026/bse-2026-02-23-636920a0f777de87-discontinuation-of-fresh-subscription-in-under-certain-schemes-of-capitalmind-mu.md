## Summary

Capitalmind Asset Management Private Limited and Capitalmind Trustee Private Limited have issued Notice cum Addendum No. 006/2025-26 to the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) of Capitalmind Arbitrage Fund. Effective 23rd February 2026, the IDCW-Reinvestment sub-option is discontinued. Investors may only avail the IDCW Pay-out facility going forward.

- Post-change, the IDCW Option will offer only the Pay-out sub-option/facility.

- Both Direct Plan and Regular Plan structures are retained; default plan remains "Direct Plan" when no broker code is stated.
- The scheme continues to maintain a common portfolio across all Plans/Options/Sub-options.
- Default option remains Growth Option if the investor has not indicated a preference.

## Regulatory Changes

The SID and KIM of Capitalmind Arbitrage Fund are amended to remove the IDCW-Reinvestment sub-option. The amended scheme features table reflects the removal of sub-option (b) — "Reinvestment of Income Distribution cum capital withdrawal (IDCW) option/facility" — leaving only sub-option (a) Pay-out as available under the IDCW Option.

## Compliance Requirements

- Existing investors enrolled in the IDCW-Reinvestment sub-option should review their investment instructions and update preferences if required before the effective date.
- Distributors and intermediaries should update client records and cease processing IDCW-Reinvestment transactions for this scheme from the effective date.

- **Addendum Reference:** Notice cum Addendum – SID/KIM No. 006/2025-26

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to existing and prospective investors of Capitalmind Arbitrage Fund who preferred the IDCW-Reinvestment sub-option. Such investors will need to switch to the IDCW Pay-out sub-option or the Growth Option. There is no broader market impact. The change does not affect the fund's investment objective, portfolio strategy, or fee structure.
