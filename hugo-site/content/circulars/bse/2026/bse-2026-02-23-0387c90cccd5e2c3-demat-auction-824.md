## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a routine operational circular under existing BSE bye-laws governing demat auction procedures for settlement shortfalls.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members who have open delivery obligations for the listed securities in Settlement No. 824 must participate in or monitor the auction process
- Buyers with unresolved delivery claims will receive shares or close-out proceeds as per BSE auction settlement rules
- Members should ensure proper reconciliation of their positions for all 47 listed securities

## Important Dates

- **Settlement Date:** 20 February 2026 (Settlement No. 824)
- **Circular Publication Date:** 23 February 2026
- Auction date and final settlement date to follow as per BSE's standard auction settlement schedule

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine demat auction notice with moderate market impact. Larger quantity lots such as Gokul Refoils (2668 shares), Vistar Amar (1001 shares), MOIL (1000 shares), Nippon India (500 shares), Quick Heal (496 shares), and Swan Corp (750 shares) may see some price pressure during the auction process. Blue-chip names like HCL Technologies, ITC, Eicher Motors, and ONGC have minimal quantities (1–140 shares) and are unlikely to experience material price movement. Overall market impact is limited to the specific auction lots.
