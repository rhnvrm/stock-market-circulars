## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that Fedders Electric and Engineering Ltd (Scrip Code: 500139) will be delisted from the Exchange effective Monday, March 02, 2026. The delisting follows a Resolution Plan approved by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Allahabad Bench, vide its order dated October 16, 2025. The company has confirmed compliance with all requirements stipulated under the NCLT order.

## Key Points

- Fedders Electric and Engineering Ltd (Scrip Code: 500139) is being delisted from BSE.

- The company has confirmed full compliance with the NCLT delisting requirements.
- Effective date of delisting: Monday, March 02, 2026.
- Trading members are advised to take immediate note of the delisting.

## Regulatory Changes

The delisting is mandated by the National Company Law Tribunal under its Resolution Plan framework (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code proceedings). This is an NCLT-directed delisting, not a voluntary or exchange-initiated action, and supersedes normal delisting procedures under SEBI Delisting Regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease trading in the equity shares of Fedders Electric and Engineering Ltd (Scrip Code: 500139) on or before the delisting effective date.

## Impact Assessment

The delisting of Fedders Electric and Engineering Ltd has a high impact on existing shareholders and trading members. Once delisted on March 02, 2026, the equity shares will no longer be tradable on BSE, eliminating exchange-based liquidity. Shareholders will need to explore alternative exit options as provided under the NCLT Resolution Plan. Trading members are urged to inform affected clients promptly and settle any outstanding positions before the delisting date.
