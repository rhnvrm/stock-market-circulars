title: Cancellation of Record Date for First Call and Resumption of Trading in PPS
  of ANNVRRIDHHI VENTURES LTD
---

## Summary

BSE has informed trading members that ANNVRRIDHHI VENTURES LTD (Scrip Code: 890229) has cancelled the Record Date of February 27, 2026 that was fixed for determining holders of Partly Paid Rights Equity Shares (PPS) eligible to receive the First Call notice. The company's Rights Committee rescinded its earlier resolution approving a First Call of Rs. 2.50 per partly paid-up equity share (face value Rs. 10 each). As a result, trading in the company's Partly Paid Shares will resume from March 2, 2026.

## Key Points

- The Rights Committee of ANNVRRIDHHI VENTURES LTD, at its meeting on February 26, 2026, resolved to rescind and withdraw its earlier resolution dated February 23, 2026 approving the First Call of Rs. 2.50 per partly paid-up equity share (face value Rs. 10 each).
- The Record Date of February 27, 2026, previously fixed for determining shareholders liable to pay the First Call, stands withdrawn.
- The cancellation was prompted by an internal review of the call schedule.
- Although a newspaper advertisement regarding the earlier Record Date was published on February 24, 2026, the Call Notice had not been dispatched and no call money had become due or payable.
- This notice is in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20260224-38 dated February 24, 2026.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. The cancellation reverses a previously announced corporate action (First Call on PPS) and restores the trading status of the Partly Paid Shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are required to take note of the cancellation of the Record Date for the First Call on PPS of ANNVRRIDHHI VENTURES LTD (Scrip Code: 890229).
- Members should update their systems and communications to reflect that no First Call is currently due or payable on these PPS.

## Important Dates

- **February 23, 2026:** Original Rights Committee resolution approving First Call of Rs. 2.50 per PPS.
- **February 24, 2026:** Newspaper advertisement published; BSE Notice No. 20260224-38 issued announcing Record Date.
- **February 26, 2026:** Rights Committee meeting rescinding the First Call resolution.
- **February 27, 2026 (Cancelled):** Record Date originally fixed for determining PPS holders for First Call.
- **March 2, 2026:** Resumption of trading in PPS of ANNVRRIDHHI VENTURES LTD (Scrip Code: 890229).

## Impact Assessment

The cancellation of the First Call record date primarily impacts existing holders of Partly Paid Rights Equity Shares (PPS) of ANNVRRIDHHI VENTURES LTD. Since no call money had become due or been dispatched, investors face no immediate financial obligation. Trading in the PPS, which was presumably suspended ahead of the record date, will resume from March 2, 2026, restoring normal market access for these securities. The broader market impact is limited to this specific scrip.
