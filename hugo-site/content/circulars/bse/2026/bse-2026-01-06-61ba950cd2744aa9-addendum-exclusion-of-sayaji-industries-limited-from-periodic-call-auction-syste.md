## Summary

BSE has issued an addendum to notice 20260105-10 regarding the exclusion of Sayaji Industries Limited from the Periodic Call Auction System (PCAS) mechanism. The exclusion will be effective from January 7, 2026, allowing the stock to trade under normal continuous trading mode.

## Key Points

- This is an addendum to earlier notice 20260105-10 dated January 5, 2026
- Sayaji Industries Limited (Scrip Code: 540728, ISIN: INE327G01024) will be excluded from PCAS mechanism
- The exclusion is effective from Wednesday, January 7, 2026
- Trading members can contact Mr. Parag Jain (Manager - Listing Compliance & Operations) for clarifications

## Regulatory Changes

The stock will move from Periodic Call Auction System (PCAS) trading mechanism to normal continuous trading mode. Under PCAS, stocks are traded through periodic call auctions at specified intervals, whereas exclusion allows the stock to trade continuously during market hours.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members of BSE are required to:
- Note the change in trading mechanism for Sayaji Industries Limited
- Ensure trading systems are updated to reflect the stock's exclusion from PCAS
- Contact the exchange for any clarifications needed

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 6, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 7, 2026 (Wednesday)
- **Previous Notice**: 20260105-10 dated January 5, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The exclusion from PCAS mechanism is generally positive for the stock as it indicates improved liquidity and trading activity. Stocks are placed under PCAS when they exhibit poor liquidity or price stability issues. Exclusion suggests the company has met the criteria for normal trading, potentially leading to:
- Increased trading opportunities for investors
- Better price discovery through continuous trading
- Improved market liquidity
- Enhanced market perception of the stock
