## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the closure of equity and equity derivatives segments on January 15, 2026
- Participants with equity derivatives contracts expiring on January 15, 2026 must prepare for the preponed expiry on January 14, 2026
- Commodity derivatives and EGR traders should adjust their trading schedules to accommodate evening-only sessions
- Review and download updated contract master files reflecting the expiry date changes

## Important Dates

- **January 12, 2026**: Notice date - Contract master files updated with modified expiry dates
- **January 14, 2026**: Preponed expiry date for equity derivatives contracts originally scheduled for January 15, 2026
- **January 15, 2026**: Trading holiday - Equity and equity derivatives segments closed all day; Commodity derivatives open 5:00 pm to 11:55 pm; EGR open 5:00 pm to 9:30 pm

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Complete closure of equity and equity derivatives segments affects all equity market participants. The preponing of derivatives expiry to January 14, 2026 will concentrate settlement activity and may increase volatility on that day.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to adjust their operational schedules and inform clients about the holiday. Risk management systems must account for the preponed expiry date. Commodity and EGR traders have limited access through evening sessions only, which may reduce liquidity and trading volumes in these segments.

**Participant Impact**: Retail and institutional investors cannot trade equity or equity derivatives. Commodity and precious metals traders have restricted access to markets during traditional trading hours.
