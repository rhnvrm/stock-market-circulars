## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants holding short positions in the listed securities must participate in or monitor the demat auction process
- Brokers/members are required to ensure delivery obligations are met in accordance with BSE settlement rules for Settlement No. 827
- Entities with failed delivery obligations for the listed scrips should refer to applicable BSE bye-laws and settlement procedures

## Important Dates

- **Auction Date / Settlement Date:** 25 February 2026
- **Settlement Number:** 827

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine demat auction notice with medium operational impact. The inclusion of heavily traded large-cap stocks such as ITC (164,800 shares), Reliance Industries (10,030 shares), and Infosys (2,400 shares) may cause minor price adjustments for the affected securities on auction day. The large quantity for Alstone Textiles (170,025 shares) and Indian Renewable Energy (62,100 shares) may have a relatively higher impact on those smaller/mid-cap counters. Overall market impact is limited as demat auctions are standard settlement mechanisms.
