  February 25, 2026

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular announcing changes to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework under the 5/15/30 Days ASM mechanism, effective February 25, 2026. Nine securities have been newly shortlisted, none have been moved to higher or lower stages within the framework, and twelve securities have been removed from the ST-ASM list.

## Key Points

- 9 securities newly added to Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework effective February 25, 2026
- No securities moved to a higher ASM stage
- No securities moved to a lower ASM stage
- 12 securities removed from the ST-ASM framework effective February 25, 2026
- 2 newly added securities are SME scrips (marked @): Justo Realfintech Ltd and Kizi Apparels Ltd
- 2 newly added securities are also on NSE's ST-ASM list (marked *): Akme Fintrade (India) Ltd and Dee Development Engineers Ltd
- Wanbury Ltd (524212) is moving out of ST-ASM due to inclusion in the ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure) Framework
- 1 SME scrip (Dindigul Farm Product Ltd) is moving out of ST-ASM

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies additional surveillance conditions (e.g., price bands, margin requirements) to securities exhibiting abnormal price or volume behaviour. This circular updates the composition of the framework:

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised ST-ASM list and apply applicable surveillance-related trading conditions (price bands, margin requirements) for newly added securities effective February 25, 2026
- Securities marked @ are SME scrips — relevant rules for SME segment apply
- Securities marked * are also shortlisted on NSE under ST-ASM
- Wanbury Ltd (524212) transitions to the ESM framework; members should refer to the applicable ESM circular for trading conditions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** February 25, 2026 — all additions to and removals from the ST-ASM framework take effect
- **Circular Date:** February 24, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine periodic update to BSE's ST-ASM surveillance framework. The impact is moderate and stock-specific:

- **Newly added securities** will face enhanced surveillance conditions such as tighter price bands and higher margin requirements, which may reduce liquidity and increase trading costs for these scrips
- **Removed securities** (excluding Wanbury Ltd) revert to normal trading conditions, potentially improving liquidity
- **Wanbury Ltd** faces continued surveillance under the stricter ESM framework, indicating elevated regulatory concern
- The inclusion of SME scrips (Justo Realfintech, Kizi Apparels) highlights ongoing surveillance of the SME segment
- No systemic or broad market impact is expected; effects are confined to the 21 specific securities listed
