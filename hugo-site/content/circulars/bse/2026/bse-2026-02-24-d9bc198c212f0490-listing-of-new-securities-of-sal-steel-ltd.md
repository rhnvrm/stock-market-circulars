## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 1,92,50,000 equity shares to the tradeable universe of S.A.L. Steel Ltd., representing a capital infusion at Rs. 18/- per share (total consideration: approximately Rs. 34.65 crore). However, since all newly listed shares are subject to a lock-in period until August 30, 2027, there is no immediate increase in free-float. Market impact on liquidity and price discovery is expected to be minimal in the short term. Post lock-in expiry, the release of these shares could exert selling pressure on the stock.
