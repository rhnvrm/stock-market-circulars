## Compliance Requirements

- The allotted shares are subject to a mandatory lock-in period and cannot be traded by the allottee (Promoters) until the lock-in expires.

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds approximately 95.24 lakh new equity shares to JSW Energy's tradeable universe, representing a moderate dilution event. However, since all newly listed shares are subject to a promoter lock-in until September 9, 2027, there is no immediate increase in free-float or selling pressure. Market impact is expected to be limited in the near term. The preferential allotment at Rs. 525/- per share indicates the price at which promoters participated, which may serve as a reference point for market sentiment.
