- All orders must comply with the new price band limits
- Risk management systems should be updated to reflect new parameters
- For clarifications, members may contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 28, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 29, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities with tighter bands (2-5%) will experience limited intraday price movement, potentially affecting liquidity. CHPL Industries Ltd with 2% band faces the most restrictive trading environment. Gabion Technologies India Ltd with 20% band experiences the most relaxed conditions.

**Market Participants**: Day traders and short-term traders in affected scrips need to adjust strategies. Institutional investors may face difficulty in building or exiting large positions in tightly banded securities.

**Liquidity**: Tighter price bands typically reduce trading volumes as price discovery is constrained within narrow ranges.
