## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements the existing GSM framework which applies progressive surveillance measures based on securities meeting specific criteria related to price volatility, trading patterns, or other market surveillance parameters.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors and traders must be aware of the GSM stage applicable to these securities
- Higher GSM stages typically involve stricter surveillance, including increased margin requirements, trading restrictions, or reduced position limits
- Market participants should review their holdings and positions in these securities
- Brokers must ensure appropriate risk disclosures to clients trading in GSM securities

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: January 27, 2026
- Effective Date: As per BSE surveillance framework implementation schedule (not specified in circular)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Securities in higher GSM stages face increased surveillance and may have higher margin requirements, potentially reducing liquidity and trading volumes. Stage IV securities face the most stringent restrictions.

**Investor Impact:** Existing investors in these securities should monitor their positions closely as GSM classification may affect price discovery and exit opportunities. New investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance conditions.

**Market Impact:** Limited overall market impact as these are primarily small-cap securities with specific surveillance concerns. The GSM framework helps protect investor interests through enhanced monitoring of securities with abnormal price movements or trading patterns.
