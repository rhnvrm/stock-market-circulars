## Summary

BSE has issued its updated Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) list under the 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework. Effective February 25, 2026, nine new securities have been shortlisted for inclusion, while twelve securities are being removed from the framework. No securities are moving to a higher or lower stage within the framework in this update.

## Key Points

- **9 securities** newly added to the ST-ASM 5/15/30 Days Framework effective February 25, 2026
- **12 securities** are being removed from the ST-ASM Framework effective February 25, 2026
- No securities are moving to a higher or lower ASM stage in this update (both lists are "Nil")
- Two newly added securities (Akme Fintrade, Dee Development Engineers) are shortlisted as per NSE
- Two newly added securities (Justo Realfintech, Kizi Apparels) are SME scrips
- One exiting security (Wanbury Ltd) is marked `$`, indicating it is moving out due to inclusion in the ESM Framework
- One exiting security (Dindigul Farm Product Ltd) is an SME scrip

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance conditions including higher applicable margins and periodic review of price/volume behaviour for shortlisted securities. Under Stage I, securities are subject to a 5-day surveillance window.

## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers and trading members must apply the applicable ST-ASM margin requirements for the newly shortlisted securities from February 25, 2026
- Clients holding or trading in newly shortlisted securities should be informed of enhanced surveillance conditions
- Securities exiting the framework (except Wanbury Ltd) revert to normal trading conditions; Wanbury Ltd transitions to ESM Framework conditions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** February 25, 2026 — all additions and removals from the ST-ASM framework take effect
- **Circular Date:** February 24, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The nine newly added securities will face enhanced surveillance with higher margin requirements under Stage I of the ST-ASM framework, which may reduce liquidity and increase trading costs for market participants in these scrips. Inclusion is typically triggered by unusual price or volume movement. The twelve securities exiting the framework (notably TVS Supply Chain Solutions and GE Power India among larger-cap names) will revert to standard trading conditions, potentially improving liquidity. Wanbury Ltd moves to the stricter ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure) framework, signalling continued regulatory concern. SME scrips (Justo Realfintech, Kizi Apparels) being brought under ST-ASM reflects BSE's broadening of surveillance to the SME segment.
