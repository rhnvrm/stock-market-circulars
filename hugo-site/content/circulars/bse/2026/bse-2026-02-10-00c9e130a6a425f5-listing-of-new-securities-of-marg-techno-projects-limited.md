## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of preferential allotment shares following warrant conversion for a single company. The 14 lakh shares represent new equity capital raised by the company.

**Liquidity Impact**: Limited immediate impact due to complete lock-in of all shares. 600,000 shares will become tradable after August 31, 2026, and remaining 800,000 shares after August 31, 2027.

**Dilution**: The new shares will cause dilution for existing shareholders but rank equally (pari-passu) in all respects.
