## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium impact limited to Shentracon Chemicals shareholders. The buyback at Rs. 0.50 per share (against face value of Rs. 10.00) indicates significant discount, suggesting potential delisting or consolidation activity. The offer size of 16.5 million shares represents a substantial portion that could impact trading volumes.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure their systems and UCC databases are updated for participating clients. Members must be familiar with iBBS/RTRMS platforms and ensure proper login credentials are active before the offer opening date.

**Investor Impact**: Eligible shareholders holding Shentracon Chemicals shares in demat form can participate through their trading members. The 12-day offer window provides adequate time for decision-making. Investors should note the significantly discounted offer price relative to face value.

**Contact Support**: BSE has provided comprehensive contact details for technical support (Trading Operations: 022-22728005, user.trdops@bseindia.com) and specific personnel for OTB module queries.
