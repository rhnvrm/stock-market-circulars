title: BSE Surveillance Measure for Securities under IBC - Effective March 02, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has issued its periodic update on the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework applied to companies undergoing Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Effective March 02, 2026, nine securities have been moved to Stage 0 (Receipt of Corporate Announcement/Disclosure), while no new securities have been added to Stage 1 or Stage 2. No securities have been excluded from the ASM-IBC framework in this update.

## Key Points

- **9 securities** newly moved to Stage 0 (IBC surveillance) effective March 02, 2026
- **Nil** new securities shortlisted under Stage 0, Stage 1, or Stage 2 in Annexure I
- **Nil** securities excluded from ASM-IBC framework
- Consolidated list in Annexure III covers all securities currently under IBC surveillance across all stages
- Securities marked `^` are Recommencement Scrips; securities marked `*` are as per NSE data

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements a routine update to BSE's ASM-IBC surveillance framework. Stage movements reflect changes in the insolvency resolution status of listed companies:

- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company
- **Stage 1**: Active insolvency resolution process under IBC
- **Stage 2**: Advanced/prolonged insolvency proceedings

No structural changes to the ASM-IBC framework itself have been announced.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and investors must note the revised surveillance status of the 9 newly added securities under Stage 0
- Securities under ASM-IBC are subject to enhanced surveillance conditions, including applicable trade-for-trade settlement and price band restrictions as per the relevant stage
- Market participants should monitor official BSE announcements for any further stage transitions for these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: March 02, 2026 — all stage changes and new additions come into force
- **Circular Date**: February 27, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Newly Added to Stage 0 (Annexure II) — effective March 02, 2026:**

The broader impact is limited to holders of these specific securities. Being placed under Stage 0 surveillance signals early-stage IBC proceedings, typically resulting in heightened regulatory scrutiny and potential trading restrictions. Investors in the affected companies should exercise caution and monitor corporate announcements closely. The absence of any Stage 1 or Stage 2 additions indicates no escalation in the severity of ongoing IBC cases this cycle.
