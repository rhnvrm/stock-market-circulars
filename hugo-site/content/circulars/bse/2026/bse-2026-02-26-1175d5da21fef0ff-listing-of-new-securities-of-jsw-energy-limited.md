## Impact Assessment

The listing of approximately 95.24 lakh new shares increases JSW Energy's total equity share count, marginally diluting existing non-promoter shareholders. Since the entire allotment is issued to Promoters and is locked in until September 2027, there is no immediate supply pressure in the market. The preferential allotment at Rs. 525/- per share signals promoter confidence in the company. Market impact is expected to be moderate, with the primary effect being a slight increase in promoter shareholding percentage.
