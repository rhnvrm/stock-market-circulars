## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt corporate action affecting holders of J.K. Cement Ltd's privately placed 7.90% NCDs maturing in March 2028. The part redemption reduces the outstanding face value per debenture to Rs. 50,000, which will affect the traded price and accrued interest calculations for this instrument. Impact is limited to institutional and HNI investors holding this specific NCD and does not affect J.K. Cement's equity shares. Trading members must ensure systems are updated before the effective date to avoid settlement discrepancies.
