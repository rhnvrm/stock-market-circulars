Impact is limited to holders of these specific debt instruments. The partial redemption reduces outstanding principal, lowering per-unit face values across all nine series. Trading members must ensure pricing and settlement systems reflect the updated face values from the effective date. Note: the circular text references "February 25, 2025" which appears to be a typographical error; the correct effective year based on the circular date is 2026.
