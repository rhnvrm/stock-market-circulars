## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must take note of the new securities and their distinctive numbers
- Trading systems should be updated to reflect the increased share capital for the listed companies
- Distinctive number ranges provided for each company's new issuance for tracking purposes

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 2, 2026
- **Trading Commencement Date:** February 3, 2026 (Tuesday)
- **Lock-in Expiry:** Not Applicable (NA) - no lock-in period for any securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The newly listed shares represent routine ESOP/ESOS conversions and are relatively small compared to the existing market capitalization of the companies involved. The absence of lock-in restrictions means shares are immediately tradable, but the quantities are not significant enough to materially impact liquidity or price discovery.

**Operational Impact:** Standard operational update for market participants to update their systems with new distinctive number ranges and increased share capital. No special trading arrangements or restrictions apply.

**Investor Impact:** Marginal dilution effect across all 7 companies. For large-cap stocks like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, the dilution is negligible given their substantial existing share base. Investors holding these securities should be aware of the slight increase in outstanding shares.
