## Regulatory Changes

**Existing Terms (Sr.4 of Schedule IX):**
- Gross Loans with DPD greater than 90 days as a percentage of AUM < 2.50%

## Impact Assessment

**Credit Quality Implications:**
The upward revision of covenant thresholds by 75 basis points (gross) and 75 basis points (net) suggests either anticipation of increased delinquencies or a need for greater operational flexibility. This may signal asset quality pressures in the microfinance/NBFC sector.

**Investor Impact:**
Debt investors should reassess credit risk profiles and monitor the company's actual DPD levels relative to the new thresholds. The covenant relaxation reduces the margin of safety but may prevent technical defaults.

**Market Perception:**
The revision may be viewed neutrally if proactive or negatively if reactive to deteriorating portfolio quality. Transparency in the company's rationale would be important for market confidence.

**Operational Flexibility:**
Provides Five-Star Business Finance Limited with additional room to manage its loan portfolio during periods of stress without breaching covenants.
