**Trading Impact**: Medium - The shift from Trade for Trade (T2T) segment to Rolling segment will change the settlement and trading mechanics for the stock. In T2T segment, buyers must take delivery and sellers must deliver shares, whereas in Rolling segment, the stock will be available for intraday trading and regular settlement cycles.

**Liquidity Impact**: Positive - Moving to Rolling segment typically improves liquidity as it removes T2T restrictions and allows for more flexible trading.

**Investor Impact**: Trading members and investors dealing in this scrip need to be aware of the changed trading mechanics and settlement procedures from the effective date.
