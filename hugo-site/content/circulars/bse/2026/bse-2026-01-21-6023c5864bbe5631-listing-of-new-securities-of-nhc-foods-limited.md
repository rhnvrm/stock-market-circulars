## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The listing increases the paid-up capital of NHC Foods Limited by 2.1 crore shares. However, with the entire allotment under lock-in until July 30, 2026, there will be no immediate selling pressure or liquidity impact. The preferential allotment to non-promoters at Rs. 1.25 per share indicates capital raising activity but the lock-in period ensures market stability.
