## Summary

Invesco Mutual Fund has announced changes to the Scheme Information Documents (SIDs), Key Information Memorandums (KIMs), and Statement of Additional Information (SAI). Key changes include reduction in minimum application amounts from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100, reduction in minimum redemption amounts from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100, and introduction of daily and weekly SIP frequencies for select schemes.

## Key Points

- Minimum application/switch-in amount reduced from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100 for six equity and hybrid schemes
- Minimum redemption/switch-out amount reduced from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100
- Daily SIP introduced with minimum Rs. 20 for Invesco India Gold ETF Fund of Fund and Invesco India Multi Asset Allocation Fund
- Weekly SIP introduced with minimum Rs. 100 for Invesco India Gold ETF Fund of Fund
- Daily and weekly SIP frequencies now available under both Growth and IDCW options
- Daily SIP requires minimum 60 installments, weekly SIP requires minimum 12 installments
- Changes apply to Invesco India Business Cycle Fund, Flexi Cap Fund, Large & Mid Cap Fund, Midcap Fund, Smallcap Fund, and Multi Asset Allocation Fund

## Regulatory Changes

This is a scheme-level operational change and does not constitute a regulatory mandate. The Asset Management Company (AMC) has exercised its discretion to modify investment thresholds and SIP options to enhance accessibility for retail investors. The AMC reserves the right to change or modify features of daily and weekly frequency SIP in the future.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors can now invest with lower minimum amounts starting from Rs. 100 for lump sum investments
- Existing investors are not required to take any action
- New investors and those making additional purchases can benefit from the revised lower thresholds
- Investors opting for daily SIP must commit to minimum 60 installments
- Investors opting for weekly SIP must commit to minimum 12 installments
- All other existing terms and conditions of SIP remain unchanged

## Important Dates

No specific effective date mentioned in the circular. The changes are expected to be implemented following the notice-cum-addendum issuance on January 28, 2026.

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact on Retail Investors**: The reduction in minimum investment amounts from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100 significantly lowers the entry barrier for small retail investors, making mutual fund investments more accessible. The introduction of daily SIP with Rs. 20 minimum further democratizes systematic investing.

**Enhanced Investment Flexibility**: The availability of daily and weekly SIP frequencies under both Growth and IDCW options provides investors with greater flexibility in aligning investments with cash flows.

**Market Impact**: Limited direct market impact as these are scheme-level operational changes. However, the lower thresholds may attract new retail participants to mutual funds, potentially increasing AUM for Invesco schemes over time.

**Operational Considerations**: Investors should note that daily and weekly SIPs require higher commitment in terms of number of installments (60 and 12 respectively) compared to traditional monthly SIPs.
