## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Notice Date | 23 February 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

The rights issue is a moderate corporate action affecting existing shareholders of Bhandari Hosiery Exports Ltd. The ratio of 4 shares for every 5 held at Rs. 2.56 represents a significant dilutive event for non-participating shareholders. The full issue price being payable on application (no partly paid structure) simplifies the settlement. Market impact is limited to this specific scrip; trading members must be prepared for price adjustment on the ex-rights date (25 February 2026).
