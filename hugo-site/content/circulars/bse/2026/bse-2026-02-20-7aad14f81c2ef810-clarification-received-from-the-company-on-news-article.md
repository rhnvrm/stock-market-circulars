## Summary

Waaree Energies Ltd. (BSE: 544277, NSE: WAAREEENER) issued a clarification under Regulation 30(11) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 in response to a news article published in The Hindu on February 19, 2026, titled "Andhra secures Waaree Energies' battery giga-factory with ₹8,175 crore investment." The company confirmed that the underlying board decision was already disclosed to stock exchanges on October 1, 2025, and that no unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI) is pending disclosure.

## Key Points

- On October 1, 2025, the Board of Directors approved an increase in manufacturing capacity of Lithium-Ion Advanced Chemistry Storage Cells and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) from 3.5 GWh to 20 GWh.
- Additional capital expenditure of approximately ₹8,000 crores was approved for the wholly owned subsidiary, Waaree Energy Storage Solutions Private Limited.
- The company is in active discussions with the Government of Andhra Pradesh and certain other state governments for setting up the proposed greenfield manufacturing facility.
- The company confirmed no UPSI is pending disclosure to stock exchanges.
- Share price movement noted in the media is described as market-driven.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular is a clarificatory intimation under Regulation 30(11) of SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015, which requires listed entities to respond to stock exchange queries regarding news articles that may have a bearing on share price.

## Compliance Requirements

- Waaree Energies has affirmed compliance with Regulation 30 of SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015.
- The company undertakes to keep stock exchanges informed of any material developments regarding the greenfield facility as required under applicable regulations.
- No immediate compliance action required from investors or market participants.

## Impact Assessment

This circular has **medium market relevance** as it reaffirms a significant long-term capital allocation decision — a 20 GWh BESS manufacturing facility with ~₹8,000 crore capex — while confirming the company is actively negotiating site selection with state governments including Andhra Pradesh. The clarification reduces information asymmetry following media coverage and confirms no undisclosed price-sensitive information exists. Investors tracking India's energy storage and battery manufacturing theme may note this as confirmation of Waaree's strategic intent in the BESS segment through subsidiary Waaree Energy Storage Solutions Private Limited. No immediate trading or compliance impact; the broader capex and capacity expansion story remains an ongoing development.
