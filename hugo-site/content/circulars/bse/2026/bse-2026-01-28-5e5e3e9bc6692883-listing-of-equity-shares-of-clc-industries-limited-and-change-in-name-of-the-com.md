## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Existing Shareholders**: Public shareholders faced a 95% dilution of holdings, retaining only 1 share for every 100 shares held. Existing promoters lost 100% of their stake.

**Market Positioning**: Listing in T Group (speculative category) and mandatory Trade-to-Trade segment indicates higher risk profile and restricted liquidity with no intraday trading allowed.

**Ownership Structure**: Significant change in control with Successful Resolution Applicant receiving 95% of post-restructuring equity (98.75 lakh shares out of 103.95 lakh total), with majority locked-in for one year.

**Trading Implications**: Limited liquidity expected due to T2T segment restrictions, lock-in period for 90% of shares, and T Group classification. Market lot of 1 share allows smaller retail participation.

**Corporate Action**: Complete corporate restructuring under insolvency proceedings represents fresh start for company with new management and capital structure.
