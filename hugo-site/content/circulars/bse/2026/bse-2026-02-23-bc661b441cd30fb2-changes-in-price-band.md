title: BSE Price Band Revisions for 42 Scrips Effective February 24, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for 42 equity scrips effective February 24, 2026, under Notice No. 20260223-52 issued by the Surveillance department. The majority of affected scrips have been moved to a 5% price band, with Akme Fintrade (India) Ltd and Udayshivakumar Infra Ltd set at 10%, and Citurgia Biochemicals Ltd set at 20%.

## Key Points

- 42 scrips are affected by this price band revision, effective February 24, 2026.
- 39 scrips revised to a **5% price band**.
- 2 scrips revised to a **10% price band**: Akme Fintrade (India) Ltd (544200) and Udayshivakumar Infra Ltd (543861).
- 1 scrip revised to a **20% price band**: Citurgia Biochemicals Ltd (506373).
- Action taken by BSE Surveillance department; queries to be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com.

## Regulatory Changes

Price bands for the listed scrips have been revised from their existing levels as a surveillance measure. Price bands limit the maximum intraday price movement (up or down) permitted for a scrip on the exchange. Tightening bands (e.g., to 5%) restricts volatility, while widening (e.g., to 20%) allows more price discovery room.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised price bands for all 42 scrips and ensure orders placed from February 24, 2026 onward are within the new limits.
- No action required from listed companies; this is an exchange-level trading parameter change.
- Members with clarifications should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 23, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 24, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The revision to predominantly 5% price bands signals BSE Surveillance's intent to curb excessive speculation or volatility in these scrips. Traders in affected securities will face tighter intraday movement limits, which may reduce liquidity and widen bid-ask spreads. The widening of Citurgia Biochemicals to 20% may indicate a relaxation to allow normal price discovery. The 10% band for Akme Fintrade and Udayshivakumar Infra represents a moderate restriction. Overall market impact is limited to the 42 affected scrips; broader indices are unaffected.
