## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 4,477,612 shares to the tradeable equity base of Suven Life Sciences Ltd; however, since all newly listed shares are locked in until August 30, 2026, there is no immediate increase in free-float. Market impact is expected to be limited in the near term. Post lock-in expiry, the additional supply could exert modest downward pressure on the stock price depending on market conditions at that time.
