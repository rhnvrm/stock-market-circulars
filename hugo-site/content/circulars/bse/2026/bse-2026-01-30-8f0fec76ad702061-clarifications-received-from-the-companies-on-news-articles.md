## Summary

BSE circular dated January 30, 2026, containing clarifications from three listed companies in response to news articles published in various media outlets. Vedanta Limited clarified incorrect reporting about an arbitral award on BALCO shares, Kothari Industrial Corporation Limited provided clarification on potential acquisition of Kickers brand, and NMDC Limited responded to media queries. All companies confirmed no pending material disclosures.

## Key Points

- **Vedanta Limited (VEDL)**: Clarified that news report on Economic Times about arbitral award declaring BALCO share transfer as void is incorrect. No such arbitral award exists.
- The matter relates to a long-standing dispute with Government of India on 'call option' under Shareholders' Agreement, already disclosed in Annual Report Notes to Accounts.
- Vedanta's approach to Delhi High Court is in normal course of legal proceedings with no new material development.
- **Kothari Industrial Corporation Limited (KICL)**: Responded to The Hindu news article about talks to buy French footwear brand Kickers.
- Decision to buy Kickers brand requires Board approval and completion of due diligence and statutory formalities.
- No regulatory or legal proceedings initiated or pending. Appropriate disclosures will be made after Board approval and finalization of binding agreement.
- **NMDC Limited**: Provided clarification (content incomplete in source document).
- All companies confirmed no pending information requiring disclosure under SEBI LODR Regulations 2015.

## Regulatory Changes

- Companies are required to confirm whether any information is pending disclosure that may impact price/volume behavior of scrip.

## Important Dates

- **January 30, 2026**: Date of clarifications submitted by companies to BSE.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The clarifications are routine compliance responses with no new material information disclosed. Vedanta clarified that a news report was incorrect and there is no new development. Kothari confirmed that any acquisition decision is subject to Board approval and due diligence, with no binding agreement yet. No immediate impact on trading or investor sentiment expected.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Companies are following standard disclosure protocols under SEBI regulations. The clarifications help prevent misinformation and maintain market integrity by correcting or providing context to media reports.
