## Impact Assessment

This circular directly impacts trading members and custodians participating in the takeover of NIRBHAY COLORS INDIA LTD. The offer price of Rs. 10.00 per share (equal to face value) and the size of up to 14,79,700 shares indicate a relatively small-cap acquisition. Participants must ensure platform readiness on iBBS (https://ibbs.bseindia.com/) and RTRMS (https://rtrms.bseindia.com/) before the opening date of 26th February 2026. Non-compliance with UCC registration or demat requirements could result in ineligibility to participate. The extended session on the last day for Take-up (until 4:00 p.m.) warrants specific attention for custodians.
