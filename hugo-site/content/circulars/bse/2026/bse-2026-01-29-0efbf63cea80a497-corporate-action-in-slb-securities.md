## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects 10 securities across different sectors including industrial, shipping, financial services, and FMCG. Market participants engaged in SLB activities for these securities must adjust their strategies.

**Operational Impact:** SLB participants cannot execute lending or borrowing transactions during shut periods, potentially affecting hedging and arbitrage strategies. The spin-off action for Genus Power Infrastructures requires additional attention due to the foreclosure mechanism.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders as of record dates will be eligible for dividends or spin-off benefits. SLB market liquidity for these securities will be temporarily reduced during shut periods.
