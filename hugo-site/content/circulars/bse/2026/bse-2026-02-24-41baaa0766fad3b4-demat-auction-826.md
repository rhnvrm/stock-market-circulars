## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers with buying positions in the listed scrips must participate or await the auction outcome to receive their securities or close-out proceeds.
- Selling brokers who failed delivery are subject to auction cost differentials and applicable penalties as per BSE settlement rules.
- All participants must comply with SEBI and BSE settlement regulations governing demat auctions.

## Important Dates

- Settlement No.: 826
- Auction Date: February 24, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine, low-impact operational notice. The demat auction mechanism ensures buying brokers receive their securities or equivalent close-out compensation when sellers default on delivery. The quantities involved are relatively small for most scrips. The larger lots (DEE DEVELOPM: 25,638; GUJARAT TOOL: 13,598; Blue Jet Healthcare: 10,686; R M DRIP AND: 5,136) may see minor price impact during the auction session. No systemic or broad market impact is anticipated.
