## Impact Assessment

This partial redemption affects holders of these specific PTC series issued by India Universal Trust. The reduction in face values reflects the return of principal to investors as part of the structured amortization schedule of these pass-through certificates. Trading members dealing in these debt securities need to adjust their valuation and trading systems accordingly. The impact is limited to participants in these specific debt instruments and does not affect the broader equity market.
