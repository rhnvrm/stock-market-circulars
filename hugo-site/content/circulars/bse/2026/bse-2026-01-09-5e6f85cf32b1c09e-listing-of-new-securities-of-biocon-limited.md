## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of 171.28 million shares represents a significant increase in Biocon's equity capital, though the immediate market impact is limited due to the 6-month lock-in period. The shares are issued at a substantial premium (Rs. 400.78), indicating the transaction valued Biocon at the issue price level.

**Liquidity Impact**: Post lock-in expiry on July 13, 2026, these shares will become tradable, potentially increasing free float and liquidity in Biocon stock.

**Ownership Impact**: The preferential allotment to non-promoters through share swap suggests a strategic transaction, likely involving acquisition or merger activity. The substantial number of shares issued will dilute existing shareholders' holdings.
