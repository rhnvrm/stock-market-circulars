## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure applies enhanced monitoring and trading restrictions to securities showing unusual price movements or volumes over 5/15/30 day periods. Securities can be placed in different stages with progressively stricter surveillance measures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the surveillance status changes for affected securities
- Trading in ST-ASM securities may be subject to additional margins and trade-to-trade settlement
- Investors should review their positions in affected securities
- Brokers must ensure compliance with applicable surveillance framework requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 07, 2026 - All ST-ASM framework changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The ST-ASM framework is designed to curb excessive speculation and protect investor interests by imposing additional surveillance on securities with abnormal price or volume movements. Securities under ST-ASM typically face reduced liquidity due to additional margin requirements and trade-to-trade settlement. Investors holding these securities may experience higher trading costs and reduced ease of exit. The removal of 8 securities from the framework may improve their trading liquidity, while the 9 newly added securities will face enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions.
