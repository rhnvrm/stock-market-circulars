  Stock Split
---

## Summary

BSE has announced mandatory adjustments to all Futures & Options contracts on Angel One Ltd (Scrip Code: 543235, Derivatives Asset Code: ANOL) in accordance with SEBI guidelines for corporate action adjustments. The adjustments are triggered by a 10:1 stock split (sub-division of one equity share of Rs. 10 each into ten equity shares of Rs. 1 each), with the Record Date fixed as February 26, 2026. All contract adjustments will be applied at end of day on February 25, 2026.

## Key Points

- Angel One Ltd has announced a stock split in the ratio of 10:1 (one share of Rs. 10 → ten shares of Rs. 1)
- Record Date for the stock split is **February 26, 2026**; ex-date is also **February 26, 2026**
- Adjustments to all available F&O contracts on ANOL will be applied at **end of day on February 25, 2026**
- The adjustment factor is **10** (calculated as split ratio A/B = 10/1)
- Strike prices will be **divided by 10** (e.g., 1950 → 195, 2000 → 200)
- Market lot will be **multiplied by 10** (existing lot of 250 → revised lot of 2500)
- Open positions will be **multiplied by 10**
- Futures prices will be **divided by 10**, rounded to nearest tick size

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- All trading members in the Equity Derivatives Segment must take note of the revised contract specifications effective February 26, 2026
- Members should update their systems to reflect the new strike prices, market lot size (2500), and adjusted futures prices before trading commences on February 26, 2026

## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Circular Date | February 20, 2026 |
| Contract Adjustment Effective (EOD) | February 25, 2026 |
| Ex-Date / Record Date | February 26, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

This adjustment has a **high operational impact** on all participants holding open Futures & Options positions in Angel One Ltd. The 10:1 adjustment factor will significantly alter the nominal values of strike prices and futures prices (divided by 10) while increasing the market lot size and position counts tenfold. Net economic exposure remains equivalent, but systems, risk models, and order management parameters must be updated accordingly. Members who fail to account for these adjustments may face erroneous margin calculations or mispriced orders on the ex-date. The increased market lot (250 → 2500 shares) may also affect liquidity dynamics and margin requirements at the contract level.
