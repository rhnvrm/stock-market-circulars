title: Clarifications from Reliance Infrastructure and Jindal Poly Films on News Articles
---

## Summary

Two companies — Reliance Infrastructure Limited and Jindal Poly Films Limited — submitted clarifications to BSE in response to rumour verification queries dated February 26, 2026, regarding news articles appearing in public media.

## Key Points

- Reliance Infrastructure (BSE: 500390, NSE: RELINFRA) clarified that the ED Provisional Attachment Order reported in media on February 25, 2026, pertains to Reliance Communications Limited under PMLA, 2002 — not to Reliance Infrastructure — and therefore no disclosure is warranted from the company under applicable regulations.
- Jindal Poly Films Limited clarified that the NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal), New Delhi, dismissed their appeal (Company Appeal (AT) No. 47 of 2026) on February 26, 2026.
- The dismissed NCLAT appeal was filed against an NCLT order dated February 5, 2026; the original filing and NCLT admission were already disclosed to exchanges on February 6, 2026.
- Jindal Poly Films confirmed it has not entered into any negotiations with the counterparty as of the date of the letter.
- Both companies stated they are unaware of any company-specific information that could explain unusual movement in their trading price or volume.

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. Both responses are confirmatory/clarificatory disclosures under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- Both companies have complied with rumour verification obligations under the Listing Regulations by responding to BSE's surveillance queries.
- Jindal Poly Films has undertaken to promptly notify exchanges of any future developments related to the NCLAT/NCLT matter that fall within the purview of the Listing Regulations.
- Reliance Infrastructure confirmed no further disclosure is required under applicable regulations as the enforcement action does not pertain to the company.

## Important Dates

- February 5, 2026: NCLT Principal Bench, New Delhi passed order in the matter of Jindal Poly Films and Mr. Ankit Jain & Ors.
- February 6, 2026: Jindal Poly Films disclosed NCLT filing and admission to stock exchanges.
- February 25, 2026: ED Press Release regarding Provisional Attachment Order (pertaining to Reliance Communications) issued.
- February 26, 2026: BSE rumour verification queries sent to both companies; NCLAT dismissed Jindal Poly Films appeal (Company Appeal (AT) No. 47 of 2026); both companies submitted clarifications.

## Impact Assessment

**Reliance Infrastructure (RELINFRA):** The clarification is likely to be viewed positively by the market as the company has clearly distanced itself from the ED enforcement action, which relates solely to Reliance Communications Limited. No financial or operational impact on Reliance Infrastructure is indicated.

**Jindal Poly Films (JINDALPOLY):** The NCLAT dismissal of the company's appeal is a notable legal development. Since the underlying matter involves corporate governance and potential change-of-control disputes (implied by the involvement of Mr. Ankit Jain & Ors.), the dismissal could have implications for the company's legal strategy and investor sentiment. The company has pledged ongoing disclosure compliance.
