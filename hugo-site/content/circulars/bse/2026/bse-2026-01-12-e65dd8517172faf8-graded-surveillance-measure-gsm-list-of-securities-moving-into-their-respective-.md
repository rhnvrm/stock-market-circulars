title: 'GSM Framework: 13 Securities Moving to Surveillance Stages'

## Summary

BSE has released the updated list of securities moving into different stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. A total of 13 securities are being moved to enhanced surveillance stages: 9 securities to Stage I, 3 securities to Stage II, and 1 security to Stage III. The GSM framework applies progressive trading restrictions to securities exhibiting unusual price movements or trading patterns.

## Key Points

- 9 securities moving to GSM Stage I: Triliance Polymers, RSC International, Manraj Housing Finance, Polycon International, Hari Govind International, Mega Fin India, Simplex Mills Company, Yaan Enterprises, and Shashank Traders
- 3 securities moving to GSM Stage II: Santosh Fine Fab, Binny Mills, and LCC Infotech (as per NSE)
- 1 security moving to GSM Stage III: Krishna Filament Industries
- Securities marked with special symbols may move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in ESM Framework (#) or IBC Framework ($)
- LCC Infotech classification is aligned with NSE

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework implements progressive surveillance measures with increasing levels of restrictions as securities move through stages. Stage I represents the initial surveillance level, Stage II involves enhanced monitoring and trading restrictions, and Stage III applies the most stringent surveillance measures. Securities in higher GSM stages face additional disclosure requirements and trading limitations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must adhere to stage-specific restrictions for each listed security
- Enhanced margin requirements apply to securities in GSM stages
- Investors should be aware of reduced liquidity and increased trading costs for GSM securities
- Market participants must comply with applicable price bands and position limits for GSM securities

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: January 12, 2026
- Effective Date: Implementation timeline to be confirmed by BSE

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The inclusion of 13 securities in GSM stages will result in reduced trading volumes and liquidity for affected stocks. Investors holding these securities may face challenges in executing large orders due to enhanced surveillance measures.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their risk management systems to account for additional margin requirements and trading restrictions. Surveillance measures aim to protect investors from potentially risky securities while maintaining market integrity.

**Investor Impact:** Retail and institutional investors should exercise heightened caution when trading GSM securities. Stage progression indicates deteriorating quality parameters or concerning trading patterns that warrant regulatory oversight.
