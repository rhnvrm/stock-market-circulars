**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a preferential allotment to promoters which increases the total share capital by approximately 1.89 lakh shares. The shares are subject to a lock-in period until August 15, 2027, meaning they cannot be traded during this period, thus having no immediate impact on trading volumes or price discovery. The allotment strengthens promoter holding and provides capital infusion to the company. Investors should note the increased share base when calculating valuations.
