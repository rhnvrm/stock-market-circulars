## Summary

BSE has updated the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework, announcing the movement of 11 securities into their respective GSM stages. Two securities (Garware Synthetics Ltd and Gopal Iron & Steels Company Gujarat Ltd) are moving to Stage 0 due to inclusion in the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework. Six securities are moving to Stage I, one to Stage II, and two to Stage III.

## Key Points

- 2 securities moving to GSM Stage 0 (moved lower due to ESM Framework inclusion)
- 6 securities moving to GSM Stage I
- 1 security moving to GSM Stage II
- 2 securities moving to GSM Stage III
- Securities marked with (#) are moving lower in GSM due to ESM Framework inclusion
- Securities marked with ($) would move lower in GSM due to IBC Framework inclusion

## Regulatory Changes

Securities are being reclassified under the GSM framework based on surveillance criteria. Securities moving to lower GSM stages due to ESM inclusion indicates a shift to more stringent surveillance mechanisms.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors should be aware that securities in higher GSM stages face additional trading restrictions
- Market participants must comply with applicable trading conditions for each GSM stage
- Brokers should ensure clients are informed about the surveillance status of these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 9, 2026 (circular date)

## Impact Assessment

The movement of securities across GSM stages affects trading conditions, with higher stages typically imposing stricter requirements such as 100% upfront margin, periodic call auctions, or price bands. Securities moving to ESM Framework face even more stringent surveillance. Investors in these 11 securities should review the applicable trading restrictions and margin requirements for their respective stages.
