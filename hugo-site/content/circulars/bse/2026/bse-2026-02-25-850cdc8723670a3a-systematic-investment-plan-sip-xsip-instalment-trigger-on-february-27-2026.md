## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is an operational adjustment to the standard SIP/XSIP instalment trigger schedule to accommodate the calendar constraints of February 2026.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Members**: Must notify their clients to maintain sufficient bank balances ahead of February 27, 2026
- **Members using own payment aggregators**: Must ensure fund collection from investor bank accounts to ICCL bank accounts is completed within the validity period of collection orders
- **Investors**: Must ensure adequate balance in bank accounts linked to SIP/XSIP mandates before February 27, 2026

## Important Dates

- **February 27, 2026 (Friday)**: Revised instalment trigger date for SIP/XSIP dues originally scheduled for 28th, 29th, and 30th of February 2026
- **February 28, 2026 (Saturday)**: 4th Saturday — non-business day, original due date for some instalments

## Impact Assessment

This notice has a moderate operational impact on mutual fund distributors and investors using the BSE StAR MF platform. Investors with SIP/XSIP mandates scheduled for the 28th, 29th, or 30th of the month will have their February 2026 instalment debited one day earlier than usual. Failure to maintain adequate bank balances could result in instalment failures, potentially affecting investment continuity. Members and payment aggregators must coordinate timely fund collection to avoid processing issues.
