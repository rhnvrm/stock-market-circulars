## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of six securities into higher stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. The securities are being moved to Stages I, II, III, and IV based on surveillance criteria. GSM is a framework designed to enhance market surveillance and investor protection for securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or other risk indicators.

## Key Points

- Six securities are being moved to higher GSM stages effective from the specified date
- Iykot Hitech Toolroom Ltd. is moving to GSM Stage I
- Photon Capital Advisors Ltd. is moving to GSM Stage II
- Peoples Investments Ltd. and Cresanto Global Limited are moving to GSM Stage III
- Avasara Finance Limited and Popees Cares Limited are moving to GSM Stage IV
- Securities marked (#) move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- Securities marked ($) move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in IBC Framework

## Regulatory Changes

The affected securities will be subject to increased surveillance measures corresponding to their respective GSM stages. Higher GSM stages typically involve stricter trading restrictions, including:

- Additional disclosure requirements
- Trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday trading)
- 100% upfront margin requirements
- Price bands and other trading restrictions
- Enhanced reporting obligations for market participants

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with GSM stage-specific requirements for the affected securities
- Clients trading in these securities must provide 100% upfront margins as applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Securities moving to higher GSM stages will face increased trading restrictions, potentially reducing liquidity and trading volumes. Stage IV securities face the most stringent restrictions.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding these securities should be aware of enhanced margin requirements and settlement obligations. Intraday trading may not be permitted depending on the stage.

**Market Sentiment:** Movement to higher GSM stages may negatively impact market sentiment for these securities as it signals heightened regulatory scrutiny and potential risk factors.

**Broker Impact:** Brokers must update their risk management systems to ensure compliance with stage-specific requirements and margin collection procedures.
