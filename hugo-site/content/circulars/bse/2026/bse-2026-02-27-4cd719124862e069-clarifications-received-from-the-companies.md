## Impact Assessment

The impact of this circular is minimal. These are standard BSE Surveillance clarification responses and do not indicate any adverse regulatory findings, penalties, or material undisclosed events. Investors and market participants should note that all three companies have reaffirmed their disclosure compliance. The price and volume movements cited remain unexplained beyond being described as market-driven, which may warrant independent investor diligence but does not constitute a regulatory action or risk event.
