## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

Market participants are requested to note the updated share counts and distribution numbers for the six affected securities. No additional compliance action is required from traders or investors.

- **Notice Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Effective Trading Date:** February 27, 2026 (Friday)
- **Lock-in Expiry:** Not applicable (NA) for all listed shares

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. These are routine ESOP/ESOS-related listings representing employee compensation share issuances. The share quantities are relatively small compared to the total issued capital of each company. The largest issuance is Aditya Birla Capital Limited at 971,589 shares, followed by Axis Bank at 263,239 shares. No lock-in period means shares are immediately tradeable, but volumes are unlikely to cause significant price movement given the scale.
