- Scrip Code: 539854
- Current Group: XT
- New Group: T
- Effective Date: January 19, 2026
- Notice Number: 20260116-21

## Regulatory Changes

The scrip will be subject to T Group trading rules instead of XT Group rules. The T Group typically indicates trade-to-trade settlement with no intraday trading, stricter surveillance, and delivery-based settlement only.

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

The migration from XT to T Group indicates enhanced surveillance measures. This typically results in reduced liquidity as intraday trading is restricted and all trades must result in delivery. Traders and investors holding positions in Halder Venture Limited should be aware that trading will be subject to stricter controls and settlement requirements from January 19, 2026 onwards.
