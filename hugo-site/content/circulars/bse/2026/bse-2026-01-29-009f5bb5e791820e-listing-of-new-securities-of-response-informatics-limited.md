## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing of preferentially allotted shares to promoters following warrant conversion. The market impact is minimal as the shares are locked-in for approximately 19 months and represent a small portion of issued capital. The preferential allotment to promoters indicates continued promoter commitment to the company. No immediate trading activity is expected due to lock-in restrictions.
