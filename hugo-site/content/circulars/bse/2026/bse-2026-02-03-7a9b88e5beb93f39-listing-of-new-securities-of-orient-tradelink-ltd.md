## Key Points

- 3,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each issued at a premium of Rs. 6/- (total issue price: Rs. 16/-)
- Shares issued to non-promoters on preferential basis through warrant conversion
- Trading permitted from Wednesday, February 4, 2026

No regulatory changes introduced by this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are informed of the new listing and should ensure proper settlement procedures for the newly listed securities.

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Dates**: August 12-13, 2025 (1,00,000 shares on 12/08/2025; 2,00,000 shares on 13/08/2025)
- **Trading Commencement**: February 4, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry**: August 31, 2026 (all 3,00,000 shares)

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this is a routine listing notification for a single company's preferential allotment. The relatively small size of the issue (3 lakh shares at Rs. 16/- totaling Rs. 48 lakhs) and the lock-in period until August 2026 mean minimal immediate trading volume impact. This is a standard corporate action following warrant conversion procedures.
