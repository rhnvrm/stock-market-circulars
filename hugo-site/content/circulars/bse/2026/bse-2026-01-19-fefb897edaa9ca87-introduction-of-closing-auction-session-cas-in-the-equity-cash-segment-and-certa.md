title: Introduction of Closing Auction Session (CAS) in the Equity Cash Segment and
  certain modifications in the Pre-Open Auction Session
---

## Summary

SEBI has introduced a Closing Auction Session (CAS) in the equity cash segment to determine closing prices through an auction mechanism, replacing the current Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) method. Initially, CAS will apply to stocks on which derivative contracts are available. The CAS will operate as a separate 20-minute session from 3:15 PM to 3:35 PM, featuring a random close mechanism and distinct order entry periods. This change aligns Indian markets with global practices and aims to provide a fair, transparent closing price used for derivatives settlement, index computation, and mutual fund NAV determination.

## Key Points

- CAS introduced to replace VWAP method for determining closing prices of derivative stocks
- 20-minute auction session from 3:15 PM to 3:35 PM on all trading days
- Phased implementation: Initially applicable only to stocks with derivative contracts
- Four distinct phases: Reference price calculation (5 mins), Order entry for limit and market orders (5 mins), Limit orders only with random close (5 mins), Order matching (5 mins)
- Random closure between 3:28 PM to 3:30 PM to prevent gaming
- Equity derivatives segment continues until 3:40 PM
- Post-close session shifts to 3:50 PM - 4:00 PM for trades at closing price
- Remaining securities continue with VWAP-based closing price from last 30 minutes of CTS
- Global alignment: Major jurisdictions use auction-based closing price determination
- Benefits include aggregated liquidity, reduced tracking error for passive funds, and transparent price discovery

## Regulatory Changes

**Closing Price Determination Method:**
- Derivative stocks: Transition from VWAP (last 30 minutes) to auction-based CAS pricing
- Non-derivative stocks: Continue with VWAP method until further notice

**Market Structure Changes:**
- New CAS session created as separate trading session
- Modified trading timeline with extended active hours
- Introduction of random close mechanism in auction session
- Special trading sessions will also use CAS for closing price determination

**Order Types and Entry Periods:**
- Session 1 (3:15-3:20 PM): Reference price calculation and transition
- Session 2 (3:20-3:25 PM): Both limit and market orders accepted
- Session 3 (3:25-3:30 PM): Only limit orders accepted, no modification/cancellation of market orders, random close in last 2 minutes
- Session 4 (3:30-3:35 PM): Order matching period

## Compliance Requirements

**Stock Exchanges:**
- Implement CAS infrastructure and systems
- Configure random close mechanism (3:28 PM - 3:30 PM window)
- Update trading systems to support phased rollout for derivative stocks
- Maintain VWAP calculation for non-derivative securities
