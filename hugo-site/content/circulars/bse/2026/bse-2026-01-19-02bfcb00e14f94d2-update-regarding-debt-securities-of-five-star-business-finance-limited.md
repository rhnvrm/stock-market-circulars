## Impact Assessment

**Credit Quality Implications**: The 30% increase in permissible DPD >90 days ratios (from 2.50% to 3.25% gross, and 1.50% to 2.25% net) suggests potential asset quality stress. This covenant relaxation may indicate that Five-Star Business Finance Limited was approaching or at risk of breaching the original thresholds.

**Investor Considerations**: Debenture holders face increased credit risk as the company now has more headroom for non-performing assets. The revision may reflect deteriorating portfolio quality in the microfinance/NBFC lending sector.

**Market Impact**: Limited broader market impact as this applies specifically to Five-Star Business Finance Limited's debt securities, though it may signal sector-wide asset quality pressures in the NBFC space.
