## Impact Assessment

This update has moderate operational impact on clearing members, custodians, and banks that provide collateral to ICCL. Entities using banks not present on the revised list must make alternative arrangements. The inclusion of foreign banks (Barclays, Citibank, DBS, Deutsch Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan, Mizuho, MUFG, Standard Chartered, Sumitomo Mitsui) and AU Small Finance Bank broadens collateral options. Risk and settlement teams should cross-check current collateral arrangements against the updated list immediately.
