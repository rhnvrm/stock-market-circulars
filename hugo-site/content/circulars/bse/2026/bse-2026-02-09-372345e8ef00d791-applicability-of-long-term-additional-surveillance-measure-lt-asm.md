title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has released updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective February 10, 2026. Two securities are being newly shortlisted into the LT-ASM framework: Delta Industrial Resources Ltd and Stratmont Industries Ltd. Additionally, Neopolitan Pizza And Foods Ltd will continue in the framework but move to Stage II ASM. No securities are being moved to lower stages, directly placed in Stage IV, or exiting the LT-ASM framework.

## Key Points

- 2 new securities added to Long Term ASM Framework: Delta Industrial Resources Ltd (Scrip Code: 539596) and Stratmont Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 530495)
- 1 security moving to higher stage: Neopolitan Pizza And Foods Ltd (Scrip Code: 544269) moving to Stage II ASM
- No securities moving to lower ASM stages
- No securities directly placed in Stage IV under LT-ASM Framework
- No securities exiting the LT-ASM Framework
- All changes effective from February 10, 2026
- Consolidated list includes 19+ securities across various ASM stages (I, III shown in partial data)

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework continues to operate as a surveillance mechanism for securities exhibiting concerning trading patterns or volatility. Securities in this framework are subject to additional surveillance measures with varying degrees of restrictions based on their assigned stage (I through IV). Movement between stages reflects changes in the surveillance risk profile of the securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with the surveillance measures applicable to securities in LT-ASM framework
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting requirements apply to securities under different ASM stages
- Members should note the stage assignments for affected securities and apply appropriate trading controls
- Securities in higher stages typically face more stringent trading restrictions including price bands and trading frequency limits

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 10, 2026 - All changes to LT-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of two new securities to the LT-ASM framework and the stage elevation of one security indicates BSE's continued vigilance over securities with unusual trading characteristics. This will result in increased scrutiny and potentially restricted trading conditions for Delta Industrial Resources Ltd and Stratmont Industries Ltd.

**Trading Impact**: Neopolitan Pizza And Foods Ltd moving to Stage II ASM will face enhanced surveillance measures compared to Stage I, which may include tighter price bands, reduced trading frequency, or additional disclosure requirements.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in the affected securities should be aware of the surveillance framework implications, which may include reduced liquidity, higher volatility restrictions, and potential for further stage movements based on future trading patterns.
