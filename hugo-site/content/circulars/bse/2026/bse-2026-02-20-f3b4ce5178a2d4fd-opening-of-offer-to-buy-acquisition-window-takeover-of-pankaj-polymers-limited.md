## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes are introduced. This offer is made pursuant to existing SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 — specifically Regulation 3(1) (acquisition of shares/voting rights) and Regulation 4 (indirect acquisition). No statutory approvals are currently required; if any become applicable prior to completion, the offer will be subject to those approvals.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Public Shareholders of PPL** must review this Letter of Offer and decide whether to tender their shares during the Tendering Period via the Acquisition Window.
- Shareholders who have recently sold their PPL shares should forward this Letter of Offer and accompanying Form of Acceptance cum Acknowledgement and Transfer Deed to the relevant Stock Exchange member through whom the sale was effected.
- Shareholders requiring clarifications should consult their Stock Broker, Investment Consultant, or the Manager/Registrar to the Offer.

## Important Dates

- **Price Revision / Offer Withdrawal Deadline:** Monday, February 23, 2026 (1 working day prior to commencement of Tendering Period)
- **Tendering Period:** Commences on or after February 24, 2026 (exact schedule to be announced)
- Any upward revision in Offer Price or Offer Size will be announced in the same newspapers as the original Detailed Public Statement; revised price applies to all shares validly tendered during the Tendering Period.

## Impact Assessment

**For PPL Shareholders:** This is a significant event requiring immediate attention. Shareholders have the opportunity to exit at ₹40 per share during the Tendering Period. The offer is unconditional with respect to minimum acceptance, meaning all validly tendered shares (up to the offer size) will be purchased.

**Market Impact:** The open offer at ₹40/share sets a floor reference price for PPL equity. Shareholders should compare this price against the prevailing market price and historical trading range to evaluate the attractiveness of tendering.

**Acquirer Profile:** Two of the four acquirers (Vikas Garg and Rahul Nagar) are associated with Kredmint, suggesting a strategic financial/fintech interest in PPL. The combined acquisition of 26% alongside any prior holdings could result in a significant change in PPL's ownership structure.

**No Regulatory Hurdles:** No statutory approvals are currently required, reducing execution risk for this offer.
