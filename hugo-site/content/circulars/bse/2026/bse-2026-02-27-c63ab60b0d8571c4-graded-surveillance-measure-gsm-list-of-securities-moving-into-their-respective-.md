## Summary

BSE has notified the movement of 4 securities into their respective Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages effective from this circular. Three securities are placed into GSM Stage II and one into GSM Stage III, reflecting concerns over their financial fundamentals and trading patterns.

## Key Points

- **Nibe Ordnance and Maritime Ltd** (Scrip Code: 512091, ISIN: INE425H01016) moved to **GSM Stage II**
- **Rishab Special Yarns Ltd** (Scrip Code: 514177, ISIN: INE351D01013) moved to **GSM Stage II**
- **Madhur Industries Ltd** (Scrip Code: 519279, ISIN: INE110C01015) moved to **GSM Stage II**
- **Yuranus Infrastructure Ltd** (Scrip Code: 536846, ISIN: INE156M01017) moved to **GSM Stage III**
- Securities marked (#) may be placed at a lower GSM stage due to inclusion in the ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure) Framework
- Securities marked ($) may be placed at a lower GSM stage due to inclusion in the IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) Framework

## Regulatory Changes

The Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework places securities with poor financial fundamentals and/or unusual price-volume movements under progressively stricter trading conditions. Higher GSM stages (e.g., Stage III vs Stage II) entail more stringent restrictions such as reduced price bands, mandatory trade-for-trade settlement, and additional margin requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Brokers and trading members** must ensure clients are aware of the GSM status and associated trading restrictions for the listed securities.
- **Investors** holding or intending to trade in these securities should note the applicable stage-wise restrictions before executing transactions.
- **Exchanges and depositories** are to enforce the trading conditions applicable to the respective GSM stages.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** 27 February 2026
- The GSM stage designations are effective as communicated in this circular; trading members should refer to BSE for the exact applicability date of restrictions.

## Impact Assessment

Investors and traders in Nibe Ordnance and Maritime Ltd, Rishab Special Yarns Ltd, and Madhur Industries Ltd (all moving to Stage II) and Yuranus Infrastructure Ltd (moving to Stage III) will face increased trading restrictions. Stage III imposes more severe constraints than Stage II, making Yuranus Infrastructure Ltd the most affected. The overall market impact is limited to these four scrips, but existing holders may face reduced liquidity and higher costs of trading. This circular serves as a regulatory alert for retail and institutional participants to exercise caution.
