title: Resumption of Trading in Caspian Corporate Services Ltd After Share Consolidation
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the resumption of trading in the equity shares of Caspian Corporate Services Ltd (Scrip Code 534732) effective January 13, 2026, following a share consolidation from Re.1/- to Rs.10/- per share. A new ISIN number has been assigned for the consolidated shares, and trading members are advised to exercise caution when entering rates due to the face value change.

## Key Points

- Trading to resume on January 13, 2026 (DR-797/2025-2026)
- Share consolidation from Re.1/- fully paid up to Rs.10/- fully paid up
- New ISIN: INE176N01039 (replacing previous ISIN)
- Market lot: 1 (One) share
- Trading members must exercise abundant precaution when mentioning rates due to 10x face value increase
- New ISIN valid for transactions on or after January 13, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The equity shares of Caspian Corporate Services Ltd have undergone a consolidation where 10 shares of Re.1/- each have been consolidated into 1 share of Rs.10/- each. This represents a 1:10 reverse split. The company has been assigned a new ISIN number (INE176N01039) to reflect the consolidated share structure.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number (INE176N01039)
- Trading members must exercise abundant precaution when entering bid/ask prices to account for the 10x face value change
- Members should ensure their trading terminals reflect the correct face value of Rs.10/- per share
- Market lot of 1 share should be configured in trading systems

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 7, 2026
- **Trading Resumption Date**: January 13, 2026
- **New ISIN Effective Date**: January 13, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The resumption of trading after share consolidation will affect all existing shareholders and traders of Caspian Corporate Services Ltd. The 10-fold increase in face value means the share price will appear proportionally higher, which could lead to confusion or trading errors if members do not adjust their systems and processes accordingly.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their internal systems to reflect the new ISIN, face value, and market lot. There is a significant risk of erroneous trades if members input prices based on the old Re.1/- face value instead of the new Rs.10/- face value.

**Reference**: This notice continues from Exchange Notice No. 20251223-37 dated December 23, 2025, which likely announced the initial suspension of trading for the consolidation process.
