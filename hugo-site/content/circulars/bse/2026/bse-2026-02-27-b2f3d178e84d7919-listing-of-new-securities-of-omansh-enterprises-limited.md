## Impact Assessment

This circular has a limited market impact as it pertains solely to Omansh Enterprises Limited (Scrip Code: 538537). The listing adds 1,25,00,000 new equity shares to the tradable pool on BSE from March 02, 2026. However, the entire allotment is locked in until April 30, 2027, so there is no immediate increase in free-float supply. Existing shareholders should note the pari-passu ranking of these new shares and the lock-in restrictions applicable to them.
