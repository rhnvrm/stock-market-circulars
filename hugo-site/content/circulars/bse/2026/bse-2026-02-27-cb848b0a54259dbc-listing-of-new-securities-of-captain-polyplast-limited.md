## Important Dates

| Event | Date |

## Impact Assessment

The listing of 2,50,000 additional shares represents a modest increase in the tradeable float of Captain Polyplast Limited. However, since all newly listed shares are under lock-in until September 15, 2026, there is no immediate increase in freely tradeable supply. Market impact is expected to be minimal. Existing shareholders should be aware of the dilution from this preferential allotment via warrant conversion.
