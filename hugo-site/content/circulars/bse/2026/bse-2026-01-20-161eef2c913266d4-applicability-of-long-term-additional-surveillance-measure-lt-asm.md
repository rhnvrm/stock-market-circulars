## Summary

BSE has updated the list of securities under the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective January 21, 2026. Two new securities have been added to the framework: Acceleratebs India Ltd and Best Eastern Hotels Ltd. Additionally, Trescon Ltd will continue in the LT-ASM framework but will be moved to Stage II ASM. The circular provides consolidated lists of all securities currently under various ASM stages.

## Key Points

- 2 new securities added to Long Term ASM Framework: Acceleratebs India Ltd (Scrip Code: 543938, ISIN: INE0POP01017) and Best Eastern Hotels Ltd (Scrip Code: 508664, ISIN: INE553F01035)
- Trescon Ltd (Scrip Code: 532159, ISIN: INE088D01011) moved to Stage II ASM while continuing in LT-ASM framework
- No securities moved to lower ASM stages
- No securities moved directly to Stage IV under LT-ASM framework
- No securities removed from LT-ASM framework
- Consolidated list shows 20+ securities under various ASM stages (I, II, III, IV)
- Securities marked with asterisk (*) in consolidated list have specific notations (e.g., Ather Energy Ltd, Axiscades Technologies Ltd)

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework continues to be applied to securities that meet specific surveillance criteria. The framework operates in multiple stages (I through IV) with increasing levels of surveillance and trading restrictions. Securities can move between stages based on their performance and compliance with market regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of securities under LT-ASM framework and their respective stages
- Trading in LT-ASM securities may be subject to additional margins, price bands, or other restrictions depending on the stage
- Investors should exercise caution when trading in securities under surveillance measures
- Brokers and trading members must ensure clients are informed about surveillance measures applicable to these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 21, 2026 - New additions and stage movements become applicable
- **Circular Date**: January 20, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of securities in the LT-ASM framework typically results in:

- **Trading Impact**: Reduced liquidity and higher volatility due to surveillance measures
- **Margin Requirements**: Potentially higher margin requirements for trading these securities
- **Price Discovery**: Trading restrictions may affect normal price discovery mechanisms
- **Investor Sentiment**: Negative perception as surveillance measures indicate concerns about price movements or corporate actions
- **Market Participants**: Brokers and investors need to adjust their trading strategies and risk management for affected securities

The framework is designed to protect investor interests by identifying and monitoring securities with abnormal price movements or unusual trading patterns. Movement to higher stages (like Trescon Ltd moving to Stage II) indicates continued surveillance concerns.
