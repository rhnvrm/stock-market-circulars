## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. The issuance represents a small capital raise through warrant conversion to non-promoters. The lock-in period extending until July 31, 2026 ensures these shares cannot be immediately traded, preventing dilution pressure. The preferential issue mechanism is routine for raising capital from strategic investors. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new distribution numbers and lock-in restrictions.
