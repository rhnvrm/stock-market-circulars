This is a routine listing announcement with minimal market-wide impact. The listing affects only Krishival Foods Ltd. and its shareholders who participated in the rights issue. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new scrip details. The partly paid-up nature means shareholders will need to pay the remaining Rs. 6.50/- per share on future calls as determined by the company's Board. Investors should be aware of the future payment obligation and the proportionate dividend entitlement based on paid-up value.
