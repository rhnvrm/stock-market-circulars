## Impact Assessment

### Corporate Impact
- Complete change in ownership structure with 100% promoter exit
- Significant dilution for existing public shareholders (from 10.42 crore shares to 50,000 shares)
- New controlling interest through Successful Resolution Applicant (95% of post-restructuring equity)

### Trading Impact
- Placement in XT Group indicates enhanced surveillance due to corporate action
- Trade-to-Trade segment means no intraday trading; delivery-based only
- Special Pre-Open Session applicable for price discovery
- 90% of shares under lock-in until January 2027, limiting free float to approximately 1,00,000 shares

### Investor Considerations
- Company emerged from insolvency proceedings under IBC framework
- Restricted trading environment with T2T and XT classification
- Limited liquidity due to substantial lock-in and small free float
- Market participants should exercise caution given corporate debtor history

### Regulatory Significance
- Example of successful resolution under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016
- Demonstrates NCLT-approved restructuring leading to relisting
- Market surveillance measures in place through XT Group and T2T classifications
