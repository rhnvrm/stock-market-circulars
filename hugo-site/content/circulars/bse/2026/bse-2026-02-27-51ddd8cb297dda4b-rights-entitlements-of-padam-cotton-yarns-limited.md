## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform all clients about the commencement of RE trading, including the ISIN (INE448D20017), and clarify that REs are not ordinary shares of the company.
- Contract notes and bills for RE purchases must prominently include a disclaimer stating that purchasing REs only grants the right to participate in the ongoing Rights Issue or to renounce the REs before the issue closes.
- Trading members must ensure clients are aware that unsubscribed and unrenounced REs will lapse after the Issue Closing Date.

## Important Dates

- **February 27, 2026**: BSE notice issued
- **March 2, 2026**: Commencement of RE trading; Rights Issue opens
- **March 4, 2026**: Last day for trading in Rights Entitlements (renunciation window closes)
- **March 9, 2026**: Rights Issue closes; unrenounced/unsubscribed REs lapse after this date

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a moderate and targeted impact, primarily affecting existing shareholders of Padam Cotton Yarns Limited who have received Rights Entitlements. Trading members need to update their systems to handle the new RE scrip (PADAM-RE) and ensure client communication and contract note disclaimers are in place. The short three-day trading window (March 2–4) for renunciation requires prompt action from eligible shareholders. Broader market impact is limited given the company's small-cap nature and the routine character of the notice.
