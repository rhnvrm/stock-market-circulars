The QIP has resulted in significant capital raise for Biocon Ltd., with over 112 million shares issued at Rs. 368.35 per share, translating to approximately Rs. 4,150 crores. This represents a material dilution for existing shareholders but provides substantial capital to the company. The shares being pari-passu ensures equal rights with existing equity holders.
