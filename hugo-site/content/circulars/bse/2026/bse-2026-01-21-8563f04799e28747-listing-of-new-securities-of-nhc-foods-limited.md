- **Trading Commencement**: January 22, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing of 21 million preferential allotment shares represents an increase in the equity base of NHC Foods Limited. The shares are locked-in until July 30, 2026, which limits immediate trading activity. As these shares were issued to non-promoters, there may be limited impact on promoter shareholding. The preferential allotment at Rs. 1.25 per share indicates the pricing at which institutional or strategic investors were willing to participate. Overall market impact is minimal as this is a routine corporate action for capital raising.
