## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a company-specific listing event involving preferential allotment of 47.50 lakh shares. The lock-in period until July 31, 2026 prevents immediate supply pressure on the stock. The shares increase the total outstanding equity of RDB Infrastructure and Power Limited and will impact dilution calculations for existing shareholders. No broader market implications beyond this specific scrip.
