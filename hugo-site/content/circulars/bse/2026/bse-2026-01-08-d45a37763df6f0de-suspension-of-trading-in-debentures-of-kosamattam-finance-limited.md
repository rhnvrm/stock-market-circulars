---

## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in two series of non-convertible debentures issued by Kosamattam Finance Limited, effective January 15, 2026. The suspension is necessitated by the company's record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these specified debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies to two NCD series: INE403Q08134 (Code: 936448) and INE403Q08142 (Code: 936450)
- Record date set for January 15, 2026
- First series involves both redemption and interest payment
- Second series involves redemption only
- Circular issued under notice number 20260108-16
- Reference number: DR-799/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action notification for debt securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealing in the specified debentures from January 15, 2026
- Members should update their trading systems to reflect the suspension
- No transactions should be executed in INE403Q08134 (936448) and INE403Q08142 (936450) from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** January 8, 2026 (circular date shows January 6, 2025 - likely typographical error)
- **Record Date:** January 15, 2026
- **Trading Suspension Date:** January 15, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of Kosamattam Finance Limited's non-convertible debentures. This is a routine corporate action with minimal market-wide impact. Investors holding these securities will receive their interest payments and/or redemption proceeds as per the terms. The suspension prevents trading during the record date determination period, which is standard practice for debt securities undergoing redemption. The action affects only two specific debt instruments and does not impact the broader equity or debt markets.
