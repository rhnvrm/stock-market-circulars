## Summary

BSE published clarifications from three listed companies responding to news articles under Regulation 30 of SEBI LODR Regulations 2015. Vedanta Ltd. clarified an incorrect report about arbitral award on BALCO shares. Kothari Industrial Corporation Ltd. clarified that talks to acquire French footwear brand Kickers are preliminary and subject to board approval and due diligence. NMDC Ltd.'s clarification was included but content appears incomplete in the source document.

## Key Points

- **Vedanta Ltd. (VEDL)**: Denied news report claiming arbitral award declaring BALCO share transfer as void; confirmed matter relates to long-standing dispute with Government of India on call option under Shareholders' Agreement already disclosed in Annual Report
- **Kothari Industrial Corporation Ltd. (KICL)**: Confirmed discussions regarding acquisition of Kickers brand are preliminary; any decision subject to Board approval, due diligence, and statutory formalities
- **NMDC Ltd.**: Clarification document included but content incomplete in source material
- All companies confirmed no pending material information requiring disclosure to stock exchanges
- All companies reiterated compliance with SEBI Listing Regulations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This circular contains company responses to exchange queries under existing Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must provide clarifications when stock exchanges seek information on news articles that may impact price/volume behavior
- Companies must confirm whether any information is pending disclosure under Regulation 30
- Companies must commit to continued compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations for material event disclosures

## Important Dates

- **January 30, 2026**: Date of BSE email seeking clarifications and date of company responses

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. All three companies explicitly stated no new material developments requiring disclosure and no price-sensitive information pending.

**Vedanta**: Clarified existing dispute already disclosed in financial statements; no new arbitral award exists.

**Kothari Industrial**: Confirmed acquisition talks are preliminary and non-binding; material disclosure will follow only after Board approval and binding agreements.

**NMDC**: Impact assessment not possible due to incomplete source content.

Overall impact on stock prices and trading volumes expected to be negligible as clarifications confirm no material undisclosed events.
