**Market Impact:** High - The buyback of 4.14% of equity capital at a premium price of ₹655 per share (versus ₹5 face value) signals strong cash position and management confidence. This corporate action will reduce outstanding shares and potentially increase earnings per share for remaining shareholders.

**Shareholder Impact:** High - Participating shareholders will receive ₹655 per share in cash. Small shareholders have reserved category ensuring proportionate participation. The buyback provides an exit opportunity at the specified price and may support market price of shares.

**Capital Structure Impact:** Moderate - Deployment of ₹58.5 crores (24.68-24.81% of equity and reserves) will reduce free reserves and equity capital, altering the company's capital structure. This represents a significant return of capital to shareholders.

**Liquidity Impact:** The tender offer mechanism ensures organized buyback process through stock exchanges with Manager and Registrar facilitation, minimizing market disruption while providing liquidity to shareholders on proportionate basis.
