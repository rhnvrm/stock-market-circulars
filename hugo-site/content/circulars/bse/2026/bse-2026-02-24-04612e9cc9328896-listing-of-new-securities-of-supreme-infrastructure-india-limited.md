## Summary

The shares are ranking pari-passu with existing equity shares of the company.

## Key Points

- **Total new shares listed:** 7,10,37,388 equity shares of Rs. 10/- face value each
- **Issue price:** Rs. 86.94/- per share (face value Rs. 10/- + premium Rs. 76.94/-)
- **Issued to:** Promoter and Non-Promoter on a preferential basis
- **Date of allotment:** July 3, 2025
- **Trading commences:** February 25, 2026
- **Distribution numbers:** 25698373 to 96735760
- **Pari-passu** with existing equity shares of the company

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification pursuant to a preferential allotment already completed on July 3, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are informed to note the lock-in restrictions on the newly listed shares. Shares under lock-in are not available for trading until the respective lock-in expiry dates.

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** July 3, 2025
- **Trading Effective From:** February 25, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry Dates:**
  - 3,68,64,504 shares (Dist. Nos. 25698373–62562876): locked in until **September 30, 2027**
  - 96,83,541 shares (Dist. Nos. 62562877–72246417): locked in until **September 30, 2026**
  - 2,44,89,343 shares (Dist. Nos. 72246418–96735760): locked in until **September 29, 2026**

## Impact Assessment

The listing of approximately 71 million new shares on a preferential basis increases the total share capital of Supreme Infrastructure India Limited. However, the majority of the newly listed shares (approx. 71.2% — over 50.5 million shares) are subject to lock-in until late September 2026 or September 2027, which significantly limits any immediate dilution impact on the free float. The free-float addition on February 25, 2026 is effectively nil until lock-in periods expire. Market participants should monitor the lock-in expiry dates as potential supply events.
