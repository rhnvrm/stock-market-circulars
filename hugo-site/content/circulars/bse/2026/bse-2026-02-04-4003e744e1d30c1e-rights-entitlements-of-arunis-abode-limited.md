## Impact Assessment

This circular has moderate impact limited to ARUNIS ABODE LIMITED shareholders and Trading Members handling the company's securities. Existing shareholders receive tradable rights that can be renounced during the 3-day window (Feb 09-11) or exercised during the 8-day Rights Issue period (Feb 09-16). The short renunciation window requires prompt action from shareholders wishing to trade their entitlements. Trading Members must ensure proper client communication and disclaimer inclusion in contract notes to maintain regulatory compliance.
