## Impact Assessment

The introduction of F&O contracts on these four securities expands derivative trading opportunities for market participants. The inclusion of recent IPO companies (Premier Energies, Swiggy, Waaree Energies) alongside established Bajaj Holdings indicates BSE's focus on providing derivative products across both new-age and traditional companies. The varying market lot sizes reflect the different price ranges and liquidity profiles of the underlying securities. Trading members will need to update their systems with the new contract specifications before trading commences on January 30, 2026.
