## Summary

BSE has declared January 15, 2026 as a trading holiday for Currency Derivatives Segment (covering Currency Derivatives and Interest Rate Derivatives products), New Debt Segment – Reporting, Settlement and Trading (NDS-RST), and Tri Party Repo segments. This is a partial modification to the previously announced trading holidays for 2026 and is necessitated by the Municipal Corporation Elections scheduled in Maharashtra on that date.

## Key Points

- Trading holiday declared for January 15, 2026
- Affects Currency Derivatives Segment (Currency Derivatives products and Interest Rate Derivatives products)
- Affects NDS-RST (New Debt Segment – Reporting, Settlement and Trading)
- Affects Tri Party Repo segment
- Partial modification to Exchange Notice 20251223-12 dated December 23, 2025
- Reason: Municipal Corporation Election in Maharashtra
- No trading will take place on January 15, 2026 in the affected segments

## Regulatory Changes

This circular partially modifies the previously announced trading holiday calendar for 2026 (Notice 20251223-12 dated December 23, 2025) by adding January 15, 2026 as an additional trading holiday for specific market segments.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must note that the Exchange will remain closed on January 15, 2026
- No trading activities should be planned for the affected segments on this date
- Members should refer to the original notice 20251223-12 dated December 23, 2025 for the complete trading holiday calendar

## Important Dates

- **January 15, 2026**: Trading holiday for Currency Derivatives Segment, NDS-RST and Tri Party Repo segments
- **Reference Date**: December 23, 2025 (Original trading holiday calendar notice)

## Impact Assessment

The trading holiday will affect market participants operating in Currency Derivatives (including both currency and interest rate derivatives), debt market reporting and settlement operations (NDS-RST), and tri-party repo transactions. Market participants should adjust their trading and settlement schedules accordingly. The impact is limited to one trading day and affects specific segments only, not the equity cash market or equity derivatives segments.
