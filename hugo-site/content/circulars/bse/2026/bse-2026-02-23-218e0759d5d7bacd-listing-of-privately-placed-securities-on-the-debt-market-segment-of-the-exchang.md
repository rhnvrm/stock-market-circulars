## Impact Assessment

Low market impact. This is a routine operational circular notifying trading members of new debt instrument listings. The listings expand the available instruments on the BSE Debt Segment but carry no direct implications for equity market participants. The high credit ratings (A1+ across all issuers) indicate minimal credit risk. Navi Finserv's relatively higher rate of 8.50% p.a. compared to the others (7.09%–7.72%) may reflect a minor risk premium for that issuer. The Reliance Retail Ventures CP is the largest by quantity (35,000 units), implying a notional issuance size of approximately Rs. 1,750 crore.
