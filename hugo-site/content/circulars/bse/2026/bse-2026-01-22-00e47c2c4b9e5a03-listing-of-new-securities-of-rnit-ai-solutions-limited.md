## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification with limited market impact. The preferential allotment increases the equity base of Rnit Ai Solutions Limited by approximately 47.33 lakh shares. The lock-in period until February 2027 ensures these shares cannot be traded freely for over one year, limiting immediate liquidity impact. The issuance under an NCLT-approved resolution plan suggests the company underwent corporate insolvency resolution proceedings, and these shares represent strategic investor participation in the company's restructuring.
