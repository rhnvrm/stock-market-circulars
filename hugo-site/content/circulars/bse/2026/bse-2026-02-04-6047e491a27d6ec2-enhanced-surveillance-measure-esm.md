## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework continues to identify securities with abnormal price movements or concerns. Securities under ESM are subject to additional trading restrictions and surveillance. The framework operates in stages, with higher stages indicating increased surveillance intensity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors and market participants must be aware of ESM status when trading these securities
- Securities under ESM typically have additional margin requirements and trade-to-trade settlement
- Market participants should exercise enhanced due diligence for ESM securities
- Trading members must ensure compliance with ESM framework requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 05, 2026 - New ESM additions and stage changes become effective

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities newly added to ESM or moved to higher stages will face stricter trading conditions including higher margin requirements and potential trade-to-trade settlement. This may reduce liquidity and increase volatility for affected stocks.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance status, which indicates regulatory concerns about price movements or other factors. Additional margins and trading restrictions may apply.

**Market Impact**: The ESM framework helps maintain market integrity by identifying and monitoring securities with unusual characteristics. The consolidated list of 29+ securities under ESM represents a small fraction of overall market but requires focused attention from regulators and investors.
