- **February 20, 2026**: Rights Issue closes; last date for subscription/renunciation
- **After February 20, 2026**: Unexercised REs will lapse and be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects existing shareholders of DR LALCHANDANI LABS LIMITED who hold Rights Entitlements and need to decide whether to subscribe to the rights issue, renounce their entitlements in the market, or let them lapse.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update systems to handle DLCL-RE scrip (code 751078, ISIN INE871Z20013) with market lot of 4000 shares on T+1 settlement. Contract note generation systems must include mandatory disclaimers for RE purchases.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders must act within the 14-day renunciation window (Feb 4-17) or subscribe by February 20, 2026. Failure to act will result in loss of rights value as REs will be extinguished. The 4000-share market lot may limit accessibility for smaller investors during renunciation trading.
