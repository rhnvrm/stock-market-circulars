---

## Summary

BSE has issued a notice (No. 20260224-48) informing trading members that ECAP EQUITIES LIMITED has fixed 27 February 2026 as the Record Date for early redemption of its Non-Convertible Debentures (scrip code 975500, ISIN INE468N08043). Trading members are instructed not to deal in these debentures from 27 February 2026 onwards.

## Key Points

- ECAP EQUITIES LIMITED has fixed a Record Date of 27 February 2026 for Early Redemption of its NCDs.
- The affected debenture series is **EEL-GSEC-12-3-27-PVT** (ISIN: INE468N08043, Scrip Code: 975500).
- Trading members are advised to cease all dealings in the above debentures effective 27 February 2026.
- The circular reference for this action is DR-830/2025-2026.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This is an operational notice under existing BSE debt segment rules governing suspension of trading prior to early redemption events.

## Compliance Requirements

- All trading members of BSE must stop dealing in ECAP EQUITIES LIMITED debentures (ISIN: INE468N08043 / Scrip Code: 975500) with effect from 27 February 2026.
- Members should update their systems and desks to reflect the no-dealings restriction on the specified scrip from that date.

## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Circular Date | 24 February 2026 |
| Record Date (Early Redemption) | 27 February 2026 |
| No Dealings Effective From | 27 February 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

The suspension is limited in scope, affecting only one NCD series (INE468N08043) of ECAP EQUITIES LIMITED. Existing holders of these debentures will have their securities redeemed early as per the company's terms. Secondary market liquidity in this instrument will cease from 27 February 2026. The broader market impact is minimal given the single-issuer, single-series nature of the action.
