## Impact Assessment

The listing increases the total equity share capital of Omansh Enterprises Limited by 1,25,00,000 shares, which may have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders. However, since the entire newly listed tranche is locked in until April 30, 2027, near-term secondary market supply pressure is minimal. The shares arise from an NCLT resolution process, signalling the company's ongoing restructuring. Investors and traders should factor in the lock-in period and the resolution plan background when assessing the company's equity. Overall market impact is moderate and limited to participants directly holding or tracking this scrip.
