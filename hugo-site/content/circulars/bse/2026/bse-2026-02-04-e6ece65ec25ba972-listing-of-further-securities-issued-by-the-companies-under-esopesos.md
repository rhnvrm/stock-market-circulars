- All market participants must take note of the new securities being listed
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the additional shares available for trading from February 5, 2026
- No specific compliance action required beyond awareness

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 4, 2026
- **Listing and Trading Commencement**: February 5, 2026 (Thursday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (NA for all companies)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine corporate action that increases the float of shares marginally. The quantities involved represent a small fraction of the total outstanding shares for each company.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - This is a standard listing process requiring no special operational changes. Market participants need only be aware of the additional shares in circulation.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible - While technically increasing supply, the share quantities are relatively small and the absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares could be traded immediately, though ESOP holders typically retain shares for longer periods.

**Company-Specific Notes**: ICICI Bank has the largest number of shares being listed (348,380), but this represents a tiny fraction of its massive float. Paytm (One 97 Communications) continues its ESOP issuance pattern as part of employee retention strategies.
