## Impact Assessment

The one-day postponement has limited operational impact. Trading members and investors in Modern Diagnostic & Research Centre Limited need to adjust their expectations for the segment transfer. The shift from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment will eventually allow for normal intraday trading and settlement, improving liquidity for this SME stock. The delay is purely administrative due to the unscheduled trading holiday and does not reflect any issues with the company or transfer process.
