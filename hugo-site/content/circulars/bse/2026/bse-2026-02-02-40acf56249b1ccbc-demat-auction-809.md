## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. Demat auctions are routine settlement mechanisms to handle delivery shortages. The quantities involved are relatively small compared to typical trading volumes for most listed securities.

**Operational Impact:** Affects trading members who failed to deliver securities in the specified settlement. They will need to purchase shares through the auction mechanism, potentially at premium prices.

**Investor Impact:** Negligible for retail investors. This is a backend settlement process between trading members and the exchange.
