## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects holders and traders of three specific Lodha Developers debenture series in the debt market segment.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to reflect the revised face values for these three debenture series. The part redemption reduces the principal amount outstanding on these debt instruments, which affects valuation, pricing, and settlement calculations. Debenture holders will receive partial repayment while continuing to hold the securities with reduced face values.
