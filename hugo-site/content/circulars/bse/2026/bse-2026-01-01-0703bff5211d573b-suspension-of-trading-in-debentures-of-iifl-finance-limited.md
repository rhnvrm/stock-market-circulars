Trading members are advised not to deal in these specified debentures from the suspension date.

- Notice reference: DR-794/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational notice for debenture redemption procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from January 8, 2026
- Trading members should note the suspension and inform their clients holding these debentures
- Compliance with record date requirements for redemption and interest payment processing

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 1, 2026
- **Record Date**: January 8, 2026
- **Trading Suspension Date**: January 8, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine corporate action affecting only two specific debenture series from IIFL Finance. The suspension is temporary and directly related to the scheduled redemption process.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these debentures will receive their redemption proceeds and any applicable interest as per the terms. No trading will be possible from the suspension date, but this is expected for maturing debt securities.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - Standard procedure for debenture redemption that trading members routinely handle.
