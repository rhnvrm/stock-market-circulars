- Trigger: The scrip did not hit the lower circuit on February 19, 2026 (Thursday) or February 20, 2026 (Friday)

- The action is included in the end-of-day corporate action file (*.SDE) for February 20, 2026
- Queries can be directed to bseindex@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

This exclusion follows the policy established by BSE Index Services Private Ltd vide Notice No. 20250403-46, which governs the removal of spun-off scrips from BSE Indices after a demerger/scheme of arrangement. No new regulatory changes are introduced; this is an application of the existing framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Index fund managers and ETF operators tracking any of the affected indices must rebalance portfolios to exclude Kwality Walls (India) Ltd before market open on February 24, 2026
- Custodians and clearing members should note the update in the corporate action file (*.SDE) released on February 20, 2026
- Clients with index-linked products should review exposure to the affected indices

## Important Dates

- **February 19, 2026**: Scrip did not hit lower circuit (Day 1 of trigger condition)
- **February 20, 2026**: Scrip did not hit lower circuit (Day 2 of trigger condition); circular issued
- **February 20, 2026 (EOD)**: Corporate action file (*.SDE) updated with this exclusion
- **February 24, 2026 (Prior to market open)**: Effective date of exclusion from all listed BSE indices

## Impact Assessment

The exclusion of Kwality Walls (India) Ltd from BSE SENSEX and over 30 major indices — including BSE 100, BSE 200, BSE 500, BSE FMCG, BSE India Manufacturing Index, BSE ALLCAP, BSE LARGECAP, BSE SENSEX 50, and multiple thematic/factor indices — will have a broad and immediate impact:

- **Passive funds and ETFs** tracking these indices must sell their holdings in Kwality Walls (India) Ltd before February 24, 2026 open, which may create selling pressure on the stock
- **FMCG and sectoral indices** such as BSE FAST MOVING CONSUMER GOODS will see a constituent change requiring reweighting
- **Factor and thematic indices** (Low Volatility, Quality, Equal Weight, ESG) will also require rebalancing
- The action is a direct consequence of the demerger process; the spun-off scrip's price behavior (not hitting lower circuit) triggered the scheduled removal per existing policy
- Market participants holding index-linked derivatives or structured products referencing any of the 30+ affected indices should assess their positions ahead of the February 24 effective date
