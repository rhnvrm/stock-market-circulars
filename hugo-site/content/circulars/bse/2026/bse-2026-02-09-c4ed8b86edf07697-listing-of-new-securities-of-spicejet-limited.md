No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification for new securities.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note the listing of these new securities and ensure proper settlement for trades executed from February 10, 2026 onwards.

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment**: November 18, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: February 10, 2026
- **Lock-in Period Ends**: August 9, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The issuance represents a significant dilution event for SpiceJet Limited, adding 11.25 crore shares to the existing equity base. The preferential allotment to non-promoters for loan conversion suggests debt restructuring activity. The lock-in period until August 9, 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure from these shares. Market impact is moderate as this increases the float and may affect share price dynamics once the lock-in expires.
