## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the specified debentures from February 1, 2025
- All exchange members are required to take note of this suspension

## Important Dates

- **January 22, 2026**: Record date for redemption eligibility

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of this specific debenture series. No broader market implications.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update systems to block trades in this security. Debenture holders approaching maturity should prepare for redemption proceeds.

**Investor Impact**: High for specific debenture holders who need to be aware of the trading suspension and upcoming maturity. Liquidity eliminated ahead of redemption date, which is standard practice for maturing debt securities.
