title: Additional Exposure Margin on Securities under MWPL – February 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has issued this circular to notify market participants that additional exposure margin will be levied on 18 securities that have breached the Market Wide Position Limit (MWPL) thresholds for February 2026. This measure is intended to curb excessive speculative activity in the futures and options (F&O) segment and reduce systemic risk when aggregate open interest in a security exceeds prescribed limits.

## Key Points

- Additional exposure margin is applicable to 18 securities under MWPL as of February 2026.
- The circular is issued under BSE's surveillance and risk management framework for the derivatives segment.
- Affected securities span sectors including banking, pharma, infrastructure, energy, metals, and telecom.
- Traders holding open F&O positions in these securities will be required to maintain higher margin deposits.
- The measure applies until open interest in these securities falls below MWPL thresholds.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework is introduced. This circular operationalises the existing SEBI and BSE provisions on Market Wide Position Limits, which mandate additional exposure margins when aggregate open interest across all market participants exceeds defined thresholds for individual securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members / Brokers**: Must collect additional exposure margin from clients holding open F&O positions in the 18 listed securities.
- **Clearing Members**: Must ensure sufficient margin is deposited with the clearing corporation for these securities.
- **Investors / Traders**: Must maintain adequate margin in their accounts to avoid forced square-off of positions in affected securities.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 20, 2026 (date of circular issuance).
- **Duration**: Applicable until the open interest in each security falls below the MWPL threshold; reviewed periodically by BSE.

## Impact Assessment

- **Derivatives Traders**: Margin requirements increase for open positions in these 18 securities, potentially leading to position reductions or additional fund infusion.
- **Market Liquidity**: Higher margin costs may dampen speculative activity and reduce open interest in these securities, which is the intended regulatory outcome.
- **Sectors Affected**: Banking (Bandhan Bank, RBL Bank, LIC Housing Finance, Sammaan Capital), Pharmaceuticals (Aurobindo Pharma, Glenmark), Infrastructure/Real Estate (DLF, NBCC, Container Corporation, Indus Towers), Energy (JSW Energy, NMDC), Telecom (Vodafone Idea), and others.
- **Overall Risk**: Low systemic risk; this is a standard surveillance tool. No trading ban is imposed — only incremental margin costs for F&O participants.
