title: Revision in Price Bands for Nine Securities Effective January 13, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for nine securities effective from January 13, 2026. The price bands range from 2% to 20%, representing changes from their existing levels. This surveillance measure is designed to control volatility and ensure orderly trading in these securities.

## Key Points

- Nine securities subject to revised price bands effective January 13, 2026
- Price bands vary from 2% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive)
- Bizotic Commercial Ltd has the most restrictive band at 2%
- Dachepalli Publishers Ltd and Olympic Management & Financial Services Ltd have 20% bands
- PG Foils Ltd has a 10% band
- Remaining five securities have 5% price bands
- Changes implemented as surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

BSE is modifying price band restrictions on nine securities as part of its surveillance framework. Price bands limit the maximum price movement (up or down) that a security can experience in a single trading day. Tighter bands indicate heightened surveillance and greater restrictions on price volatility.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands from January 13, 2026
- All trades in affected securities must remain within the specified price band limits
- Members requiring clarifications should contact BSE at bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Systems and algorithms must be updated to reflect new price band restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 12, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 13, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Traders and investors in these nine securities will experience varying levels of trading restrictions based on the assigned price bands. Securities with tighter bands (2%, 5%) will have limited intraday price movement, potentially affecting liquidity and trading strategies. Those with wider bands (20%) will have greater price discovery flexibility.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their risk management systems and surveillance tools to accommodate the new price bands. Algorithmic trading systems may require recalibration to function within the revised limits.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware that price movements will be constrained within the specified bands, which may affect exit or entry strategies for short-term positions.
