## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Addition of a new listed entity in the technology/systems sector with nearly 29 million shares. The staggered lock-in periods will result in gradual supply increase over 5 years, potentially moderating immediate selling pressure.

**Liquidity Impact**: Initial free float will be limited due to extensive lock-in provisions covering approximately 80% of issued shares with varying lock-in periods. Only the OFS component (1.09 million shares) and certain Fresh Issue shares become tradeable within 1-3 months.

**Investor Impact**: Long-term lock-in on significant portion (5.79 million shares locked till 2031) indicates strong promoter/pre-IPO investor commitment. Investors should be aware of supply unlock schedule when making trading decisions.
