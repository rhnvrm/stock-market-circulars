## Compliance Requirements

**Lock-in Provisions:**

Trading members must ensure compliance with the following lock-in requirements:

- 5,50,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 28012302 to 28562301): Locked until July 15, 2027
- 75,75,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 28562302 to 36137301): Locked until July 15, 2026
- 31,00,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 36137302 to 39237301): Locked until July 15, 2027
- 15,00,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 39237301 to 40737301): Locked until July 15, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date:** November 28, 2025
- **Listing/Trading Start Date:** January 5, 2026
- **First Lock-in Expiry:** July 15, 2026 (for 90,75,000 shares)
- **Second Lock-in Expiry:** July 15, 2027 (for 36,50,000 shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. This is a routine preferential allotment listing that increases the company's equity base by approximately 12.73 crore shares. The staggered lock-in periods (until July 2026 and July 2027) will prevent immediate selling pressure on the stock.

**Dilution Impact:** Existing shareholders will experience dilution as new shares are added to the capital structure. The preferential issue to Promoter and Non-Promoter categories at Rs. 13.25/- per share may indicate the company's fundraising needs.

**Trading Impact:** Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new share count and ensure lock-in restrictions are properly enforced in their trading platforms.
