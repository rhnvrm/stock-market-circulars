The suspension is necessitated by the company's decision to set the record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest on the same day.

## Key Points

- Trading Members are prohibited from dealing in the specified debentures from January 15, 2026
- The affected debenture is ABREL-7.97%-30-1-26-PVT (ISIN: INE055A08029)

- Suspension applies to debt segment trading members
- Notice issued under reference DR-799/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard operational suspension triggered by corporate action (redemption) requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must immediately cease all dealings in the specified debentures (INE055A08029) from January 15, 2026
- Members should ensure their systems are updated to prevent inadvertent trading in the suspended security
- No buy or sell orders should be accepted for this debenture series after the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** January 9, 2026
- **Record Date:** January 15, 2026 (for redemption and interest payment)
- **No Dealings From:** January 15, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - affects only a specific debenture series of one company in the debt segment.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal - routine corporate action suspension that trading members regularly handle as part of standard operations.

**Investor Impact:** Moderate for affected debenture holders who will receive redemption proceeds and final interest payment. No impact on equity investors or holders of other debt instruments of the company.

**Liquidity Impact:** Not applicable as trading is suspended precisely because the instrument is being redeemed and will cease to exist post-maturity.
