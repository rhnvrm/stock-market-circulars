## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a routine listing of preferential shares representing warrant conversion. The lock-in periods (1-year for 4.54 lakh shares and 18-months for 61.15 lakh shares) will restrict immediate supply in the market.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to update their systems to recognize the new securities and associated lock-in restrictions. The preferential allotment increases the total issued equity capital of Apollo Micro Systems Limited.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders should note dilution from 65.69 lakh new shares. However, since these rank pari-passu with existing shares, there are no differential rights or privileges.
