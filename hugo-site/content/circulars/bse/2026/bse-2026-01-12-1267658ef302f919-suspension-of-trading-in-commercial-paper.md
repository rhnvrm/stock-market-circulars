- **January 19, 2026**: Trading suspension for Bajaj Housing Finance, InCred Financial Services, and Nuvama Wealth commercial papers (DR-801/2025-2026)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with limited market impact. Investors holding these commercial papers will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms. The suspension prevents any trading activity that could interfere with the redemption process. Market liquidity in these specific instruments will be temporarily unavailable, but this is standard procedure for maturing commercial papers.
