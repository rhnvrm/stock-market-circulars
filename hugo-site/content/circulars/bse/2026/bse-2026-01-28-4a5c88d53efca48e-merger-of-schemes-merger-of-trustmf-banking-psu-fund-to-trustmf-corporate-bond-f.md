The merger has received SEBI's no objection via email dated December 26, 2025. Unitholders of both schemes are provided a 30-day exit window from January 12, 2026 to February 10, 2026 with no exit load, as this constitutes a fundamental attribute change under SEBI Mutual Funds Regulations, 1996.

## Key Points

- Board of Directors of TRUST Asset Management Private Limited and TRUST AMC Trustee Private Limited have approved the merger
- SEBI issued "No Objection" to the merger via email dated December 26, 2025
- Merging Scheme: TRUSTMF Banking & PSU Fund - open ended debt scheme investing in debt instruments of Banks, PSUs, Public Financial Institutions and Municipal Bonds
- Surviving Scheme: TRUSTMF Corporate Bond Fund - open-ended debt scheme investing in AA+ and above rated corporate bonds
- Unitholders not required to take action if they agree with the merger
- Units in Merging Scheme will be converted to units in Surviving Scheme at last available NAV or Face Value
- Original allotment date in Merging Scheme will be considered for exit load calculation in Surviving Scheme
- Pledges, liens, or encumbrances on units will be transferred to corresponding units in Surviving Scheme

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Individual communication is being sent to existing unitholders of both schemes
- 30-day written notice provided to unitholders as per regulatory requirements
- Unitholders who disagree with the merger must exit during the notice period to avoid automatic conversion
