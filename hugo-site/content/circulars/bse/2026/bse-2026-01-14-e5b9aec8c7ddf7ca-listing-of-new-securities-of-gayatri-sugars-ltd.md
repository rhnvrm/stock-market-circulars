## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing announcement with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment represents warrant conversion to non-promoters, with all shares locked in for approximately 6.5 months from trading commencement. The lock-in period prevents immediate selling pressure. The issue price at par (Rs. 10/-) and the relatively small number of shares suggest limited dilution impact on existing shareholders.
