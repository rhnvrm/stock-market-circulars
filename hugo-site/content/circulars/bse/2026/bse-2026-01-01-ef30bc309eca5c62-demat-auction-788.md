## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational notice with minimal market impact. The demat auction mechanism is a standard settlement process used when delivery obligations cannot be met through normal channels. The auction affects only specific trading members who have outstanding delivery obligations in the listed securities. The quantities involved are relatively small for most scrips, suggesting limited systemic impact. Notable larger quantities include Rajnish Wellness (65,575 shares), Rama Steel Tubes (30,000 shares), and Sattva Sukun (10,000 shares).
