Sanwaria Consumer Ltd (Security Code: 519260, ISIN: INE890C01046) is being moved to GSM Stage I, while Adline Chem Lab Limited (Security Code: 524604, ISIN: INE276T01018) is being moved to GSM Stage II. The circular notes that Sanwaria Consumer Ltd information is as per NSE.

## Key Points

- Additional margin requirements
- Increased disclosure obligations
- Potential trading frequency restrictions

## Compliance Requirements

- Ensure adequate margin collection from clients
- Inform clients about GSM status of securities

**For Investors:**
- Be aware of increased surveillance and potential trading restrictions
- Understand enhanced risk associated with GSM securities
- Consider liquidity constraints before trading

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** February 5, 2026 (circular date)
- Implementation details and specific effective dates to be confirmed through subsequent exchange communications

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Reduced liquidity expected in both securities due to surveillance measures
- Potential price volatility as market adjusts to new classification
- Investor caution likely to increase, affecting trading volumes

**Trading Impact:**
- Stage I (Sanwaria Consumer): Initial surveillance with moderate restrictions
- Stage II (Adline Chem Lab): Stricter surveillance with enhanced trading restrictions and higher margins
- Both securities may face reduced institutional participation

**Investor Impact:**
- Higher transaction costs due to additional margin requirements
- Limited trading opportunities due to potential price band restrictions
- Increased due diligence required before investment decisions

The GSM framework is designed to alert investors about securities with unusual price movements or other concerns, promoting informed decision-making while allowing continued trading under enhanced surveillance.
