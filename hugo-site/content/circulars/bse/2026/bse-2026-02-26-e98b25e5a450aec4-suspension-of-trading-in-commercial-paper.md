## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt market action with limited broader market impact. The affected instruments are short-term commercial papers approaching maturity. Investors holding these CPs will receive redemption proceeds on the respective record dates. The suspension of trading prevents last-minute transactions that could complicate the redemption process. No impact on the equity shares of the parent companies is expected. Trading desks with exposure to any of these 18 CPs in the debt segment should take note of the blackout dates.
