## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it pertains to routine operational holidays for international mutual fund schemes. The non-business days are aligned with foreign market holidays (likely Presidents' Day in the US on February 16 and Chinese New Year holidays for Greater China funds). Investors in these schemes should plan their transactions accordingly, but there is no systemic impact on the broader Indian equity or debt markets. The notice ensures transparency and helps investors manage their mutual fund portfolios effectively.
