  Sub-Division
---

## Summary

BSE has issued Notice No. 20260227-11 informing trading members that Silver Touch Technologies Limited (scrip code 543525) has been assigned a new ISIN number following the sub-division of its equity shares. This is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20260220-50 dated February 20, 2026.

## Key Points

- New ISIN assigned: **INE625X01026** for Silver Touch Technologies Limited (scrip code 543525)
- Sub-division ratio: Equity shares sub-divided from face value of **Rs. 10/-** per share to **Rs. 2/-** per share
- The new ISIN is effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of **March 6, 2026**
- Reference DR number: DR-834/2025-2026
- This notice supersedes and continues from the earlier notice dated February 20, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This circular is an operational update implementing the previously announced stock sub-division corporate action for Silver Touch Technologies Limited under existing SEBI and BSE listing regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to use the new ISIN **INE625X01026** for all trades in Silver Touch Technologies Limited equity shares effective March 6, 2026
- Members should ensure back-office and depository participant systems reflect the new ISIN from the ex-date onwards
- All transactions on or after the ex-date must reference the new ISIN; the old ISIN should not be used for fresh trades post ex-date

## Important Dates

- **February 20, 2026**: Original notice (No. 20260220-50) issued announcing the ISIN change
- **February 27, 2026**: Current notice date (No. 20260227-11) confirming new ISIN details
- **March 6, 2026**: Ex-date — new ISIN INE625X01026 becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational update following a stock sub-division corporate action. The impact is primarily on trading members and depository participants who must update their reference data and trading systems to use the new ISIN from March 6, 2026. Investors holding Silver Touch Technologies shares will see their share count increase proportionally (5x) due to the 10-to-2 face value split, while the intrinsic value remains the same. No market disruption is expected, but failure to update to the new ISIN could result in settlement or reconciliation issues for trading members.
