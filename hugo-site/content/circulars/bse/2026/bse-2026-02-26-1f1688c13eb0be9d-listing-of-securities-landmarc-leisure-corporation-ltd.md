## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** October 6, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date:** February 27, 2026
- **Lock-in expiry (13,64,00,000 shares; Dist. Nos. 800000001–936400000):** August 31, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 180 million new shares to the BSE-tradeable universe for Landmarc Leisure Corporation Ltd., representing a significant increase in total share count. However, the immediate free-float impact is limited due to lock-in restrictions covering all allotted shares until August 2026. The preferential allotment to non-promoters at Rs. 1.11/- per share may have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders. Overall market impact is expected to be low in the near term given the lock-in constraints.
