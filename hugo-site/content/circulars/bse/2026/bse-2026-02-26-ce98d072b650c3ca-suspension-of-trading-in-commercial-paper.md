## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt market operational notice with limited broader market impact. The suspension affects only the specific commercial paper instruments listed — it does not affect the equity shares of any of these companies. Holders of these commercial papers should be aware that secondary market trading will be suspended from the respective record dates and should plan positions accordingly. The redemptions are expected to proceed normally on schedule.
