## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium - Affects specific security holders only. Standard corporate actions that are routine in nature.

**Investor Impact:** Medium - Important for investors holding the affected securities to note record dates for eligibility. Missing record dates means forfeiting rights to dividends, interest payments, or rights issue participation.

**Operational Impact:** Low - Standard processing by market infrastructure. Trading flags (0 or 1) indicate whether securities will trade ex-benefit on or after record date.

**Financial Impact:** Varies by security - Interest payments and dividends provide income to holders. Redemptions return principal. Rights issues require additional investment decisions.

Investors holding 360 ONE Prime, ARKA FINCAP, Avi Polymers, BEML, Bajaj Finance, Ballarpur Industries, AVIGNA HOUSING, or BLS E-Services securities should verify their holdings and ensure they meet record date requirements for intended benefits.
