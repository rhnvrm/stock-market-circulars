## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework applies enhanced surveillance to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or trading patterns. Securities in this framework may face restrictions such as reduced price bands, additional margin requirements, or trading only in specific sessions. The framework operates in stages (I, II, III) with progressively stringent measures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of securities under ST-ASM framework
- Trading members should ensure compliance with additional margin requirements for ST-ASM securities
- Investors should note that securities marked with @ are SME scrips
- Securities marked with * follow NSE's surveillance framework
- Securities marked with ~ are T+0 scrips shortlisted based on parent company

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 14, 2026 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The surveillance measures affect trading liquidity and conditions for the listed securities. Investors in these stocks may experience reduced liquidity, higher margin requirements, and restricted trading conditions.

**Trading Impact**: Securities entering ST-ASM may see reduced trading volumes due to additional restrictions. Movement to higher stages indicates continued surveillance concerns. Securities exiting the framework will have normal trading conditions restored.

**Investor Impact**: Traders and investors holding positions in affected securities need to be aware of additional margin requirements and trading restrictions. The surveillance framework is designed to protect investors from excessive volatility and potential manipulation.
