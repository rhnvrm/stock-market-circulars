## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing enables trading of INDO SMC LIMITED shares on BSE. Approximately 19.3% of shares (44,15,000 shares) are freely tradable immediately, while the remaining shares are under various lock-in periods. This staggered release of locked-in shares over the next 3 years will gradually increase the free float.

**Liquidity Impact**: Initial liquidity will be limited to the non-locked-in IPO shares. Liquidity will improve progressively as anchor investor and promoter lock-ins expire in phases.

**Investor Impact**: Investors can now trade INDO SMC LIMITED shares on BSE, subject to lock-in restrictions for certain categories of shareholders. The long lock-in periods for promoter shares (up to 3 years) indicate regulatory commitment to stability.
