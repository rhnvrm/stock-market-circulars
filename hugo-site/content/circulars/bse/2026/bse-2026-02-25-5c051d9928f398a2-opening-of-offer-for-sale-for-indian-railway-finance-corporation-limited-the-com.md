## Summary

BSE has issued a circular announcing the opening of an Offer for Sale (OFS) for Indian Railway Finance Corporation Limited (IRFC), a public sector entity that raises financing for Indian Railways. The circular includes provisions for undersubscription acceptance, allowing the seller to accept bids even in the event the OFS is not fully subscribed.

## Key Points

- Offer for Sale (OFS) has been opened for Indian Railway Finance Corporation Limited (NSE/BSE ticker: IRFC)
- The circular covers the opening schedule and participation details for the OFS
- Undersubscription acceptance clause is included, allowing the seller (likely the Government of India/promoter) to accept partial subscription
- The OFS is conducted through the BSE exchange platform in accordance with SEBI OFS guidelines
- Separate windows may be available for non-retail and retail investors
- Brokers and trading members are required to facilitate client participation per exchange norms

## Regulatory Changes

- No new regulatory changes introduced; this circular follows the existing SEBI OFS framework (SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/18/2012 and subsequent amendments)
- The undersubscription acceptance provision is a seller's option under the prevailing OFS guidelines

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure OFS bids are placed only during the designated OFS window
- Members must comply with margin and fund requirement norms for OFS bids
- Retail investors (bidding at cut-off price or above the floor price) must be given a minimum 10% reservation as per SEBI guidelines
- Members must communicate OFS details and floor price to their clients promptly
- Any modifications or cancellations of bids must be done within prescribed timelines

## Important Dates

- OFS Opening Date: February 25, 2026 (as per circular date)
- Specific opening and closing times for non-retail and retail windows are detailed in the circular attachment
- Settlement of OFS trades will follow T+1 or T+2 timelines as specified

## Impact Assessment

- **Market Impact:** High — IRFC is a prominent public sector undertaking (PSU) stock; OFS activity typically increases trading volume and may exert short-term price pressure
- **Investor Impact:** Institutional and retail investors have an opportunity to acquire IRFC shares at or above the floor price, potentially at a discount to market price
- **Government Disinvestment:** This OFS is part of the broader government disinvestment programme; successful completion supports fiscal revenue targets
- **Undersubscription Clause:** If the OFS is undersubscribed, the seller's acceptance of bids ensures partial capital raising and avoids a complete withdrawal, reducing market uncertainty
- **Brokers/Members:** Required to update systems and communicate OFS availability to clients before the window opens
