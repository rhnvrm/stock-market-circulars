## Impact Assessment

This listing represents a significant corporate restructuring under insolvency proceedings. The 100:1 capital reduction severely dilutes existing public shareholders while transferring majority control (95%) to the Successful Resolution Applicants. The XT Group classification and Trade-to-Trade segment placement indicate heightened surveillance due to the company's insolvency background. The lock-in period of approximately one year for 95% of shares will limit liquidity. Existing shareholders face substantial value erosion through the capital reduction process. The company's operational viability will depend on the resolution applicant's revival plan execution.
