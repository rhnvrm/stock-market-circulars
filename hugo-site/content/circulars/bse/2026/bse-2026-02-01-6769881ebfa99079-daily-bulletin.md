Investors holding these securities must ensure their holdings are credited to their demat accounts before the respective record dates to be eligible for dividends or other benefits. The trading flags indicate whether securities will continue normal trading or face temporary suspension during book closure periods, which may affect short-term liquidity. The bulletin is particularly relevant for dividend-seeking investors and those tracking corporate action calendars.
