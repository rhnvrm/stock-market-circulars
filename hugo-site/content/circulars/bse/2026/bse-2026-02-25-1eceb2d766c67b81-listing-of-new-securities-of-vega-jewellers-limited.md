## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 5,00,000 equity shares to the tradable universe for Vega Jewellers Limited, representing a modest increase in share capital. However, since all newly listed shares carry a lock-in until October 1, 2027, there is no immediate increase in free-float or liquidity. The preferential allotment to promoters at Rs. 197.42 per share may signal promoter confidence in the company. Overall market impact is minimal and limited to existing shareholders and traders of this scrip.
