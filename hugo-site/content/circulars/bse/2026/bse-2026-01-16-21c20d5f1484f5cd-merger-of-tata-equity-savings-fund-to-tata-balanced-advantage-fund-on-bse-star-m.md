- Units will be allotted in Surviving Scheme based on closing NAV of record date
- All plan options (Direct/Regular, Growth/IDCW Payout/IDCW Reinvestment) will be mapped to corresponding options
- Systematic investment facilities (SIP/STP/SWP) will continue in Surviving Scheme without fresh registration
- Effective date of merger: February 21, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

This merger is conducted in accordance with Regulation 18(15A) of the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, which mandates a 30-day exit option at prevailing NAV without exit load for unitholders of both merging and surviving schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Written communication to be sent to unitholders of both schemes with merger details, basis of unit allocation, tax implications, and financial information
- Unitholders must submit redemption/switch requests by February 20, 2026 (up to 3:00 PM) if they wish to exit
- Fresh account statements will be issued to unitholders post-merger
- Fund house must provide exit option without exit load during the specified period
- No entry load will be charged for units allotted in the Surviving Scheme

## Important Dates

- **January 19, 2026**: Sale of units (including switch-in and SIP registrations) in Tata Equity Savings Fund suspended
- **January 22, 2026**: Exit option period begins
- **February 20, 2026**: 
  - Record date for merger
  - Last date to exercise exit option (up to 3:00 PM)
- **February 21, 2026**: Effective date of merger; Tata Equity Savings Fund ceases to exist

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a fund consolidation exercise with no direct impact on equity or debt markets.

**Investor Impact**: Medium - Existing unitholders of Tata Equity Savings Fund will be transitioned to Tata Balanced Advantage Fund unless they opt for exit. The 30-day exit window provides adequate time for investors to evaluate and decide. Investors who remain will see their holdings automatically transferred to a dynamic asset allocation fund with potentially different risk-return characteristics.

**Operational Impact**: Unitholders who do not exit will automatically become unitholders of Tata Balanced Advantage Fund. Existing SIP/STP/SWP registrations will continue seamlessly in the Surviving Scheme without requiring fresh registration, minimizing operational disruption for investors who choose to stay invested.
