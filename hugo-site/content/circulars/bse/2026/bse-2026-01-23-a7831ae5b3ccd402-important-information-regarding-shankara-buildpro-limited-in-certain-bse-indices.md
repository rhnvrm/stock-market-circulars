  2026
---

## Summary

This action follows the company's failure to hit the lower circuit on January 22 and 23, 2026, as part of the process for removal of spun-off scrips from BSE Indices following a scheme of arrangement for demerger.

## Key Points

- Shankara Buildpro Limited (Scrip code: 544517) will be excluded from 10 BSE indices
- Exclusion triggered because the stock did not hit lower circuit on January 22 and 23, 2026
- Action follows previously announced process (Notice No: 20250403-46) for removal of spun-off scrips post-demerger
- The corporate action has been included in the end-of-day corporate action file (*.SDE)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This action implements the previously announced process (Notice No: 20250403-46) for handling spun-off scrips in index constituents following demerger schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Index fund managers and passive investors tracking affected indices must rebalance portfolios to exclude Shankara Buildpro Limited
- Market participants should note the stock's removal from index calculations
- Queries should be directed to bseindex@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **January 22, 2026**: First observation day - stock did not hit lower circuit
- **January 23, 2026**: Second observation day - stock did not hit lower circuit
- **January 28, 2026**: Effective exclusion date (prior to market open)

## Affected Indices

Shankara Buildpro Limited will be excluded from the following BSE indices:

1. BSE SMALLCAP
2. BSE ALLCAP
3. BSE CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY
4. BSE 1000
5. BSE NEXT 500
6. BSE NEXT 250
7. MICROCAP BSE 1000
8. MULTICAP EQUAL SIZE WEIGHTED (25%)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Moderate impact on index fund managers and passive investors who track the affected indices. The exclusion will require portfolio rebalancing and may cause selling pressure on January 28, 2026.

**Operational Impact**: Index providers and fund managers need to execute rebalancing trades before or on the effective date. The stock's removal from 9 different indices may affect liquidity and trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: Passive investors in funds tracking these indices will see automatic divestment of Shankara Buildpro Limited holdings. Active investors should note potential price volatility around the exclusion date.
