- **February 06, 2026 (T+1 Day)**: OFS bidding for retail investors and non-retail investors who chose to carry forward un-allotted bids

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The potential sale of up to 7.36% of IndiGrid InvIT's Unit capital by a major public unitholder (Government of Singapore) represents a significant supply in the market. This could impact Unit pricing and create trading opportunities for both retail and institutional investors.

**Liquidity Impact**: The OFS will provide substantial liquidity in IndiGrid Units over the two-day bidding period, with separate windows for retail and non-retail investors ensuring market participation across investor categories.

**Investor Implications**: Retail investors get dedicated access on T+1 Day. Non-retail investors have priority access on T Day with option to carry forward un-allotted bids to T+1 Day. The oversubscription option provides flexibility to increase offer size based on demand.

**Operational Impact**: Separate designated trading windows on both BSE and NSE will be operational for the OFS, requiring brokers and trading members to facilitate client participation through the OFS mechanism.
