## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it pertains to operational facility activation for a specific mutual fund house (SAMCO) on the BSE StAR MF platform. The auto switch facility provides convenience to investors in the SAMCO Mid Cap Fund NFO by allowing automated switching to overnight or arbitrage fund variants. Impact is limited to SAMCO mutual fund investors and does not affect broader market operations or trading activities.
