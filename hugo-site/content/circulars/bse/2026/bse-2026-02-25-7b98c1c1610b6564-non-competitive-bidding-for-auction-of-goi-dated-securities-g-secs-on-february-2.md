## Impact Assessment

This is a standard periodic G-sec auction notification affecting debt market participants — trading members and direct investors — who wish to participate in the non-competitive bidding process. The issue size of Rs. 32,000 crore for the 6.48% GS 2035 re-issuance is significant in the government securities market. The tight bidding window for members (closing at 8:00 am on auction day) requires timely action. No broader market disruption is anticipated; this is routine government borrowing activity.
