- Issued to non-promoters on a preferential basis via conversion of warrants

- Date of allotment: January 24, 2026
- ISIN: INE807M01031
- All 60,00,000 shares are subject to lock-in until October 20, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification under BSE's framework for new securities admitted to trading.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to update their systems to permit trading in these new securities from March 2, 2026
- Lock-in restrictions on all 60,00,000 shares must be observed until October 20, 2026; these shares cannot be traded until the lock-in period expires

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** January 24, 2026
- **Listing / Trading Commencement Date:** March 2, 2026 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Expiry Date:** October 20, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing of 60 lakh new equity shares will result in dilution of existing shareholders' stake in Titan Intech Limited. However, since all newly listed shares are under lock-in until October 20, 2026, there will be no immediate additional supply in the open market. The preferential allotment to non-promoters via warrant conversion signals capital raising activity by the company. Market impact is expected to be limited and company-specific.
