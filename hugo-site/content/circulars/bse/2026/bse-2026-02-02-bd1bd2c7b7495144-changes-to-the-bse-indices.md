## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational index rebalancing due to a corporate action (demerger).

## Compliance Requirements

- Index fund managers and ETF providers tracking affected BSE indices must adjust their portfolios to reflect the new index compositions
- Market participants should note the changes in index constituents for trading and investment strategies
- Clients with queries should contact bseindex@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **February 02, 2026**: Circular notice date
- **February 06, 2026**: Effective date for all index changes and demerger

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium impact on index-tracking funds and ETFs that replicate the affected BSE indices. Fund managers will need to rebalance portfolios by selling Genus Power shares and purchasing ASM Technologies and Prime Focus shares.

**Operational Impact**: The removal of Genus Power from 9 different BSE indices and the addition of replacement stocks will require coordinated trading activity. Index funds with significant assets under management may experience tracking errors during the transition period.

**Investor Impact**: Passive investors in index funds tracking BSE 1000, BSE NEXT 500, BSE SMALLCAP, and other affected indices will see automatic portfolio adjustments. Active investors should be aware of potential price movements in all three stocks (Genus Power, ASM Technologies, Prime Focus) around the effective date due to index rebalancing flows.
