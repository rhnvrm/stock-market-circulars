These shares will be available for trading from January 28, 2026. The shares were allotted in two tranches during August and October 2024 at par value of Rs. 10/- each and are subject to lock-in periods ranging from August 2026 to July 2026.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following preferential allotment procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the new securities listed under scrip code 532183
- Lock-in provisions must be enforced by trading systems

  - 1,33,332 shares: August 15, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The listing involves a limited number of shares (13.27 lakh) of a single company with full lock-in restrictions, preventing immediate trading of these shares. The lock-in periods extending into mid-2026 ensure controlled market entry.

**Shareholder Dilution**: The preferential issue to non-promoters will increase the public shareholding and floating stock of Gayatri Sugars Limited.

**Liquidity**: No immediate liquidity impact as all shares are locked in until July-August 2026. Post lock-in expiry, gradual increase in tradable shares may improve liquidity for the counter.
