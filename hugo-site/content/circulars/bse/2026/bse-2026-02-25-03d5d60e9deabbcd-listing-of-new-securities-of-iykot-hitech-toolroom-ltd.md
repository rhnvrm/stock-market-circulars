## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine listing of a relatively small tranche of new equity shares (1,94,323 shares) resulting from rights issue conversion. The shares are pari-passu with existing equity, so no dilution of rights for existing shareholders beyond what was already anticipated at the time of the rights issue. Relevant primarily to existing shareholders who held partly paid shares and have now converted them to fully paid-up status.
