The new ISIN INE911Z01025 will be effective for trades executed on and from January 8, 2026, replacing the previous ISIN for shares that have been sub-divided from face value of Rs.10/- to Re.1/-.

## Key Points

- Company: A-1 LTD (Scrip Code: 542012)
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Re.1/-
- Ex-Date: January 8, 2026
- Reference: Continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251229-6 dated December 29, 2025
- Document Reference: DR-794/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action notification following share sub-division procedures already established under existing regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN number INE911Z01025 for all trades in A-1 LTD executed on or after January 8, 2026
- System updates required to reflect the new ISIN and face value change from Rs.10/- to Re.1/-

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 7, 2026
- **Ex-Date**: January 8, 2026 (new ISIN becomes effective for trading)
- **Previous Notice**: December 29, 2025 (Exchange Notice No. 20251229-6)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to A-1 LTD shareholders and traders. The share sub-division increases liquidity by reducing per-share price, making shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN and adjusted share face value. All trades from January 8, 2026 onwards must reference INE911Z01025.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their holdings multiplied by 10 (from Rs.10/- face value to Re.1/- face value), with proportionate adjustment in share price. Total investment value remains unchanged.
