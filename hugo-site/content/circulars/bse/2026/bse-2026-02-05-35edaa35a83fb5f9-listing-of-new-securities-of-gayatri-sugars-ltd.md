## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. The listing involves a relatively small number of shares (1.67 lakh) representing warrant conversion from an existing allotment made in November 2024. All shares are subject to lock-in until August 30, 2026, preventing immediate trading. The preferential allotment to non-promoters does not affect promoter holdings. This is a routine corporate action with no immediate trading implications due to lock-in restrictions.
