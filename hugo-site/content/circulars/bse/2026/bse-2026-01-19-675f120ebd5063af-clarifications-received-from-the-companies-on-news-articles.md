## Summary

BSE issued rumor verification letters to Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited and Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited regarding news articles. Sun Pharma clarified that news about a USD 10 billion Organon acquisition is speculative with no material event requiring disclosure under Regulation 30. Nagarjuna Fertilizers clarified that following the sale of its assets in July 2024, the company's financials are drawn as not a going concern and it is not aware of the current owners' plans or activities.

## Key Points

- Sun Pharma stated the information is speculative in nature with no material event requiring disclosure under Regulation 30 of Listing Regulations
- Sun Pharma confirmed adherence to highest standards of governance and will inform stock exchanges of any material events as required

- Post asset sale, Nagarjuna Fertilizers' financials have been drawn as not a going concern
- Nagarjuna Fertilizers stated it is not aware of the plans or activities of current asset owners
- Both companies responded to BSE Surveillance queries with clarifications

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must respond to BSE rumor verification letters regarding news articles that may impact trading
- Companies must clarify whether speculative news requires disclosure under Regulation 30
- Companies must maintain transparency regarding material events and keep stock exchanges informed

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. Both clarifications deny or provide context to speculative news, reducing potential market speculation. Sun Pharma's denial of acquisition talks should stabilize any trading volatility. Nagarjuna Fertilizers' clarification reinforces its non-going concern status already disclosed in July 2024.

**Company Impact:** Sun Pharma maintains its position that no material acquisition negotiations are underway. Nagarjuna Fertilizers reinforces its post-asset-sale status with no operational involvement in sold assets.

**Investor Impact:** Provides clarity to investors by addressing market rumors and speculative news reports, preventing misinformation-driven trading decisions.
