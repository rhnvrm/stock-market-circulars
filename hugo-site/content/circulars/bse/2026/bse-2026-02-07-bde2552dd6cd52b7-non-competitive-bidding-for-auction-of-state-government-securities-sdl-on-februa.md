## Impact Assessment

This circular has moderate operational impact on debt market participants, particularly those trading in state government securities. The auction provides liquidity opportunities across multiple state securities with varying maturities (2030-2056). The Rs. 52,115 crores total issue size represents significant borrowing by state governments. Trading members and direct investors participating in SDL markets need to prepare bidding strategies and ensure system access to the NCB-GSec module within the specified timelines. No impact on equity markets or listed companies.
