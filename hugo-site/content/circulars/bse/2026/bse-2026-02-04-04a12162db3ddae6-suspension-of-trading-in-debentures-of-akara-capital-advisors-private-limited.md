---

## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of AKARA CAPITAL ADVISORS PRIVATE LIMITED (ISIN: INE08XP07258, Code: 975943) effective February 6, 2026. The suspension is implemented because the company has set February 7, 2026 as the record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures.

## Key Points

- ISIN: INE08XP07258
- BSE Code: 975943
- Debenture: ACAPL-10.01%-22-2-26-PVT (10.01% coupon rate)
- Record date: February 7, 2026
- No dealings from: February 6, 2026
- Purpose: Redemption of Debentures and Payment of Interest
- Circular Reference: DR-815/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard trading suspension procedure implemented when a company sets a record date for debenture redemption and interest payment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures (ISIN: INE08XP07258) from February 6, 2026
- Trading members must inform their clients holding or interested in these debentures about the trading suspension
- Debenture holders as of record date (February 7, 2026) will be eligible for interest payment and redemption proceeds

## Important Dates

- **February 4, 2026**: Circular issued
- **February 6, 2026**: Trading suspension begins (no dealings from this date)
- **February 7, 2026**: Record date for redemption and interest payment

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Complete trading suspension eliminates secondary market liquidity for these debentures. Investors cannot exit positions before redemption.

**Investor Impact**: High for current holders - Final interest payment and principal redemption upcoming. Debenture holders as of record date will receive redemption proceeds. This appears to be the maturity of the instrument based on the naming convention (22-2-26 suggesting maturity in 2026).

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trades in this security and communicate the suspension to affected clients.
