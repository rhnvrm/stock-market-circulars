**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems with the new scrip details (code 544672, symbol TWCGOLDETF) to enable trading from January 2, 2026. The dematerialized-only trading requirement is standard for mutual fund units.

**Investor Impact**: Provides investors with an additional avenue to gain exposure to domestic gold prices through an exchange-traded fund structure with liquidity support from designated market makers.
