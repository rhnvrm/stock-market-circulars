## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of six securities into their respective Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages effective January 14, 2026. The securities are being moved to stages ranging from Stage I to Stage IV, indicating varying levels of surveillance requirements based on market behavior and compliance parameters.

## Key Points

- Six securities are being moved to different GSM stages
- Iykot Hitech Toolroom Ltd. (522245) moving to GSM Stage I
- Photon Capital Advisors Ltd. (509084) moving to GSM Stage II

- Avasara Finance Limited (511730) and Popees Cares Limited (530565) moving to GSM Stage IV
- Securities marked with special symbols (#, $) may move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in ESM or IBC frameworks

## Regulatory Changes

- Additional surveillance deposit requirements
- Trade-to-trade settlement
- Price bands
- Enhanced disclosure obligations

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors trading in these securities must be aware of the applicable GSM stage restrictions
- Trading members should monitor and comply with stage-specific trading conditions
- Companies must meet enhanced disclosure and compliance standards applicable to their GSM stage
- Brokers need to update their systems to reflect the new GSM classifications

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 14, 2026
- Circular issued: January 14, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The movement to higher GSM stages may result in reduced liquidity and trading volumes for affected securities due to stricter trading conditions. Stage IV securities face the most stringent restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will experience modified trading conditions including potential additional margin requirements, reduced leverage, and enhanced monitoring.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants need to update their risk management systems and client communications to reflect the new surveillance classifications.
