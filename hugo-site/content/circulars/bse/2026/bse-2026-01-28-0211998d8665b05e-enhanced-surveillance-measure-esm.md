The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) is a graded surveillance mechanism where:

- Stage I represents initial surveillance level
- Stage II represents heightened surveillance with stricter monitoring
- Securities can move between stages or exit based on compliance and market behavior

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the ESM classification for affected securities
- Trading in ESM securities may be subject to additional restrictions including:
  - Price bands
  - Trade-for-trade settlement
  - Higher margin requirements
  - Reduced position limits
- Investors should exercise increased caution when trading ESM securities
- Brokers must ensure clients are aware of ESM status before execution

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** January 29, 2026
- **Circular Date:** January 28, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - Enhanced surveillance directly affects liquidity and trading activity in the listed securities. Investors may face:
- Reduced liquidity due to trade-for-trade settlement requirements
- Higher transaction costs from increased margin requirements
- Greater price volatility during surveillance period

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders and traders in these securities will experience restricted trading conditions. The ESM framework serves as a warning mechanism for retail investors to exercise caution.

**Regulatory Significance:** This update demonstrates BSE's ongoing surveillance activities to maintain market integrity and protect investor interests by identifying securities with concerning trading patterns.
