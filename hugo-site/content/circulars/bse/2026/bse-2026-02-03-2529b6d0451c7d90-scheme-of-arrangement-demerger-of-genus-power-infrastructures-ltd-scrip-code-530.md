The record date is set for 06/02/2026 to determine shareholder entitlement. Shareholders will receive 1 equity share of Rs. 2/- face value in Genus Prime Infra Limited for every 6 equity shares of Re. 1/- face value held in Genus Power Infrastructures Limited. The stock will be transferred from 'A' group to 'T' group and will undergo Special Pre-open Session (SPOS) trading from 06/02/2026.

## Key Points

- NCLT Allahabad Bench has approved the Scheme of Arrangement (Demerger)
- Demerger involves separation of Investment Business Division from Genus Power Infrastructures Ltd (Demerged Company) into Genus Prime Infra Limited (Resulting Company)
- Share allotment ratio: 1 equity share of Genus Prime Infra Limited (FV Rs. 2/-) for every 6 equity shares of Genus Power Infrastructures Limited (FV Re. 1/-)
- Record date: 06/02/2026
- Ex-entitlement date: 06/02/2026 (Settlement No. DR-815/2025-2026)
- Stock transfer from 'A' group to 'T' group effective 06/02/2026
- Special Pre-open Session (SPOS) call auction applicable on 06/02/2026

This restricts normal trading and subjects the scrip to special surveillance measures.

Pursuant to SEBI Circular No. CIR/MRD/DP/01/2012 dated January 20, 2012, the stock will be part of Call Auction in Pre-open Session (Special Pre-open Session - SPOS) on 6th February, 2026.

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: 06/02/2026 - For determination of shareholders entitled to receive shares in demerger
- **Ex-Entitlement Date**: 06/02/2026 (Settlement No. DR-815/2025-2026)
- **T Group Transfer Date**: 06/02/2026 - Stock moves from 'A' group to 'T' group
- **SPOS Implementation**: 06/02/2026 - Special Pre-open Session call auction begins
- **Notice Date**: 03/02/2026

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: All shareholders holding Genus Power Infrastructures Ltd shares as of 06/02/2026 will receive additional shares in Genus Prime Infra Limited at 1:6 ratio. This represents a significant corporate action that will result in shareholding in two separate entities.

**Trading Impact**: Transfer to 'T' group significantly restricts trading activity and liquidity. The stock will be subject to trade-for-trade settlement with no intraday trading allowed. Price discovery will occur through call auction mechanism in Special Pre-open Session, which may result in higher volatility and wider bid-ask spreads.

**Market Impact**: The demerger separates the Investment Business Division into a distinct listed entity, allowing separate valuation and focused business operations. The T group classification indicates regulatory surveillance, which may temporarily impact investor sentiment and trading volumes.

**Operational Impact**: The resulting company, Genus Prime Infra Limited, will be independently listed and shareholders will hold proportionate stakes in both entities post-demerger, potentially affecting portfolio management and rebalancing strategies.
