## Regulatory Changes

Price bands serve as circuit filters to limit excessive volatility in securities trading. The revision of these bands indicates BSE's surveillance measures to control price movements based on each security's trading characteristics and market conditions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands in their trading systems before market opening on January 9, 2026
- All orders and trades must comply with new price band limits
- Clarifications can be sought by writing to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

The revised price bands will affect intraday trading ranges for these 9 securities. Tighter bands (2%) on Earkart Ltd and Jeevan Scientific Technology Ltd suggest heightened surveillance due to potential volatility concerns. The 20% band on DCM Shriram Industries indicates a more liquid security with lower volatility risk. Traders and investors in these securities should adjust their trading strategies accordingly.
