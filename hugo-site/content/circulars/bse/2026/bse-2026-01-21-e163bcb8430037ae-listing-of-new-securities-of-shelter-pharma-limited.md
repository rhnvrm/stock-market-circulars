## Impact Assessment

This listing represents a capital raise through preferential allotment with approximately 31.66% of the new shares (4,66,200 shares) subject to extended lock-in until August 2027, while the remaining shares have lock-in periods expiring in August 2026. The staggered lock-in structure indicates a mix of investor categories. The listing increases the freely tradable shares of Shelter Pharma Limited, though immediate liquidity impact is limited due to lock-in restrictions. Market impact is expected to be minimal as this is a routine corporate action affecting a single company with modest issuance size.
