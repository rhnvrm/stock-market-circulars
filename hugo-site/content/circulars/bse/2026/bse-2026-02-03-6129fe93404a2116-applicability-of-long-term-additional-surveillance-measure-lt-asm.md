## Summary

BSE has issued an update to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective February 04, 2026. The circular adds 3 new securities to the LT-ASM framework, moves 1 security to a higher surveillance stage, and removes 1 security from the framework. The consolidated list includes multiple securities across different ASM stages (I, II, and IV) that will continue to be monitored under enhanced surveillance measures.

## Key Points

- 3 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Humming Bird Education Ltd, Pratiksha Chemicals Ltd, and Shantanu Sheorey Aquakult Ltd
- Sancode Technologies Ltd moved to ASM Stage II (higher surveillance)
- Acceleratebs India Ltd moved out of LT-ASM Framework
- Changes effective from February 04, 2026
- No securities moved to lower ASM stages
- No securities shortlisted for direct Stage IV placement
- Consolidated list includes securities in ASM Stages I, II, and IV

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements periodic review and adjustment of securities under the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework. Securities can be:
- Added to the framework based on surveillance criteria
- Moved to higher stages (indicating increased surveillance concerns)
- Moved to lower stages (indicating improved compliance)
- Removed from framework due to inclusion in other frameworks (Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, IBC)

## Compliance Requirements

For securities under LT-ASM framework:
- Enhanced disclosure and monitoring requirements apply
- Trading restrictions may apply based on ASM stage
- Market participants must comply with stage-specific trading conditions
- Brokers and traders should note the ASM stage classifications for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 04, 2026 - All changes to LT-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The surveillance measures affect liquidity and trading activity in the specified securities. Securities in higher ASM stages face stricter trading conditions including potential price bands, additional margin requirements, and reduced trading frequency.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading in affected securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance conditions. Movement to higher stages may indicate increased regulatory concerns about price volatility, volumes, or corporate governance issues.

**Operational Impact**: Exchanges and brokers need to update their systems to reflect the new ASM classifications and ensure appropriate trading restrictions are implemented from the effective date.
