## Impact Assessment

Minimal broad market impact. The listing of 3,50,000 new shares (a small preferential allotment) will marginally increase the total share count of Kilburn Engineering Ltd. The majority of newly listed shares (2,00,000 out of 3,50,000) are locked in until August 2027, limiting immediate float impact. Investors holding or trading KILBURN (522101) should note the lock-in schedule to assess freely tradeable share supply.
