## Impact Assessment

This circular has a **medium** market impact. The tightening of price bands to 2% for scrips such as Kalpa Commercial Ltd, Looks Health Services Ltd, Pro Clb Global Ltd, and Transchem Ltd signals heightened surveillance concern, likely due to abnormal price or volume movements. Traders holding or watching these scrips will face significantly constrained intraday movement limits.

The widening of IRCTC's band to 20% reflects its large-cap, high-liquidity status and allows the stock greater price discovery flexibility. SpiceJet's band revision to 10% is notable given the airline's history of volatility.

Overall, this is a routine but important surveillance action that directly affects intraday and short-term trading strategies for positions in all 14 listed scrips.
