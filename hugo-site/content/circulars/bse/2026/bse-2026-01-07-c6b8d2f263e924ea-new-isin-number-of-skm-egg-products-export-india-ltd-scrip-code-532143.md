## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares while reducing the face value, potentially improving liquidity and making shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and depositories must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN number. Shareholders will see their holdings adjusted to reflect the 1:2 sub-division ratio (each Rs.10/- share becoming two Rs.5/- shares). The change is administrative in nature and does not affect the economic value of existing holdings.
