title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has issued an update to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective January 22, 2026. Three securities have been newly shortlisted for inclusion in the LT-ASM framework, while two securities are being removed due to their inclusion in other surveillance frameworks (GSM and ESM). The consolidated list now includes 17+ securities under various ASM stages.

## Key Points

- 3 securities newly added to Long Term ASM Framework: 3C IT Solutions and Telecoms (India) Ltd, Olympic Cards Ltd, and Pearl Green Clubs and Resorts Ltd
- 2 securities removed from LT-ASM: Auto Pins (India) Ltd (moved to GSM Framework) and United Van Der Horst Ltd (moved to ESM Framework)
- No securities moved to higher or lower ASM stages within the framework
- No securities shortlisted for direct Stage IV placement
- Changes effective from January 22, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework continues to monitor securities based on predefined surveillance criteria. Securities can be removed from LT-ASM when they are included in other frameworks such as Trade for Trade, GSM (Graded Surveillance Measure), ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure), or IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) Framework.

## Compliance Requirements

Market participants must note that securities under LT-ASM framework are subject to enhanced surveillance measures and additional trading restrictions. Investors and traders should exercise caution when dealing in these securities and comply with applicable trading rules specific to ASM securities.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 22, 2026 - New securities enter LT-ASM framework and specified securities exit the framework

## Impact Assessment

The addition of three securities to LT-ASM indicates heightened surveillance concerns for these scrips, potentially impacting liquidity and trading activity. The removal of two securities to GSM and ESM frameworks suggests these scrips now fall under different regulatory oversight mechanisms. Market participants trading in the affected securities should be aware of the changed surveillance status and associated restrictions. The consolidated list shows securities across different ASM stages (Stage I, II, and IV), indicating varying levels of surveillance intensity.
