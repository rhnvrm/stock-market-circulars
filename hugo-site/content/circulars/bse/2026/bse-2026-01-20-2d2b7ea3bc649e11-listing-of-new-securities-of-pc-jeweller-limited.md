## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of ~78 million new equity shares represents significant equity dilution for PC Jeweller Limited. The preferential issue to non-promoters will alter the shareholding pattern and increase the company's equity base.

**Liquidity Impact**: While the shares commence trading on January 21, 2026, the entire allotment remains locked until July 22, 2026, limiting immediate liquidity impact. Post lock-in expiry, substantial additional float will enter the market.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect. The issue price of Rs. 5.62 per share provides a reference point for valuation. The warrant conversion indicates non-promoter investor confidence in the company's prospects.
