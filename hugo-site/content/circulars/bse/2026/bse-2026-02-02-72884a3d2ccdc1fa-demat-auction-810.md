## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The auction affects 98 securities, indicating settlement failures across multiple scrips. While this is a routine process, the large quantities in some securities (like Rajnish Wellness with 500,000 shares and South Indian Bank with 253,000 shares) could lead to price volatility during auction execution.

**Operational Impact**: Affects brokers and clearing members who have outstanding delivery obligations in these securities. They will need to either deliver the shares or purchase them through the auction mechanism, potentially at higher prices.

**Investor Impact**: Investors waiting for delivery of these securities will receive them post-auction. Those holding these securities may see temporary price movements during the auction process.
