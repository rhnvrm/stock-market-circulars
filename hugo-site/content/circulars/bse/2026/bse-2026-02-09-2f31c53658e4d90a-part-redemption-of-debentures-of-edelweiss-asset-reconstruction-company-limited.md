## Impact Assessment

This corporate action has minimal market-wide impact as it affects only two specific series of privately placed debentures issued by Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company Limited. The part redemption will result in a reduced face value of Rs. 1000 per debenture for both series. Only holders of these specific debentures (ISIN: INE015L07576 and INE015L07683) will be impacted. Trading members dealing with these instruments need to ensure proper system updates to reflect the reduced face value from the effective date. There are no broader implications for debt market operations or regulatory frameworks.
