## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium impact on SLB market participants as 19 securities will have restricted lending/borrowing activities during specified periods. The staggered shut periods help distribute the impact across early-to-mid February 2026.

**Operational Impact**: Participants engaged in securities lending and borrowing need to plan their strategies around these shut periods. Existing positions may need to be squared off or adjusted before shut periods begin. The presence of major blue-chip stocks (ITC, Nestle, CONCOR) increases the operational significance for institutional participants.

**Trading Impact**: While regular trading continues, SLB participants cannot establish new lending/borrowing positions during shut periods, potentially affecting liquidity in the lending market for these securities.
