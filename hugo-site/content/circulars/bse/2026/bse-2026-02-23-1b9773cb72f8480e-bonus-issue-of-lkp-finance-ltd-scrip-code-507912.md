- Applicable SEBI circulars and operational guidelines on bonus share timelines

## Compliance Requirements

- The company must coordinate with depositories and the Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA) to meet prescribed timelines
- Bonus shares must be made available for trading at BOD on March 10, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Existing shareholders of LKP Finance Limited as of the Record Date (March 6, 2026) will receive 4 additional equity shares for every 1 share held, significantly increasing the total share count and potentially reducing the share price proportionally. The bonus issue does not alter the overall market capitalisation of the company. Shareholders should ensure their demat accounts are updated and active ahead of the record date. The defined T+1 credit and T+2 trading schedule provides clarity on liquidity timelines for bonus shares.
