- ISIN: INE847D01010

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following SEBI guidelines for preferential allotment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the new securities for trading from January 22, 2026
- Lock-in restrictions must be enforced on all 75,150 shares until August 14, 2027
- Shares cannot be transferred or traded by promoters during the lock-in period

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: November 14, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: January 22, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry**: August 14, 2027 (approximately 32-month lock-in from allotment)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The preferential allotment represents a small capital raise for Shree Pacetronix Ltd, with shares issued only to promoters at Rs. 81/- per share. The 32-month lock-in period ensures no immediate selling pressure on the stock. This is a routine corporate action with negligible impact on trading volumes or market liquidity. Investors should note the increased share capital, though the dilution effect is likely marginal depending on the company's existing equity base.
