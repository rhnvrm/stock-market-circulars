## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of this specific debenture series (ISIN: INE975F07ID8). This is a routine trading suspension mechanism to facilitate the corporate action of redemption and interest payment. The suspension ensures proper determination of eligible debenture holders as of the record date. Market-wide impact is minimal as this affects only one security issued by Kotak Mahindra Investments Limited. Investors holding these debentures will receive their redemption proceeds and accrued interest as per the terms of issuance.
