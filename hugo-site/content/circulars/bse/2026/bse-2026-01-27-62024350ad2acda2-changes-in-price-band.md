title: Price Band Revisions for Nine Securities Effective January 28, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has announced revisions to price bands for nine securities effective from January 28, 2026. The changes include both increases and decreases in trading bands, with IIFL Finance Ltd seeing an expansion to 20% while several scrips face tighter restrictions ranging from 2% to 10%. The revised bands reflect surveillance measures and will impact intraday price movement limits for these securities.

## Key Points

- Nine securities will have revised price bands effective January 28, 2026
- IIFL Finance Ltd (532636) price band expanded to 20%
- Six securities (Atvo Enterprises, Balu Forge Industries, Garnet International, Lotus Chocolate Company, Onesource Specialty Pharma, and Thrive Future Habitats) have 10% bands
- MPDL Ltd (532723) and Luxury Time Ltd (544635) restricted to 5% bands
- Thrive Future Habitats Ltd (523120) has the tightest band at 2%
- Changes implemented as surveillance measure by BSE
- Trading members notified through Notice No 20260127-35

## Regulatory Changes

Price band modifications represent surveillance actions under BSE's market monitoring framework. The varying band percentages (2%, 5%, 10%, 20%) indicate different levels of trading restrictions based on BSE's assessment of each security's risk profile and market behavior.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands from January 28, 2026
- All trades in affected securities must comply with new price movement limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect new price band parameters before market opening on the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 27, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 28, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The price band revisions will directly affect intraday volatility and trading patterns for the nine securities. Tighter bands (2-5%) on stocks like Thrive Future Habitats, MPDL, and Luxury Time will limit price swings and potentially reduce liquidity, while the 20% band on IIFL Finance allows greater price discovery.

**Trading Impact**: Day traders and algorithmic trading strategies will need to adjust to the new price movement limits. Securities with narrow bands (2-5%) may experience circuit breaker hits more frequently, potentially disrupting trading continuity.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors holding these securities should be aware that limit orders may require adjustment to account for restricted price ranges, particularly for the four securities with bands of 5% or lower.
