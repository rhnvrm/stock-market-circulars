- Companies must disclose any price-sensitive information under Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015
- Companies must inform stock exchanges of events affecting operations, performance, and price behavior

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine surveillance activity where BSE monitors unusual trading patterns and seeks clarifications from companies. All three companies confirmed no undisclosed material information exists, indicating the price and volume movements are driven by normal market dynamics rather than fundamental company developments. The clarifications provide transparency to market participants but do not reveal any actionable information.
