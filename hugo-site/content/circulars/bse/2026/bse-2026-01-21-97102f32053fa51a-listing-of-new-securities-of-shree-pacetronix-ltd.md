## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment to promoters represents a relatively small issuance that increases the paid-up capital. The mandatory lock-in period until August 2027 prevents immediate trading of these shares, limiting any short-term supply impact. The shares rank equally with existing shares, maintaining uniform shareholder rights. This type of promoter funding through preferential allotment is a standard corporate finance activity with no material operational or trading implications for the broader market.
