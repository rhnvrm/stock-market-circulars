## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. Both clarifications confirm that information was already disclosed through proper channels and no new material information is being revealed. Share price movements are attributed to market forces rather than undisclosed information.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. The clarifications are procedural in nature, confirming compliance with disclosure norms. Oil India's composite license execution is part of normal business operations during the licensing phase.

**Investor Impact**: These clarifications provide transparency regarding news articles but do not materially change the information landscape for investors, as the relevant information was already publicly available through prior disclosures.
