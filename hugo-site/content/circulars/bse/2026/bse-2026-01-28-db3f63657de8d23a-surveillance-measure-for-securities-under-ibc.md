## Summary

BSE has issued surveillance measures for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) framework effective January 29, 2026. One security, Silveroak Commercials Ltd (Scrip Code: 512197, ISIN: INE798C01017), has been shortlisted in Stage 1 of Additional Surveillance Measure for Companies relating to the Insolvency Resolution Process. No securities are moving between other stages or being excluded from the framework.

## Key Points

- Silveroak Commercials Ltd added to IBC Stage 1 surveillance effective January 29, 2026
- No securities added to Stage 0 (Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure)
- No securities moving from Stage I to Stage II or vice versa
- No securities being excluded from ASM for IBC
- Consolidated list includes 14+ securities under various IBC stages, including companies like Aban Offshore Ltd, Alchemist Ltd, Ansal Properties & Infrastructure Ltd, and others

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework for companies undergoing Insolvency Resolution Process as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The framework operates in stages:

- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company
- **Stage 1**: Additional Surveillance Measure for Companies relating to IRP as per IBC
- **Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance measures

Securities can move between stages based on developments in insolvency proceedings.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note the surveillance status of Silveroak Commercials Ltd
- Investors should exercise caution when trading securities under IBC surveillance framework
- Listed companies under insolvency proceedings must comply with disclosure requirements
- Trading members must adhere to applicable surveillance measures for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 29, 2026 - Silveroak Commercials Ltd moves to IBC Stage 1 surveillance

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited immediate market impact as only one security is newly added to Stage 1 surveillance. However, investors in Silveroak Commercials Ltd should be aware of the company's insolvency proceedings.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under IBC surveillance may experience reduced liquidity and heightened volatility as market participants factor in insolvency risks. The consolidated list shows multiple securities remain under various stages of IBC surveillance.

**Investor Impact**: Heightened risk for investors in affected securities due to potential outcomes of insolvency proceedings, including restructuring, resolution, or liquidation. The surveillance framework provides transparency on companies facing financial distress.
