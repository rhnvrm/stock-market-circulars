title: Suspension of Trading in Debentures of SAMVARDHANA MOTHERSON INTERNATIONAL
  LIMITED
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a notice suspending trading in specific non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of Samvardhana Motherson International Limited effective January 8, 2026. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the no-dealings date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies to debentures with ISIN INE775A08089 (Code: 974555)
- Debenture series: SMIL-8.15%-23-1-26-PVT
- Record date set for January 8, 2026
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- No dealings permitted from January 8, 2026 onwards
- Notice reference: DR-794/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action notification for debenture redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from January 8, 2026
- Members are required to take note of the suspension and inform their clients accordingly
- Only holders on record as of January 8, 2026 will be eligible for interest payment and redemption proceeds

## Important Dates

- **January 1, 2026**: Notice date
- **January 8, 2026**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **January 8, 2026**: No dealings date (trading suspension effective from this date)

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of the specific debenture series (SMIL-8.15%-23-1-26-PVT). This is a routine corporate action that does not affect the company's equity shares or other debt instruments. Debenture holders on record will receive their interest payment and redemption proceeds as per the debenture terms. The suspension ensures orderly settlement and prevents trading after the record date cutoff. No broader market impact anticipated.
