## Regulatory Changes

The trading segment classification for GRE RENEW ENERTECH LIMITED shares will be upgraded from MT Group (Trade for Trade) to M Group (Rolling segment). This represents a transition from a more restrictive trading framework to a standard rolling settlement mechanism.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must update their systems to reflect the new segment classification
- All trading in the scrip must comply with M Group rules from the effective date
- Trading Members should contact the designated BSE official for clarification on operational details

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 21, 2026

- **Effective Date**: February 04, 2026 (Wednesday)

## Impact Assessment

The transfer from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment is generally positive for the stock's liquidity. Trade for Trade segment requires full upfront delivery and payment, limiting intraday trading and leverage. Moving to Rolling segment (M Group) allows for:

- Increased liquidity through standard T+2 settlement
- Ability for intraday trading
- Greater participation from institutional and retail investors
- Improved price discovery mechanism

This change typically occurs after a company demonstrates stable trading patterns post-IPO and is considered a normal progression for SME-listed companies.
