## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational notice pursuant to the maturity of government Treasury Bills listed on the BSE Debt segment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealing in the three mentioned T-Bills with effect from March 2, 2026
- Members should update their systems and client communications to reflect the suspension of these instruments

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 27, 2026
- **Suspension Effective Date:** March 2, 2026 (Redemption Date)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine maturity-driven suspension with limited market impact. The three T-Bills — covering 91-day, 182-day, and 364-day tenors — have reached their redemption dates. Holders of these instruments will receive redemption proceeds as per standard government securities settlement processes. No adverse market impact is expected; trading members simply need to ensure no new trades are executed in these scrips from March 2, 2026 onward.
