## Summary

BSE has notified members that Trust Mutual Fund will offer TRUSTMF MID CAP FUND as a New Fund Offer (NFO) with SIP facility on the BSE StAR MF Platform. The NFO subscription window runs from February 27, 2026, to March 13, 2026, with tentative unit allotment on March 20, 2026. Both Direct and Regular Growth plans are available under the Equity category.

## Key Points

- NFO period: February 27, 2026 to March 13, 2026 on BSE StAR MF Platform
- Two schemes offered: TRUSTMF MID CAP FUND - Direct Plan - Growth (ISIN: INF0GCD01875) and Regular Plan - Growth (ISIN: INF0GCD01883)
- Both schemes fall under the Equity category with tentative allotment date of March 20, 2026
- NFO extended till midnight on March 13, 2026 for lumpsum purchases only on BSE StAR MF Platform

- Transactions where client has not initiated funds by 9:00 AM on T+1 day will be cancelled; CC with N flag will be reported to RTA/AMC

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular operationalises an existing NFO launch framework for mutual fund transactions on BSE StAR MF Platform.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must ensure client funds are initiated within the T+1 deadline (9:00 AM) to avoid cancellation
- Clear funds must be available in the ICCL Account by 6:00 PM on March 19, 2026 for unit allotment
- Cheques and OTM payments are acceptable during the NFO period only if clear funds are received in ICCL account by 6:00 PM on March 19, 2026
- Switch-out transactions must have funds received under the NFO scheme before the allotment date; funds received on or after the allotment date will not be considered
- Pending transactions (where payment has been initiated) remain in the system until 3:00 PM on the last day of funds payout to AMC, or T+5, whichever is earlier

## Important Dates

- **February 27, 2026**: NFO subscription opens
- **March 13, 2026**: NFO subscription closes (extended till midnight for lumpsum purchases); SIP/XSIP authentication deadline: 3:00 PM
- **March 19, 2026**: Deadline for clear funds in ICCL Account — 6:00 PM
- **March 20, 2026**: Tentative allotment date for both Direct and Regular Plan - Growth schemes

## Impact Assessment

This circular has low market impact as it is a routine operational notice for BSE members facilitating mutual fund transactions. It affects members on the BSE StAR MF Platform who process NFO subscriptions, SIP registrations, and switch transactions for Trust Mutual Fund. Members should update their systems with the NFO details and communicate payment and authentication deadlines to clients to avoid transaction cancellations.
