## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that 99,722 new equity shares of UPL Ltd (Scrip Code: 512070) will be available for trading from Wednesday, February 4, 2026.

- ISIN: INE628A01036
- Origin: Conversion of partly paid shares to fully paid up shares on rights basis
- Status: Pari-passu with existing equity shares
- Trading permitted from: February 4, 2026

## Distinctive Number Allocation

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: February 3, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing of 99,722 shares represents a minimal increase to UPL Ltd's equity capital base. This is a routine corporate action resulting from the conversion of partly paid shares to fully paid shares under a rights issue. The small quantum of shares and pari-passu nature means negligible impact on stock liquidity, price discovery, or market operations. Trading members need only perform standard system updates to accommodate the new distinctive number ranges.
