**Shareholder Impact**: Positive for eligible shareholders who may have faced time constraints during the holiday season. Provides additional opportunity to exercise rights and maintain ownership proportions.

**Timeline Impact**: All post-issue activities delayed by 2-3 business days. Expected listing date moved from January 7, 2026 to January 12, 2026, accounting for weekend.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Extension is a common practice and does not indicate any issues with the rights issue process. The company has maintained all other terms of the offer unchanged.
