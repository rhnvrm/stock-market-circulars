## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - Demat auctions are routine settlement mechanisms affecting only specific members with delivery failures.

**Operational Impact:** Low to Medium for affected members - Those with delivery obligations must fulfill requirements through auction process, potentially at unfavorable prices.

**Investor Impact:** Minimal - Does not affect regular market trading or investor portfolios unless they are direct counterparties to settlement failures.

## Affected Scrips Details

The auction covers 89 scrips including major companies like State Bank of India (1 share), BHEL (483 shares), Larsen & Toubro (14 shares), IndusInd Bank (57 shares), and various mid and small-cap companies. The wide range of quantities suggests isolated delivery failures rather than systemic settlement issues.
