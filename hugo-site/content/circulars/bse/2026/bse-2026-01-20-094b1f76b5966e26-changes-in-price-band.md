## Impact Assessment

The revised price bands indicate enhanced surveillance measures on these securities. Tighter price bands (particularly the 2% band on Bits Ltd) restrict intraday price movement, reducing volatility and protecting investors. This typically signals concerns about price manipulation, unusual trading activity, or corporate governance issues. Trading volumes may be affected as the restricted bands limit speculative trading opportunities.
