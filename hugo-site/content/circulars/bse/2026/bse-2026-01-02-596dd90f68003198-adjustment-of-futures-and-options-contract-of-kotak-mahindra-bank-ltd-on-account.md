## Regulatory Changes

This adjustment is implemented in pursuance of SEBI guidelines for adjustment of Futures & Options Contracts on announcement of corporate actions. The exchange is mandated to make necessary adjustments to ensure fair continuation of derivative contracts following stock splits.

## Compliance Requirements

### For Trading Members:
- Be aware of automatic adjustments to all KOTB F&O contracts
- Update systems and risk management tools to reflect new contract specifications
- Inform clients holding KOTB derivative positions about the adjustments
- Contact designated Relationship Managers for any clarifications

### Contract Adjustments:

**Strike Price Adjustment:**
- Existing strike prices divided by adjustment factor (5)
- Example: Strike 2100 becomes 420, Strike 2120 becomes 424, Strike 2140 becomes 428, Strike 2160 becomes 432

**Market Lot Adjustment:**
- Existing market lot (400) multiplied by adjustment factor (5)
- Revised market lot: 2000 shares per contract

**Position Adjustment:**
- All existing positions multiplied by adjustment factor (5)

**Futures Price Adjustment:**
- Existing futures prices divided by adjustment factor (5)
- Adjusted prices rounded to nearest tick size

## Important Dates

- **January 13, 2026**: Adjustments to be implemented at end of day
- **January 14, 2026**: Record date for stock split; Ex-date for adjusted contracts

## Impact Assessment

### Market Impact:
- **High impact** on all traders holding Kotak Mahindra Bank F&O positions
- Automatic 5x increase in number of contracts held (due to position multiplication)
- Significant change in strike price granularity (all strikes divided by 5)
- Market lot increases from 400 to 2000 shares per contract
- No change in total notional value of positions (adjustment is value-neutral)

### Operational Impact:
- Trading systems must accommodate new strike prices and lot sizes
- Margin requirements will adjust automatically based on new contract specifications
- Risk management systems need updates for new contract parameters
- Client reporting systems must reflect adjusted positions accurately

### Trader Considerations:
- Existing positions remain economically equivalent after adjustment
- Option strategies (spreads, straddles, etc.) will be adjusted proportionally
- Premium values will be adjusted to reflect new strike prices and lot sizes
- Open interest will be redistributed across new strike prices
