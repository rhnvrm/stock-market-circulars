## Summary

The seller will now offer a total of 7,00,90,556 units (7.36% of unit capital) instead of the original base offer of 4,36,31,371 units (4.58%). The offer is being conducted through the stock exchange mechanism with separate windows for non-retail investors (February 05, 2026) and retail investors (February 06, 2026).

- Total offer size increased from 4.58% to 7.36% of IndiGrid's unit capital
- Total units being offered: 7,00,90,556 units
- Base Offer Units: 4,36,31,371 units (4.58%)
- Oversubscription Option: 2,64,59,185 units (2.78%)
- 70,09,057 units reserved for retail investors (10% of total offer)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a notification of oversubscription option exercise under the existing offer for sale framework through stock exchange mechanism.

## Compliance Requirements

- Stock exchanges (BSE and NSE) to allocate reserved units to retail investors on T+1 Day
- Allocation subject to receipt of valid bids
- Separate trading windows to be maintained for retail and non-retail investors
- All terms and conditions as per the original Notice dated February 04, 2026 remain applicable

## Important Dates

- **February 04, 2026**: Original notice date for offer for sale
- **February 05, 2026 (T Day)**: Offer window for non-retail investors only
- **February 06, 2026 (T+1 Day)**: Offer window for retail investors and non-retail investors with un-allotted bids from T Day
- **February 05, 2026**: Date of oversubscription option exercise notification

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The increased offer size of 7.36% of IndiGrid's unit capital represents a substantial secondary market transaction. The Government of Singapore is divesting a significant portion of its holdings, which may impact unit price depending on demand-supply dynamics.

**Investor Impact**: Retail investors have a dedicated allocation of approximately 70 lakh units (10% of offer) on T+1 Day. Non-retail investors get early access on T Day with carry-forward option for un-allotted bids.

**Liquidity Impact**: The offer through stock exchange mechanism ensures transparent price discovery and provides exit opportunity to the selling unitholder while offering investment opportunity to new investors. The staggered approach (non-retail first, then retail) helps manage market impact.
