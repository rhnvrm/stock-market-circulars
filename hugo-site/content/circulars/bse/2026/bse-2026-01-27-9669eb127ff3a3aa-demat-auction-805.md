---

## Summary

BSE has published the list of securities scheduled for demat auction under Settlement No. 805 dated January 27, 2026. The auction includes 98 scrips with varying quantities that will be auctioned to fulfill delivery obligations that could not be met through normal settlement processes.

## Key Points

- Settlement Number: 805
- Settlement Date: January 27, 2026
- Total number of securities listed: 98 scrips
- Includes major stocks like Adani Power (250 shares), Kotak Mahindra Bank (1,000 shares), Punjab National Bank (3,000 shares), and Suzlon Energy (1,000 shares)
- Quantities range from 1 share to 10,422 shares across different scrips
- Covers diverse sectors including banking, power, automotive, steel, and consumer goods

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine operational circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers and clearing members with shortages in the listed securities must participate in the demat auction
- Settlement obligations must be fulfilled through the auction mechanism
- Participants must ensure availability of funds for auction purchases

## Important Dates

- **Settlement Date**: January 27, 2026
- **Auction Date**: As per standard BSE auction schedule for Settlement No. 805

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. Demat auctions are routine settlement mechanisms to handle failed deliveries. The quantities involved are relatively small compared to daily trading volumes for most listed securities.

**Operational Impact**: Limited to brokers and clearing members who have failed to deliver securities in the normal settlement cycle. They will need to purchase these securities through the auction process, potentially at premium prices.

**Investor Impact**: Minimal direct impact on retail investors. The auction mechanism ensures market integrity by forcing delivery completion.
