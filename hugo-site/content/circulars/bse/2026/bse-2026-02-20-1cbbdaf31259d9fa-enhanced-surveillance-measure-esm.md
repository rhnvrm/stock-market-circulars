title: BSE Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework Update - February 23, 2026

## Summary

The circular covers four categories of changes: 2 securities newly shortlisted into ESM, 7 securities moved to higher ESM stages, 9 securities moved to lower ESM stages, and 18 securities exiting the ESM framework entirely.

## Key Points

- 2 securities newly added to ESM framework: JITF Infralogistics Ltd (540311) and Vistar Amar Ltd (538565)
- 7 securities escalated to higher ESM stages, indicating continued or worsening surveillance concerns
- 9 securities downgraded to lower ESM stages, indicating partial improvement in surveillance parameters
- 18 securities exiting ESM framework entirely, including 2 SME scrips (Asarfi Hospital Ltd, Retaggio Industries Ltd)

- Participants should refer to the consolidated Annexure III list for the complete current ESM stage of all securities under the framework

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 20, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 23, 2026 (all ESM changes take effect)

## Impact Assessment

This circular has high market impact as it affects 36 securities across BSE. Newly added and stage-escalated securities (9 total) will face tighter trading restrictions, reduced liquidity, and increased margin requirements, making them less accessible to retail investors. The 18 securities exiting ESM will see improved trading conditions and potential liquidity recovery. Stage downgrades for 9 securities signal gradual normalization. The inclusion of SME scrips highlights continued surveillance focus on smaller companies. Investors holding ESM-listed securities should review applicable trading restrictions and margin obligations before February 23, 2026.
