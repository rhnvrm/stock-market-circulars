## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects debt market participants holding or trading these commercial papers. No impact on equity trading of these companies.

**Operational Impact**: Routine corporate action with standard operational procedures. Trading members must update their systems to block trading in these instruments.

**Investor Impact**: Holders of these commercial papers will receive redemption proceeds as per terms. Secondary market liquidity ceases from the no-dealings dates, but this is standard practice for maturing debt instruments.

**Sector Impact**: Concentration of financial services companies (NBFCs, housing finance, brokerages) indicates normal course redemption activity in the financial sector's commercial paper market.
