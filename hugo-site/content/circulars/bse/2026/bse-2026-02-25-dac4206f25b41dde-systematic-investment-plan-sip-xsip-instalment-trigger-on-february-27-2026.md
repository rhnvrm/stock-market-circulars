## Summary

BSE has issued a notice (No. 20260225-26) regarding the triggering of SIP/XSIP instalments for February 2026. Due to February 28, 2026 falling on a 4th Saturday (a non-business day) and the month of February not having 29th or 30th dates, all monthly and quarterly SIP/XSIP instalments with due dates of 28th, 29th, or 30th will be triggered early on **Friday, February 27, 2026**.

## Key Points

- SIP/XSIP instalments due on the 28th, 29th, and 30th of February 2026 will be triggered on **February 27, 2026**
- February 28, 2026 is a 4th Saturday and hence a non-business day
- February 2026 does not have 29th or 30th as calendar dates
- Affects all Monthly and Quarterly frequency SIP/XSIP registrations on BSE StAR MF platform
- Members must inform clients to maintain sufficient bank balances by February 27, 2026
- Members using their own payment aggregators must ensure fund collection is completed within order validity

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a one-time operational adjustment for February 2026 to accommodate the calendar anomaly where the month ends on a non-business day and lacks 29th/30th dates.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Members/Brokers**: Notify clients to maintain adequate bank balances ahead of February 27, 2026
- **Members using own payment aggregators**: Ensure collection from investor bank accounts to ICCL bank account is completed within the validity period of such orders
- Queries can be directed to BSE Mutual Fund Helpdesk: 022-45720450/650 & 022-69158550 (business days, 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM)
- Queries can also be raised via the CRS portal: https://bsecrs.bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **February 27, 2026 (Friday)**: Instalment trigger date for all SIP/XSIP due on 28th, 29th, and 30th of February 2026
- **February 28, 2026 (Saturday)**: 4th Saturday — non-business day, original due date for 28th instalments

## Impact Assessment

This notice has a moderate operational impact on mutual fund investors and BSE StAR MF platform members. Investors with SIP/XSIP mandates set for month-end dates (28th, 29th, 30th) must ensure their bank accounts are funded a day earlier than usual. Members and payment aggregators need to coordinate fund collection timelines accordingly. Failure to maintain sufficient balance on February 27 could result in SIP instalment failures for the month, potentially affecting investment continuity for affected investors.
