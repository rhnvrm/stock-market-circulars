## Impact Assessment

The listing of 2,50,000 new equity shares represents a small preferential allotment for Captain Polyplast Limited. Since all newly listed shares are under lock-in until September 15, 2026, there is no immediate incremental free-float addition to the market. The impact on trading volumes and price discovery is minimal in the near term. Post lock-in expiry, the additional shares could marginally increase liquidity in the counter.
