## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected as this is a preferential allotment to promoters following warrant conversion. The shares represent a relatively small addition to the company's equity base and are subject to a lock-in period until July 2027, preventing immediate trading by the allottees. This is a routine corporate action with no immediate liquidity or price implications for the broader market.
