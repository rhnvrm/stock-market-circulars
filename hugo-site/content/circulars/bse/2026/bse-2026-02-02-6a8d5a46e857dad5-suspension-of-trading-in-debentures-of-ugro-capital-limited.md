title: Suspension of Trading in Debentures of UGRO CAPITAL LIMITED
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of UGRO CAPITAL LIMITED with ISIN INE583D07448 (Code: 939286) effective February 12, 2026. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are strictly advised not to deal in these debentures from the specified date.

## Key Points

- ISIN: INE583D07448
- BSE Code: 939286
- Coupon Rate: 10.35%
- Maturity Date: February 27, 2026
- Record Date: February 12, 2026
- No Dealings Period: Starts February 12, 2026
- Notice Reference: DR-819/2025-2026
- Notice Date: February 02, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard operational measure applied when a company sets a record date for debenture redemption and interest payment to prevent trading during the settlement period.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealings in the specified debentures from February 12, 2026
- No buy or sell orders should be accepted for ISIN INE583D07448 after the suspension date
- Trading members must inform their clients holding or intending to trade these debentures about the suspension
- Debenture holders should ensure their demat accounts are updated for interest payment and redemption proceeds

## Important Dates

- **February 02, 2026**: Circular issued by BSE
- **February 12, 2026**: Trading suspension begins / Record date for interest and redemption
- **February 27, 2026**: Debenture maturity date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High impact for current debenture holders as liquidity is completely removed from February 12, 2026 onwards. Investors wishing to exit their positions must do so before the suspension date. The debentures are approaching maturity (27 days from notice date), which limits the trading window significantly.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to reject orders for this ISIN from February 12, 2026. Compliance teams need to ensure no inadvertent trades occur during the suspension period.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will receive their final interest payment and principal redemption as per the record date. No further trading opportunity will be available, making this a mandatory hold-to-maturity situation for positions held after February 12, 2026.
