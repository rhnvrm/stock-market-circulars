## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. These are routine ESOP/ESOS conversions that result in marginal dilution of existing equity. The largest issuance is Yes Bank (893,540 shares) which represents negligible percentage of its outstanding shares.

**Liquidity Impact:** Neutral to slightly positive as additional freely tradable shares enter the market with no lock-in restrictions.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders will experience minimal dilution. ESOP issuances are standard corporate practice for employee compensation and retention.
