title: Extension for Upload of Client Records to KRAs for Validations
---

## Summary

BSE has extended the deadline for trading members to upload client KYC records to KYC Registration Agencies (KRAs) to April 03, 2026, following multiple requests from trading members. SEBI originally mandated a 3-working-day timeline for KYC uploads as per circular dated October 12, 2023. A sample verification revealed several trading members have not complied with this requirement. Only clients with KRA status of "KYC Registered" or "KYC Validated" are permitted to trade. Non-compliant PANs will be restricted from trading and will not be allowed to square off open positions after the deadline.

## Key Points

- Deadline extended to April 03, 2026 for uploading client KYC records to KRAs
- Original SEBI requirement mandated 3-working-day timeline from completion of KYC process (SEBI Circular dated October 12, 2023)
- Sample comparison revealed multiple trading members have not complied with the revised timeline
- Only clients with "KYC Registered" or "KYC Validated" status permitted to trade
- Non-validated PANs will be restricted from trading and squaring off open positions
- Trading members must monitor open positions of non-compliant clients
- Members should contact respective KRAs for queries on client KRA status

## Regulatory Changes

The circular references the evolution of KYC upload timelines:

1. **Original requirement (2011)**: SEBI Circular MIRSD/Cir-26/2011 dated December 23, 2011 required intermediaries to upload KYC to KRAs within 10 working days from execution of documents by client

2. **Revised timeline (2023)**: SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/SECFATF/P/CIR/2023/169 dated October 12, 2023 reduced this to 3 working days from completion of KYC process

3. **Trading permissions**: SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/FATF/P/CIR/2023/0144 dated August 11, 2023 allows clients to transact upon KYC completion, but clients whose KYC attributes cannot be verified must not transact until verification is completed

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**

- Upload all pending client KYC records to KRAs by April 03, 2026
- Ensure all trading clients have KRA status of "KYC Registered" or "KYC Validated"
- Closely monitor open positions of clients with non-validated KRA status
- Take appropriate measures to ensure compliance before the deadline
- Contact respective KRAs directly for any queries or issues related to client KRA status
- Ensure seamless interoperability across market participants

**For Clients:**

- Clients without validated KRA status will not be permitted to trade on the Exchange
