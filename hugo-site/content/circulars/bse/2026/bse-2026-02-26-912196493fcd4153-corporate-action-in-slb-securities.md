title: Corporate Actions in SLB Securities - Dividends, Stock Split, and Rights Issue
---

## Summary

BSE has notified corporate actions for securities available in the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) segment. Four securities are affected with actions including dividends, a stock split, and a rights issue, with shut periods and ex-dates spanning from 26 February to 13 March 2026. SLB participants holding positions in these securities must take note of the associated shut periods and foreclosure dates.

## Key Points

- Angel One Limited undergoes a **Stock Split** with ex-date on 26-February-2026 (today), with shut period 25-Feb to 26-Feb-2026
- SBI Life Insurance Company Limited announces a **Dividend** with record date 06-March-2026 and shut period 05-Mar to 06-Mar-2026
- Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) announces a **Dividend** with record date 13-March-2026 and shut period 12-Mar to 13-Mar-2026
- HealthCare Global Enterprises Limited announces a **Rights Issue of Equity Shares** with record date 02-March-2026, foreclosure date 02-Mar-2026, and shut period 27-Feb to 02-Mar-2026
- SLB positions in these securities are subject to mandatory shut periods during which lending/borrowing is restricted

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular is an operational notification under existing SLB framework rules requiring disclosure of upcoming corporate actions affecting lendable securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- SLB participants (lenders and borrowers) must unwind or settle open positions in affected securities before the respective shut periods commence
- For HealthCare Global Enterprises, participants must note the foreclosure date of 02-Mar-2026, by which open SLB positions must be closed
- Clearing members should ensure clients are informed of shut period restrictions to avoid settlement issues

## Important Dates

| Security | Action | Ex/Record Date | Foreclosure Date | Shut Period |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Angel One Limited | Stock Split | 26-Feb-2026 | — | 25-Feb-2026 to 26-Feb-2026 |
| HealthCare Global Enterprises | Rights Issue | 02-Mar-2026 | 02-Mar-2026 | 27-Feb-2026 to 02-Mar-2026 |
| SBI Life Insurance | Dividend | 06-Mar-2026 | — | 05-Mar-2026 to 06-Mar-2026 |
| IRFC | Dividend | 13-Mar-2026 | — | 12-Mar-2026 to 13-Mar-2026 |

## Impact Assessment

The immediate impact is on Angel One Limited, whose stock split ex-date falls on 26-February-2026 (the date of this circular), meaning SLB positions should already be settled. HealthCare Global Enterprises' rights issue requires attention by 27-February-2026 (shut period start) with a firm foreclosure deadline. SLB participants with open positions in any of these four securities face mandatory closure or settlement obligations within the coming two weeks. Market participants should review their SLB books for exposure to these securities promptly.
