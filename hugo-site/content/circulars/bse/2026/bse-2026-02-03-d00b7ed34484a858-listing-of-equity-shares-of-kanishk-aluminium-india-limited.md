## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The staggered lock-in structure means only 29.8% of shares are immediately tradeable, which may lead to higher price volatility due to limited float. Liquidity will improve gradually as locked-in tranches are released over the three-year period.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Standard listing procedure with clear lock-in specifications that trading systems can easily accommodate.

**Investor Impact**: Medium. Investors should be aware that majority of shares are locked-in, affecting available supply and potentially price discovery in the initial trading period.
