**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in free float for each company. The largest single listing is 337,504 shares for Dr. Agarwal's Health Care Limited.

**Investor Impact**: No immediate action required. These shares are available for trading immediately without restrictions, representing typical equity dilution from employee compensation programs.
