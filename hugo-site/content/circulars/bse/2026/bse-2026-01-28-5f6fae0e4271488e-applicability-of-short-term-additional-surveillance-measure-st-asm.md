The ST-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance to securities exhibiting unusual price movements or trading patterns over short periods (5/15/30 days).

## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term ASM framework applies additional surveillance measures including:
- Enhanced monitoring of price movements and trading patterns
- Potential trading restrictions based on stage classification (Stage I, II, etc.)
- Different treatment for SME securities and T+0 settlement scrips
- Securities may graduate to other frameworks (LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM) based on continued surveillance findings

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of securities under ST-ASM and applicable restrictions
- Investors should note enhanced surveillance status when trading these securities
- Securities under ST-ASM may have additional margin requirements or trade-to-trade settlement
- Brokers must ensure proper risk disclosure to clients trading ST-ASM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** January 29, 2026 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable
- **Circular Date:** January 28, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects specific securities with unusual trading patterns, limiting speculative activity and protecting investor interests. The framework's short-term nature (5/15/30 days) allows for dynamic monitoring.

**Trading Impact:** Securities under ST-ASM face enhanced scrutiny and potential trading restrictions, which may reduce liquidity and increase bid-ask spreads for affected stocks.

**Investor Impact:** Retail investors holding or trading these securities should exercise caution and be aware of elevated surveillance status, which typically indicates higher volatility or irregular price movements.

**Compliance Impact:** Trading members must update their systems and risk management frameworks to reflect the updated ST-ASM list and ensure appropriate client disclosures.
