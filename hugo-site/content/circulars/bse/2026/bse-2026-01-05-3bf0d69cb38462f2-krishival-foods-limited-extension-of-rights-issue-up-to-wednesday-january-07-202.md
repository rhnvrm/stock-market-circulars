## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The extension provides existing shareholders additional time to participate in the Rights Issue, potentially increasing subscription rates. The 2-day extension during holiday season demonstrates management consideration for shareholder convenience.

**Operational Impact:** The extension delays the entire post-issue timeline by 2-3 business days, including allotment and listing dates. Companies and registrars need to adjust their operational schedules accordingly.

**Shareholder Impact:** Positive for shareholders who may have missed the original deadline due to holiday season. Provides additional opportunity to exercise rights and maintain proportional ownership in the company.
