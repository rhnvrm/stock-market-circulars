## Impact Assessment

Holders of debentures issued by Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited and Prosperity Asset 9 Trust will no longer be able to trade these instruments on BSE from February 27, 2026. This is a direct consequence of the instruments reaching redemption or the issuer initiating a delisting process. The impact is high for existing debenture holders who may seek liquidity, as the secondary market route on BSE will be unavailable. Trading members must act immediately to comply with the directive.
