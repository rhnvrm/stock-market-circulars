## Summary

BSE has issued Notice No. 20260227-24 informing trading members that ANNVRRIDHHI VENTURES LTD (Scrip Code: 890229) has cancelled the Record Date of February 27, 2026 that was previously set for determining holders of Partly Paid Rights Equity Shares (PPS) entitled to receive the First Call Notice. The Rights Committee of the company resolved on February 26, 2026 to withdraw the earlier resolution dated February 23, 2026 that had approved the First Call of Rs.2.50 per partly paid-up equity share. Trading in the company's PPS will resume from March 2, 2026.

## Key Points

- Original notice (Exchange Notice No. 20260224-38, dated February 24, 2026) had fixed Record Date as February 27, 2026 for First Call on PPS
- ANNVRRIDHHI VENTURES LTD's Rights Committee met on February 26, 2026 and rescinded the resolution approving the First Call
- First Call amount cancelled: Rs.2.50 per partly paid-up equity share (face value Rs.10/- each)
- Record Date of February 27, 2026 stands withdrawn as a consequence
- Reason for cancellation: internal review of the call schedule
- No Call Notice had been dispatched prior to cancellation
- No call money had become due or payable
- An advertisement relating to the earlier record date was published in newspapers on February 24, 2026
- Trading in PPS (Scrip Code: 890229) will resume with effect from March 2, 2026
- DR reference: (831/2025-2026)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This notice reverses a previously announced corporate action (First Call on Partly Paid Shares) and reinstates normal trading in the PPS segment for the affected scrip.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are required to take note of the cancellation of the record date and the First Call for Scrip Code 890229
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the resumption of trading in PPS of ANNVRRIDHHI VENTURES LTD from March 2, 2026
- No action is required from shareholders in relation to the cancelled First Call, as no call money was due or payable

## Important Dates

- **February 23, 2026**: Original Rights Committee resolution approving First Call passed
- **February 24, 2026**: Exchange Notice No. 20260224-38 issued; newspaper advertisement published regarding record date
- **February 26, 2026**: Rights Committee meeting rescinding First Call resolution
- **February 27, 2026**: Cancelled Record Date; BSE Notice No. 20260227-24 issued
- **March 2, 2026**: Resumption of trading in PPS of ANNVRRIDHHI VENTURES LTD (Scrip Code: 890229)

## Impact Assessment

The cancellation of the First Call and associated record date has a moderate impact on existing holders of Partly Paid Shares (PPS) of ANNVRRIDHHI VENTURES LTD. Since no Call Notice was dispatched and no call money had become due or payable, shareholders face no immediate financial obligation. However, the revised call schedule introduces uncertainty for investors who had anticipated the timing of the First Call. The resumption of trading in PPS from March 2, 2026 restores market liquidity for this instrument. The impact is limited to holders and prospective traders of Scrip Code 890229 and does not have broader market implications.
