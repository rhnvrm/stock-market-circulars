## Regulatory Framework

The ST-ASM framework is part of BSE's surveillance mechanism to monitor securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or unusual trading patterns. Securities under this framework may face enhanced surveillance measures including:

- Trade-for-trade settlement
- Higher margins
- Restrictions on certain types of trading
- Enhanced disclosure requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 20, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The inclusion of securities in ST-ASM typically results in reduced liquidity due to additional trading restrictions and margin requirements. Investors holding these securities should be aware of potential impact on trading volumes and price discovery.

**Investor Impact**: Traders and investors in the affected securities will experience:
- Potential increase in trading costs due to higher margins
- Reduced intraday trading opportunities
- Enhanced monitoring and compliance requirements

**Transitional Impact**: Seven securities exiting the framework may see improved liquidity, though some are transitioning to the Long Term ASM framework which continues surveillance under different parameters.
