## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that MAS Financial Services Limited has fixed 06 March 2026 as the record date for part redemption and interest payment on two series of Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs). Trading in these debentures will occur with a reduced face value effective from 06 March 2026 under settlement DR-834/2025-2026.

## Key Points

- Two NCD series of MAS Financial Services Limited are subject to part redemption and interest payment.
- **Series 1:** MFSL-3 Months Bank MCLR-21-3-2 (ISIN: INE348L07183, Code: 975528) — reduced face value of Rs. 50,000 per debenture.
- **Series 2:** MFSL-1 MMCLR OF IDFC FIRST Bank (ISIN: INE348L07282, Code: 976525) — reduced face value of Rs. 75,000 per debenture.
- Record date for both series: 06 March 2026.
- Effective date for reduced face value trading: 06 March 2026.
- Settlement number: DR-834/2025-2026.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action notification under BSE's debt market listing compliance framework requiring updated face value trading post partial redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note and update their systems to reflect the reduced face values for both NCD series effective 06 March 2026.
- All trades in these debentures from the effective date must be executed at the reduced face value as specified.
- Members should ensure proper settlement under DR-834/2025-2026 for both series.

## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Circular Date | 23 February 2026 |
| Record Date (both series) | 06 March 2026 |
| Effective Date for Reduced Face Value | 06 March 2026 |
| Settlement Number | DR-834/2025-2026 |

## Impact Assessment

This action affects holders and traders of two specific NCD series issued by MAS Financial Services Limited on BSE's debt market segment. The partial redemption reduces the outstanding principal (face value) of each debenture — Series 1 to Rs. 50,000 and Series 2 to Rs. 75,000 — while simultaneously triggering an interest payment. Market impact is limited to participants in these specific instruments; broader market impact is negligible. Trading members must update pricing and settlement systems to avoid errors from the effective date.
