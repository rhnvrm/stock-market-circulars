## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine corporate action affecting only the debt segment commercial paper market. The suspensions are temporary and related to scheduled redemptions.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to prevent inadvertent trading in suspended securities. Investors holding these commercial papers will receive redemption proceeds as per terms.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to holders of the specific commercial papers who will have their investments redeemed on the respective record dates. No trading opportunity loss as these are near-maturity instruments.
