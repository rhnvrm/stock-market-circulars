## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for new securities issued under preferential allotment regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the new securities are available for trading from February 6, 2026
- All 8,89,49,900 shares are subject to mandatory lock-in restrictions
- Lock-in compliance must be maintained until August 15, 2026
- Shares cannot be transferred or traded by allottees during the lock-in period

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: October 9, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: February 6, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry**: August 15, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Dilution Impact**: The preferential issue represents a significant capital raise for Mirc Electronics Ltd. With nearly 89 million new shares issued to non-promoters, existing shareholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage.

**Market Impact**: Medium impact as the shares are locked-in until August 15, 2026, preventing immediate selling pressure. However, the substantial increase in share capital (approximately Rs. 149.5 crores at issue price) indicates significant fundraising that may be used for business expansion or debt reduction.

**Trading Implications**: While shares are technically listed, the lock-in restriction means these specific shares will not be available for trading until mid-August 2026, limiting immediate liquidity impact on the scrip.
