Transferred securities will be credited only in demat mode and will be subject to a mandatory one-year lock-in period from the date of transfer registration.

- Helps investors secure rightful access to their securities
- Facilitates ease of investing and protects investor rights
- Offers second chance for previously rejected transfer requests

**Operational Impacts:**
- RTAs and listed companies must establish processes to handle transfer requests under this special window
- Enhanced verification requirements for identity and signatures
- One-year lock-in creates restrictions on transferability, protecting against fraudulent transfers
- Workload increase expected for RTAs during the window period

**Limitations:**
- Dispute cases between transferor and transferee must be settled through court/NCLT process
- IEPF-transferred securities are excluded
- Original certificates must be available (no duplicate certificate route through this window)
- Transfer deeds must have been executed before April 1, 2019
