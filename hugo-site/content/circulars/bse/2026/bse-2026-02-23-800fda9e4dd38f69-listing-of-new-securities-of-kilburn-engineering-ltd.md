## Impact Assessment

The listing of 3,50,000 new shares represents a modest equity dilution for existing shareholders of Kilburn Engineering Ltd. At an issue price of Rs. 425/-, the preferential allotment raised approximately Rs. 14.875 crore. Since all newly listed shares are subject to lock-in periods (until August 2026 or August 2027), there is no immediate increase in tradable float. Market impact is minimal in the near term. Longer-term, unlock events in August 2026 and August 2027 could introduce additional supply into the market.
