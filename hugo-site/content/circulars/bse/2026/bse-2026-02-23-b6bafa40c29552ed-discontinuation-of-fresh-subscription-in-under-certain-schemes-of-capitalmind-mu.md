title: Discontinuation of IDCW-Reinvestment Option in Capitalmind Arbitrage Fund
---

## Summary

Capitalmind Asset Management Private Limited and Capitalmind Trustee Private Limited have issued Notice cum Addendum No. 006/2025-26 to discontinue the IDCW-Reinvestment sub-option/facility under the Capitalmind Arbitrage Fund (both Direct and Regular Plans), effective 23rd February 2026. Going forward, the IDCW Option will only offer the Payout sub-option.

## Key Points

- The IDCW-Reinvestment sub-option is being discontinued across both Direct Plan and Regular Plan of Capitalmind Arbitrage Fund.
- The Growth Option and IDCW Payout sub-option remain unchanged and continue to be available.
- The scheme continues to offer two plans: Direct Plan (default when no broker code is provided) and Regular Plan.
- The common portfolio structure across all Plans/Options/Sub-options is retained.
- Default option remains Growth Option if no choice is indicated by the investor.

## Regulatory Changes

- Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) are being amended via Addendum No. 006/2025-26.
- The IDCW Option sub-options are reduced from two (Payout and Reinvestment) to one (Payout only), in accordance with SEBI (MF) Regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors currently enrolled in the IDCW-Reinvestment sub-option should take note of this change and contact Capitalmind Asset Management or their distributor to switch to an alternative option (Growth or IDCW Payout) if required.
- Distributors and intermediaries must update client records and application processing workflows to reflect the removal of the Reinvestment sub-option.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** 23rd February 2026

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited and affects only investors in the IDCW-Reinvestment sub-option of Capitalmind Arbitrage Fund. Investors in the Growth Option or IDCW Payout sub-option are not affected. This is a minor operational change with no broader market implications. Affected investors should review their investment instructions and update preferences before or on the effective date.
