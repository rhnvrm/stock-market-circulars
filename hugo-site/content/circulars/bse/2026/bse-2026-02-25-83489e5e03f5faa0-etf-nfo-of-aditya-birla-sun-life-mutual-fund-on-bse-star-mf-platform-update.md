## Summary

BSE has issued an update (Notice No. 20260225-7) revising the closing time of the ADITYA BIRLA SUN LIFE BSE TOP 10 BANKS ETF NFO on the BSE StAR MF Platform. The NFO, originally announced via Notice No. 20260220-46 dated February 20, 2026, will now close at 6:00 PM on February 25, 2026, instead of midnight as previously communicated.

## Key Points

- This is an update to the original NFO launch notice (Notice No. 20260220-46, dated February 20, 2026)
- The NFO closing time for ADITYA BIRLA SUN LIFE BSE TOP 10 BANKS ETF has been revised from midnight to **6:00 PM on February 25, 2026**
- The revision was communicated by Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund (the AMC) to BSE
- The NFO is available on the BSE StAR MF Platform
- Notice issued by Arunkumar Ganesan (VP – Mutual Fund) and Mahesh Tare (AVP – Mutual Fund)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory rule changes. This is an operational update to a previously announced NFO window, reflecting a revised end time communicated by the AMC.

## Compliance Requirements

- BSE members and distributors using the BSE StAR MF Platform must note the revised NFO closing time of **6:00 PM on February 25, 2026**
- Investors and intermediaries must ensure NFO subscription orders for ADITYA BIRLA SUN LIFE BSE TOP 10 BANKS ETF are submitted before the revised deadline

## Important Dates

- **February 20, 2026**: Original NFO launch notice issued (Notice No. 20260220-46)
- **February 25, 2026, 6:00 PM**: Revised NFO subscription window close time for ADITYA BIRLA SUN LIFE BSE TOP 10 BANKS ETF

## Impact Assessment

This update is operationally significant for investors and distributors who may have planned to submit NFO subscription orders later in the evening on February 25, 2026. The earlier-than-expected closure (6:00 PM vs. midnight) reduces the available subscription window on the final day. Members using the BSE StAR MF Platform should communicate this change to investors promptly to avoid missed subscriptions.
