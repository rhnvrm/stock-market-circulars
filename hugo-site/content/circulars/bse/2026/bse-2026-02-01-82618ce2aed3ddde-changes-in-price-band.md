## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The price band revisions will restrict intraday price movements for 9 securities, with Shantai Industries and Simandhar Impex facing the most restrictive 2% bands. This indicates heightened surveillance concerns for these scrips.

**Trading Impact**: Traders and investors in these securities will face tighter price movement limits, potentially affecting liquidity and trading strategies. The 2% band on two securities suggests significant volatility or surveillance concerns requiring strict controls.
