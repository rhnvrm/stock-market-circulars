---

## Summary

BSE has notified trading members of scrip name updates for three ETFs of HDFC Mutual Fund. The changes are purely cosmetic/administrative, shortening the existing names, and will be reflected in the BSE system effective February 27, 2026. All other details of the ETFs remain unchanged.

## Key Points

- Three HDFC Mutual Fund ETFs are having their scrip names updated on BSE.
- The changes are initiated based on instructions from HDFC Asset Management Company Limited.
- Only the display/scrip names are changing; scrip codes, ISINs, and symbols remain the same.
- The updates will be effective in the BSE system from February 27, 2026.

## Scrip Name Changes

| Scrip Code | ISIN | Symbol | Existing Name | Updated Name |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 533230 | INF179KC1981 | HDFCGOLD | HDFC Gold Exchange Traded Fund | HDFC Gold ETF |
| 539517 | INF179KC1HX2 | HDFCSENSEX | HDFC S&P BSE SENSEX ETF | HDFC BSE SENSEX ETF |
| 543774 | INF179KC1EZ4 | HDFCBSE500 | HDFC S&P BSE 500 ETF | HDFC BSE 500 ETF |

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an administrative update to scrip names carried out at the instruction of HDFC Asset Management Company Limited.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members should take note of the updated scrip names for the three ETFs and update any internal systems or references accordingly. No active compliance action is required beyond awareness of the name changes.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Effective Date of Name Change in BSE System:** February 27, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Impact is minimal. The changes are limited to shortening/simplifying the scrip display names of three HDFC ETFs. Scrip codes, ISINs, and trading symbols are unaffected, so trading operations, order management systems, and fund tracking will experience no material disruption. Investors and trading members may notice the updated names in BSE data feeds starting February 27, 2026.
