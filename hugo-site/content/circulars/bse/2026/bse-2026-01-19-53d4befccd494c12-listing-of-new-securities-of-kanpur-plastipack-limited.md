## Impact Assessment

Minimal immediate market impact as the preferential allotment is to promoters and all shares are locked in for approximately 18 months. The shares rank equally with existing equity shares but will not be tradeable until the lock-in period expires. This represents capital raising by the company through promoter participation at a significant premium to face value.
