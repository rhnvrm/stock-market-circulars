title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - February 2026 Update
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective February 04, 2026. One new security (Acceleratebs India Ltd) has been added to ESM Stage I, while six existing securities are being moved to higher ESM stages due to continued surveillance concerns. No securities are exiting the ESM framework or moving to lower stages in this update.

## Key Points

- 1 new security added to ESM Stage I: Acceleratebs India Ltd (Scrip Code: 543938, ISIN: INE0POP01017)
- 6 securities moving to higher ESM stages:
  - Arunis Abode Ltd (526935)
  - Chambal Breweries & Distilleries Ltd (512301)
  - Crimson Metal Engineering Company Ltd (526977)
  - Cura Technologies Ltd (532332)
  - Hiliks Technologies Ltd (539697)
  - Ramgopal Polytex Ltd (514223)
- No securities exiting ESM framework
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages
- Consolidated list includes 26+ securities across various ESM stages

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework continues to apply enhanced monitoring and trading restrictions on securities that exhibit abnormal price movements, volatility, or other market integrity concerns. Securities in higher ESM stages face stricter surveillance measures including potential additional disclosure requirements and trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ESM framework requirements for all listed securities
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in ESM securities
- Investors should be aware of the surveillance status when trading these securities
- Securities may face progressive restrictions based on ESM stage level

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 04, 2026 - All ESM changes come into effect

## Impact Assessment

The addition and escalation of securities under ESM framework will result in:
- Increased monitoring and potential trading restrictions for affected securities
- Possible impact on liquidity for the 7 securities (1 new entry + 6 escalations)
- Enhanced investor protection through stricter oversight
- Stage escalation indicates continued concerns about price behavior or market integrity
- Trade-for-trade settlement may apply to some securities in higher ESM stages
- Market participants should exercise caution when dealing in ESM securities

The absence of any securities moving to lower stages or exiting the framework suggests sustained surveillance concerns across the monitored universe.
