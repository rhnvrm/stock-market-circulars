## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact. This is a company-specific listing of preferential shares representing capital raised through warrant conversion. The lock-in period until July 15, 2026, means these shares cannot be traded freely for over six months, minimizing immediate dilution impact. Existing shareholders should note the capital structure change and potential future supply when lock-in expires.
