## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is a mock trading session on a non-trading day (Saturday). The session provides a critical testing opportunity for:

1. **System Readiness**: Members can test new BOLT Pro TWS version 12.50 before live deployment
2. **Business Continuity**: Testing of BSE-NSE interoperability ensures preparedness for actual outage scenarios
3. **Operational Resilience**: Validation of exceptional market conditions handling (trading halts, risk-reduction mode, etc.)
4. **Third-Party Integration**: Vendors and in-house developers can validate their trading applications

No impact on live trading or settlement activities. Testing enhances overall market infrastructure robustness and disaster recovery capabilities.
