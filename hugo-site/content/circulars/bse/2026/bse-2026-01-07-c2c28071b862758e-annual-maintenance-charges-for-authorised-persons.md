Trading members will be charged Rs 4,000 per Authorised Person registered as on March 31, 2026, applicable for Financial Year 2026-27, effective from April 1, 2026. This charge applies irrespective of the number of segments in which the AP is registered and is non-refundable once levied, even if AP registration is cancelled during the year.

## Key Points

- Charges applicable irrespective of number of segments in which AP is registered
- AMC is non-refundable once charged, even if AP registration is cancelled during the year for any reason including disciplinary action
- This is a continuation of the policy introduced via notice no. 20230727-31 dated July 27, 2023
- Charges will be imposed effective April 1, 2026 for Financial Year 2026-27

## Important Dates

- **March 31, 2026**: Cut-off date for determining registered APs subject to AMC
- **April 1, 2026**: Effective date for levy of Annual Maintenance Charges for FY 2026-27

## Impact Assessment

**Financial Impact**: Trading members with registered Authorised Persons will incur Rs 4,000 per AP annually. The total financial impact depends on the number of APs each member maintains.

**Operational Impact**: Low - This is a routine administrative charge that members should already be aware of from previous years. Members may review their AP registrations before March 31, 2026 to manage costs.

**Market Impact**: Minimal - This is an internal membership fee that does not affect trading operations or market participants beyond trading members.
