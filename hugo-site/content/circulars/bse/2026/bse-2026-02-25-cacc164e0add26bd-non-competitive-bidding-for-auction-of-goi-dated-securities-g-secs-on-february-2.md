## Impact Assessment

This circular has a **medium** operational impact limited to trading members and direct investors participating in the debt segment. The auction involves a re-issue of **6.48% GS 2035** with a large issue size of ₹32,000 Crore, which is significant for the government debt market. However, the non-competitive bidding window is narrow (especially for direct investors), and participants must act promptly. No systemic risk or broad market disruption is anticipated; this is a routine debt auction facilitation notice.
