## Compliance Requirements

- Investors holding securities in LT-ASM must be aware of enhanced surveillance conditions
- Securities in LT-ASM may face price bands, trade-to-trade settlement, and additional margin requirements
- Market participants should review holdings in affected securities and understand applicable ASM stage restrictions
- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable surveillance framework requirements for these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** January 27, 2026 - All LT-ASM framework changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 22 securities with varied impacts. New additions to LT-ASM will face enhanced surveillance and trading restrictions, potentially reducing liquidity. Securities moving to lower stages will see relaxed restrictions, potentially improving trading activity.

**Investor Impact:** Investors in newly added securities should expect increased volatility monitoring, potential price bands, and trade-to-trade settlement. Those holding securities moving to lower stages may benefit from reduced restrictions. Securities exiting to Trade for Trade framework will face stricter settlement conditions.

**Liquidity Impact:** New LT-ASM additions typically experience reduced liquidity due to enhanced surveillance measures. Securities exiting or moving to lower stages may see improved liquidity conditions.
