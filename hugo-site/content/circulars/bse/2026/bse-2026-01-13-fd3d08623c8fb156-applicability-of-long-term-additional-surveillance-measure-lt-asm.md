## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework continues to operate as a surveillance mechanism to identify and monitor securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or trading patterns over an extended period. Securities under this framework are subject to enhanced surveillance and may have trading restrictions including:

- Applicable margin requirements
- Price bands or circuit filters
- Trade-for-trade settlement basis
- Enhanced reporting requirements

The framework operates in multiple stages with progressively stricter surveillance measures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable margins and trading restrictions for securities under LT-ASM
- Enhanced due diligence required for client orders in these securities
- Adherence to trade-for-trade settlement requirements where applicable
- Monitoring of client trading activity in affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** January 14, 2026 - All changes to LT-ASM Framework take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The addition of 8 securities to the LT-ASM Framework will result in enhanced surveillance and potentially restricted trading conditions for these stocks. Investors and traders should expect:

- Increased margin requirements for positions in affected securities
- Possible reduction in liquidity due to surveillance measures
- Greater scrutiny of trading activity

**Trading Impact:** Securities moving out of LT-ASM to ESM Framework (3 securities) will continue to face surveillance measures under a different framework, maintaining regulatory oversight while potentially changing specific trading conditions.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of the enhanced surveillance status and adjust their trading strategies accordingly, considering potential liquidity constraints and margin requirements.
