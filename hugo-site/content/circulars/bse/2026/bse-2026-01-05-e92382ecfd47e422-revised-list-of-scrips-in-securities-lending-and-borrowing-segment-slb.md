## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The SLB segment facilitates price discovery, improves market liquidity, and enables risk management strategies. The inclusion of blue-chip stocks provides institutional investors with opportunities for generating additional returns through lending and allows short-sellers to borrow securities.

**Operational Impact:** Low - This is a routine administrative update that does not materially change market operations. Participants already familiar with SLB mechanisms simply need to note the current list of eligible securities.

**Investor Impact:** Medium - Retail investors are generally not affected as SLB is primarily used by institutional investors. However, the segment indirectly benefits all investors by improving market efficiency and liquidity in the listed securities.
