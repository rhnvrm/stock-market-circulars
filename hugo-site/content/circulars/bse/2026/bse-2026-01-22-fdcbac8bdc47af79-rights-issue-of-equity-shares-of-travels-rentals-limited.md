**Market Impact**: The ex-rights trading from January 28, 2026 will likely result in share price adjustment to reflect the rights value. Trading volumes may increase as shareholders and arbitrageurs adjust positions.

**Company Impact**: The rights issue enables capital raising for the company, with full payment required upfront ensuring committed capital infusion. The 1:1 ratio represents significant equity expansion if fully subscribed.
