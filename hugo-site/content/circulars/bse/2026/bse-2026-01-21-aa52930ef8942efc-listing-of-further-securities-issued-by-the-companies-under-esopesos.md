## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative listing with minimal market impact. The listing affects a small number of shares issued under employee benefit schemes. Only 1,539 shares (48%) are subject to lock-in restrictions, which prevents immediate trading and dilution concerns. The staggered lock-in expiry dates ensure gradual market supply, reducing potential volatility.
