## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects only holders and traders of these three specific PTCs issued by securitisation trusts.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members dealing in these debt instruments must update their trading systems to reflect the new face values. The partial redemption reduces the outstanding face value of each PTC, which will affect pricing calculations and settlement amounts.

**Investor Impact**: PTC holders have received partial redemption proceeds, reducing their exposure to these instruments. The remaining PTCs will trade at significantly reduced face values, which must be considered in valuation and portfolio management.
