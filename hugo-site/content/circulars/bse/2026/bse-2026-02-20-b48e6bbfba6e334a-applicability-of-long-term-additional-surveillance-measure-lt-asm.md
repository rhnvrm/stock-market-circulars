## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers and members must apply enhanced surveillance conditions (trade-for-trade settlement, higher margin requirements) for all securities newly placed under LT-ASM from February 23, 2026
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect stage changes for the 6 securities moving to lower ASM stages
- Normal trading conditions may be restored for the 9 securities exiting the LT-ASM framework, subject to any other applicable frameworks
- Securities exiting LT-ASM due to inclusion in Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, or IBC frameworks remain subject to those respective frameworks

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 20, 2026
- **Effective Date for all changes:** February 23, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Investors and traders holding positions in the 9 newly added LT-ASM securities will face increased margin requirements and trade-for-trade settlement restrictions from February 23, 2026, reducing liquidity and potentially impacting prices. The 6 securities moving to lower ASM stages will see relaxed surveillance conditions, which may improve trading liquidity for those scrips. The 9 securities exiting LT-ASM entirely will return to standard surveillance or alternative frameworks, potentially attracting broader market participation. Overall, this circular reflects routine periodic review of the LT-ASM list with balanced additions and removals.
