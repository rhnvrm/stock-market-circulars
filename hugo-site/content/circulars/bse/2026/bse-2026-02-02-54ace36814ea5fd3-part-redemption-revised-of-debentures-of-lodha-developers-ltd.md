title: Part Redemption (Revised) of Debentures of Lodha Developers Ltd
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a revised notice regarding the part redemption of debentures of Lodha Developers Ltd. This circular updates the earlier notice dated January 8, 2025, and provides the actual reduced face values for three debenture series. The revised face values will be applicable from February 3, 2026.

## Key Points

- Revision to earlier notice No. 20260108-22 dated January 8, 2025
- Three debenture scrips affected: 976923, 976764, and 977293
- Scrip 976923 (LDL-Reset Rate-21-01-28-PVT, INE670K07307): Reduced face value of Rs. 87,627 per debenture
- Scrip 977293 (LDL-TBILLS-13-11-28-PVT, INE670K07349): Reduced face value of Rs. 95,795 per debenture
- Scrip 976764 (LDL-8.14%-5-6-28-PVT, INE670K07281): Reduced face value of Rs. 80,000 per debenture
- All three are privately placed debentures

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action notification updating previously communicated face value reductions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised reduced face values for the three debenture scrips
- Trading members should ensure systems reflect the correct reduced face values from the effective date
- All trades in these debentures must be executed using the new reduced face values from February 3, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 2, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 3, 2026 - Debentures will trade with revised reduced face values from this date
- **Reference to Previous Notice**: January 8, 2025 (Notice No. 20260108-22)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders and traders of the three specific debenture series of Lodha Developers Ltd. The part redemption reduces the outstanding face value of these debt securities.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the correct reduced face values. The revision from the earlier notice suggests there was a recalculation of the redemption amounts, which may affect valuation and settlement processes for these instruments.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will see a reduction in the face value of their holdings corresponding to the part redemption amounts. This typically involves a cash payout for the redeemed portion, though payment details are not specified in this circular.
