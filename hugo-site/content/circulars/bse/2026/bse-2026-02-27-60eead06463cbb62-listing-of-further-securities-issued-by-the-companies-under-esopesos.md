## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular is an administrative notification under BSE's standard procedure for listing newly issued ESOP/ESOS shares once companies complete their allotment process.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants are requested to take note of the newly listed securities and their distribution numbers
- Brokers and depository participants should update their systems to reflect the new ISIN-wise share distribution ranges effective March 2, 2026
- No specific compliance action required from investors; shares will be available for trading from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 27, 2026
- **Effective Trading Date:** Monday, March 2, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry:** Not applicable (NA for all 11 companies)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine ESOP/ESOS listing circular with low market impact. The newly listed shares represent employee compensation conversions and are generally modest in quantity relative to each company's total outstanding equity. Lenskart Solutions Limited has the largest issuance at 15,45,820 shares, while Ideaforge Technology Limited has the smallest at 7,026 shares. Since no lock-in applies, these shares are immediately tradable from March 2, 2026, which may introduce minor incremental supply-side liquidity for the affected stocks. No significant price or volatility impact is anticipated.
