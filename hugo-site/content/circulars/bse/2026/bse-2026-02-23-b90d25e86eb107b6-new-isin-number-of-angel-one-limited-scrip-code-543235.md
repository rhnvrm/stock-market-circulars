## Impact Assessment

The share sub-division increases the number of shares outstanding while proportionally reducing the face value, making shares more accessible to retail investors. Trading members and custodians must ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN (INE732I01021) before February 26, 2026 to avoid settlement failures. The change is routine and does not affect the company's market capitalisation or fundamental value.
