title: Adjustment of Futures and Options contracts in BPCL for Interim Dividend
---

## Summary

BSE will adjust all Futures and Options contracts for Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) on February 01, 2026, due to the company's interim dividend payment of Rs. 10.00 per equity share. The adjustments will be effective from the ex-date of February 02, 2026, affecting all available F&O contracts in the Equity Derivative Segment.

## Key Points

- BPCL (Scrip Code: 500547) has declared interim dividend of Rs. 10.00 per equity share for FY 2025-26
- Record Date for dividend: February 02, 2026
- Ex-date for dividend: February 02, 2026
- Adjustments will be processed on February 01, 2026 (Sunday)
- All Options strike prices will be reduced by Rs. 10.00
- Futures contracts will be adjusted using reference rate minus Rs. 10.00
- Adjustments made in accordance with SEBI Master Circular SEBI/HO/MRD/DP/CIR/P/2016/135 dated December 16, 2016

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action adjustment as per existing SEBI guidelines and BSE notice 20180710-26 regarding review of adjustment of corporate actions for stock options.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of adjusted strike prices and futures base rates effective February 02, 2026
- Members should contact their respective relationship managers for further clarification
- All positions and orders must reflect the adjusted prices from the ex-date onwards

## Important Dates

- **January 28, 2026**: Notice issued
- **February 01, 2026**: Adjustment processing date (Sunday)
- **February 02, 2026**: Ex-date - adjusted prices applicable for trading
- **February 02, 2026**: Record Date for dividend eligibility

## Impact Assessment

**Options Contracts**: All existing strike prices will be reduced by Rs. 10.00 to account for the dividend payout. This means a strike price of Rs. 300 will become Rs. 290, maintaining the intrinsic value of options positions relative to the underlying stock price adjustment.

**Futures Contracts**: The adjusted futures price will be calculated as the mark-to-market settlement price on February 01, 2026 minus Rs. 10.00. This adjusted rate becomes the base/previous close for trading on February 02, 2026, ensuring continuity in futures pricing.

**Market Impact**: Moderate impact on BPCL derivatives traders who must account for the Rs. 10.00 adjustment in their strategies and risk management. Standard dividend adjustment procedure minimizes market disruption.
