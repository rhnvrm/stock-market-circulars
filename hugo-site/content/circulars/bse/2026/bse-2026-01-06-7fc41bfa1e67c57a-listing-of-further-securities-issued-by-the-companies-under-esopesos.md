## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The total number of shares being listed (343,734 shares) represents a small fraction of the existing float for these companies. Restaurant Brands Asia Limited accounts for the largest portion with 296,835 shares, while InterGlobe Aviation has the smallest at 500 shares.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in available float for trading. The shares are being listed as part of employee compensation schemes and may not immediately come to market.

**Dilution Impact**: Minor dilution for existing shareholders, as ESOP/ESOS issuances are typically planned and disclosed in advance as part of company compensation policies.

**Trading Impact**: No special trading restrictions or surveillance measures applied. Normal trading rules apply from the listing date.
