The circular modifies the cut-off dates for reporting corresponding to specific trade dates to accommodate the exceptional trading day.

## Key Points

- Special live trading session scheduled on Sunday, February 1, 2026 for Union Budget presentation
- Modified reporting schedule for client collateral segregation applies to clearing members
- Reports for trade dates January 30, 31, and February 1, 2026 will have cut-off date of February 2, 2026
- Non-submission of client collateral segregation reporting will be treated as non-compliance
- Penalties for non-submission will be applicable as per existing circular provisions
