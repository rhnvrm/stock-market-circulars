## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will impact trading activity in these 20 securities by limiting intraday price movements. Tighter bands (2%-5%) indicate heightened surveillance and will restrict volatility significantly, potentially reducing liquidity but protecting against excessive speculation. Securities with wider bands (10%-20%) have relatively more trading flexibility. Market participants should adjust their trading strategies accordingly and be aware of the increased surveillance measures on these scrips.
