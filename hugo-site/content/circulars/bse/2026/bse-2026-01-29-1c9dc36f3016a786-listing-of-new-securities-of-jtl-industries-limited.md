## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing adds 11.04 million shares to JTL Industries' tradable equity base, representing a significant increase in share capital. However, the immediate market impact is limited due to the lock-in period until July 31, 2026.

**Liquidity Impact**: Current liquidity impact is minimal as all newly listed shares are locked-in for approximately 6 months. Post lock-in expiry, there could be increased supply in the market which may create downward pressure on share price.

**Dilution Impact**: Existing shareholders will experience dilution from this preferential allotment. The extent depends on the company's pre-issue share capital.

**Investment Consideration**: The Rs. 300 issue price provides a reference point for valuation. Investors should monitor post-July 2026 for potential selling pressure when lock-in expires.
