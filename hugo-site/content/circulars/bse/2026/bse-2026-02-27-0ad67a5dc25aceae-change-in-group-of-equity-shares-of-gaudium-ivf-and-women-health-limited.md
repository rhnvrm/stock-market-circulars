## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that the equity shares of Gaudium IVF and Women Health Limited (Scrip Code: 544709) will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (T Group) to the Rolling segment (B Group) with effect from Monday, March 16, 2026. This notice is issued in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 0260226-41 dated February 26, 2026.

## Key Points

- Scrip Code: 544709 (Gaudium IVF and Women Health Limited)
- Current segment: Trade for Trade (T Group)
- New segment: Rolling settlement (B Group)
- Effective date: Monday, March 16, 2026
- Contact person: Mr. Parag Jain, Tel. No. 022 2272 8685
- Issued by: Hardik Bhuta, Assistant Vice President, BSE

## Regulatory Changes

The stock will move from compulsory delivery-based Trade for Trade (T Group) settlement to normal Rolling segment (B Group) settlement. Under T Group, every trade results in mandatory delivery and intraday squaring-off is not permitted. Under B Group (Rolling segment), standard T+1 rolling settlement applies and intraday trading is permitted.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems and client advisories to reflect the segment change effective March 16, 2026.
- Members with open positions or pending deliveries in the T Group should ensure settlement is completed before the transition date.
- For queries, trading members may contact Mr. Parag Jain at 022 2272 8685.

## Important Dates

- **February 26, 2026**: Original Exchange Notice No. 0260226-41 issued
- **February 27, 2026**: This continuation notice issued
- **March 16, 2026 (Monday)**: Effective date of transfer from T Group to B Group

## Impact Assessment

This transition is a routine post-IPO measure indicating that the exchange is satisfied with price discovery in the initial trading phase under the stricter T Group framework. The move to B Group (Rolling segment) will:
- Enable intraday trading in GAUDIUMIVF shares
- Increase liquidity as a broader set of traders can participate
- Subject the stock to standard T+1 rolling settlement rules
- Potentially increase trading volumes due to reduced settlement restrictions

The impact is moderate for existing shareholders and traders in this scrip. No action is required from investors; the change is operational and will be implemented automatically by the exchange on the effective date.
