## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market impact as it pertains to routine SDL auction procedures. It primarily affects:

- **Debt market participants**: Trading members and institutional investors interested in state government securities
- **State governments**: Facilitates borrowing for Assam, J&K, Karnataka, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and Uttarakhand
- **Liquidity**: Adds Rs. 13,000 crores to the SDL market

The non-competitive bidding facility allows retail and smaller institutional investors to participate in government securities auctions without competing with large institutional bidders, promoting broader market participation.
