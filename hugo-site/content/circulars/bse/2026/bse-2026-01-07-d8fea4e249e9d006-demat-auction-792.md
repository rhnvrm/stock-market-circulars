## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - The auction involves 88 different securities including several large-cap stocks, indicating widespread settlement failures. This can create price volatility in affected stocks during auction hours.

**Member Impact:** High - Trading members with delivery obligations face mandatory auction participation with potential financial penalties. Failed deliveries result in auction buying at potentially unfavorable prices plus penalty charges.

**Investor Impact:** Medium - Investors may experience temporary liquidity issues or price fluctuations in the listed securities. The large quantity in some scrips (especially MIRC ELECTRO with 114,296 shares) could cause significant price movements.

**Operational Impact:** Standard auction procedures apply, but the wide range of securities requires coordinated settlement operations across multiple market segments.
