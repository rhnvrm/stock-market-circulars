## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to permit trading of the new securities from February 26, 2026 onwards.
- All 28,72,340 shares are subject to a **lock-in** and cannot be traded by the promoter allottees until the lock-in period expires.

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds approximately 28.72 lakh shares to Jupiter Wagons Limited's tradeable equity base. However, since the entire allotment is locked in until September 2, 2027, there is no immediate increase in free-float or selling pressure from promoters. The preferential allotment at Rs. 470/- per share reflects the conversion price of the warrants previously issued to promoters, which may be compared against the current market price to assess dilution impact. Overall market impact is moderate and routine.
