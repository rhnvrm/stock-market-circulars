## Summary

The revised ex-date applies to securities with record date of January 15, 2026 for purposes including redemption of commercial paper (CP) and non-convertible debentures (NCD), and payment of interest. All affected securities will now have ex-date of January 14, 2026 with revised ex-settlement number DR-798/2025-2026.
