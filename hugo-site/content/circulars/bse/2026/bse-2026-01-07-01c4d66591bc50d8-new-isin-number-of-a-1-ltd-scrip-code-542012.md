## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Neutral to positive. Share sub-division typically improves liquidity by making shares more affordable to retail investors. The price per share will adjust proportionally (1:10 ratio).

**Operational Impact:** Medium. Trading members and market infrastructure providers need to update systems with the new ISIN. Shareholders will see their holdings multiplied by 10 with proportionate price adjustment. No impact on total investment value.
