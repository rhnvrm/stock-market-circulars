## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium for SLB participants only. Members engaging in securities lending and borrowing must plan their operations according to the published schedule. The staggered timings on January 16 require attention to avoid submission delays.

**Participants Affected**: Stock brokers, institutional investors, and clearing members participating in the SLB segment. Regular equity market participants are not affected.

**Business Continuity**: The schedule ensures uninterrupted SLB operations throughout January 2026 with appropriate adjustments for holidays.
