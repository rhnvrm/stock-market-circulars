---

## Summary

BSE has notified trading members about the suspension of trading in Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of Hinduja Leyland Finance Limited effective January 12, 2026. The suspension is necessitated by the company's scheduled redemption of debentures and interest payment, with the record date set for January 12, 2026. Trading members are explicitly advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Trading in HLFL debentures (ISIN: INE146O07482, Code: 974568) to be suspended from January 12, 2026
- Suspension applies to HLFL-GSEC-26-1-26-PVT series debentures
- Record date fixed as January 12, 2026 for redemption and interest payment purposes
- No dealings permitted from the suspension date onwards
- Notice issued under reference number DR-796/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational notification for debenture redemption procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealings in the specified HLFL debentures from January 12, 2026
- Trading members should ensure their systems and operations reflect the trading suspension
- Members must not accept or execute any orders for the specified debenture series post the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **January 1, 2026**: Circular issued
- **January 12, 2026**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **January 12, 2026**: Trading suspension effective date (no dealings from this date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of specific HLFL debenture series. The suspension is temporary and procedural in nature, related to the scheduled maturity/redemption of the instrument.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their trading systems to prevent transactions in the suspended debenture. Debenture holders will receive their redemption proceeds and final interest payment as per the company's schedule.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders on record as of January 12, 2026 will be eligible for redemption proceeds and interest payment. Secondary market liquidity ceases from the suspension date, which is standard practice for maturing debt instruments.
