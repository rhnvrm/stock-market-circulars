The shares are subject to lock-in until August 31, 2026.

- Distinct numbers: 18463001 to 19353000
- Date of allotment: September 24, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members should note:
- The new shares are available for trading from February 6, 2026
- All 8,90,000 shares are subject to lock-in restrictions
- Shares cannot be transferred until lock-in expiry

- **Trading Start Date**: February 6, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This represents a routine preferential allotment by a small-cap company. The 8.9 lakh shares increase the company's equity base marginally.

**Trading Impact**: The shares are locked-in for approximately 6 months, preventing immediate trading by allottees. No immediate liquidity impact expected.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution from this preferential issue, though the shares were allotted in September 2025.
