## Impact Assessment

Securities under ST-ASM framework face enhanced surveillance measures which typically include:
- Reduced price bands
- 100% upfront margin requirements
- Trade-to-trade settlement
- Increased monitoring of price and volume movements
- Potential additional restrictions on trading

For securities entering ST-ASM, investors should expect reduced liquidity and higher trading costs. Securities exiting the framework will see relaxation of these surveillance measures, potentially improving liquidity. The movement of Vivimed Labs to a lower stage indicates improved compliance or reduced concerns.
