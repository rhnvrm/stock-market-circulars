## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard operational circular for demat auction process.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants with outstanding delivery obligations for the listed scrips must participate in the demat auction
- Settlement must be completed as per BSE settlement cycle requirements
- Participants should ensure availability of securities or funds to fulfill auction obligations

## Important Dates

- Settlement Date: January 16, 2026 (Settlement No. 798)
- Auction participants must comply with standard BSE auction timelines and procedures

## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it relates to routine settlement operations. The impact is limited to:

- **Specific Market Participants**: Only affects those with pending delivery obligations in the listed scrips
- **Price Impact**: Demat auctions may cause temporary price movements in affected scrips, particularly those with larger quantities
- **Liquidity**: Minor and temporary impact on liquidity for the specific securities listed
- **Operational**: Standard settlement process ensuring smooth delivery vs payment mechanism

The auction quantities for most blue-chip stocks are relatively small and unlikely to cause significant market disruption. Higher volume auctions in smaller stocks (like Tilak Ventures, Wardwizard Innovations) may see more pronounced temporary effects.
