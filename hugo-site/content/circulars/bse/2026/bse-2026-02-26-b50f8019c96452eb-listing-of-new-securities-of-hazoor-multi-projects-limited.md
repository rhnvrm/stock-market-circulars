The shares were issued at Rs. 30/- each (face value Rs. 1/- at a premium of Rs. 29/-) to Non-Promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to conversion of warrants. These shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification for newly allotted securities under a preferential allotment approved by the company.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to permit trading of the newly listed securities from the effective date
- Lock-in restriction applies to all 10,00,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 233339911 to 234339910) until September 9, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** November 17, 2025
- **Trading Effective From:** February 27, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing of 10,00,000 new shares represents a relatively small preferential allotment for Hazoor Multi Projects Limited. The entire tranche is subject to a lock-in period until September 9, 2026, which limits immediate selling pressure on the secondary market. Broader market impact is minimal given the company's small-cap profile.
