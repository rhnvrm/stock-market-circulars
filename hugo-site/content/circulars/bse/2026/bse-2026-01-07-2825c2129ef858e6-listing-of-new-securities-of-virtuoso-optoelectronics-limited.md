## Summary

BSE has approved the listing of 5,86,081 new equity shares of Virtuoso Optoelectronics Limited (Scrip Code: 543597) with effect from Thursday, January 8, 2026. These shares were issued at a premium to Non-Promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to the conversion of warrants. The newly listed shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares and are subject to a lock-in period.

## Key Points

- Allotment basis: Preferential allotment to Non-Promoter pursuant to warrant conversion
- Date of allotment: November 7, 2025
- Trading commencement: January 8, 2026
- Scrip Code: 543597
- ISIN: INE0I0T01010

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification following the completion of preferential allotment procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members of BSE are informed that these new securities are listed and permitted for trading effective January 8, 2026. Members must update their systems to reflect the increased share capital of Virtuoso Optoelectronics Limited.

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment**: November 7, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: January 8, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry**: July 11, 2026 (for all 5,86,081 shares)

## Impact Assessment

This listing represents a capital raise through warrant conversion for Virtuoso Optoelectronics Limited. The preferential allotment to Non-Promoters increases the public float of the company. The lock-in period of approximately 6 months (until July 11, 2026) ensures these shares cannot be immediately traded, limiting short-term supply impact. The issue price of Rs. 455/- per share indicates investor confidence at the time of warrant allotment. This is a company-specific event with minimal broader market implications.
