## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a routine operational settlement notice under existing BSE settlement and auction framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members should reconcile their positions against the listed quantities

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine demat auction settlement notice. Impact is primarily on brokers and clearing members who have short delivery positions in the listed securities. End investors in the affected scrips may experience delayed or auction-based settlement for the specified quantities. Notable large-quantity auctions include NOVARTIS INDIA (4031 shares), Vistar Amar (4002 shares), BGIL FILMS (3602 shares), and MRC AGROTECH (3000 shares), which may see localized price impact. Major blue-chip stocks like RELIANCE, HDFC BANK, SBI, INFOSYS, and L&T appear with small quantities (1–228 shares), indicating isolated delivery failures rather than systemic issues.
