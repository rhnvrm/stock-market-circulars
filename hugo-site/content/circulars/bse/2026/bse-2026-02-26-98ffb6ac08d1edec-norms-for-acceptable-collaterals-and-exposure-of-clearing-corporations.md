## Impact Assessment

This circular has a moderate operational impact on clearing members, custodians, and PCMs. Entities that currently use banks not on this revised list for collateral purposes will need to transition to approved banks. The inclusion of AU Small Finance Bank and continuation of major public/private sector and foreign banks provides sufficient optionality for members. No market-wide trading or settlement disruptions are expected; the impact is primarily administrative for compliance and risk management teams.
