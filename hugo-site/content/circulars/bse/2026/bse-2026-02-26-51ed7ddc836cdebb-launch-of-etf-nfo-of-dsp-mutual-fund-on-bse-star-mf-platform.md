## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market-wide impact. It is operationally relevant to BSE members and distributors participating in mutual fund transactions via the BSE StAR MF platform. Investors seeking exposure to the top 10 banking sector stocks through a passive ETF structure may find this NFO of interest. The banking sector focus means performance will be correlated with the financial sector's performance on the BSE index.
