## Impact Assessment

**High Impact for Debenture Holders**: The reduction of corporate guarantee from 100% to 20% of debt significantly reduces the security cushion for debenture holders. While the primary security (charge over assets) and personal guarantee remain intact, the corporate guarantee provided an additional layer of protection that has been substantially diminished. This modification increases credit risk for investors holding these debentures, though it has been approved by the debenture holders themselves.
