---

## Summary

BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) has published the Demat Auction list for Settlement No. 826 dated 24 February 2026. The auction covers securities where delivery obligations were not met by members, requiring BSE to conduct a compulsory auction to fulfil outstanding settlement obligations.

## Key Points

- Settlement No. 826 demat auction conducted on 24/02/2026
- Over 75 scrips across diverse sectors are listed for auction
- Quantities range from 1 share (e.g., Allied Blend, DCW Ltd, Force Motors) to over 25,000 shares (e.g., DEE Developments: 25,638; Blue Jet Healthcare: 10,686; Gujarat Tools: 13,598)
- Both large-cap and small/mid-cap companies are included
- Notable scrips include Axis Bank (8 shares), AU Small Finance Bank (5 shares), Sun Pharma (100 shares), Tata Motors (15 shares), Punjab National Bank (100 shares), Suzlon Energy (7 shares), and Ola Electric (900 shares)
- Three separate NIPPON INDIA entries appear (scrip codes 542747, 590095, 590096) with quantities 77, 25, and 2 respectively

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational notice under BSE's existing settlement and auction framework for handling delivery failures in normal market settlements.

## Compliance Requirements

- BSE members who have delivery shortfalls in the listed securities for Settlement No. 826 are subject to compulsory auction
- Members must settle obligations as per BSE auction settlement procedures
- Buying members with unmatched deliveries will receive auction payouts as per BSE settlement rules
- No action required by retail investors unless they are direct counterparties to the listed settlement shortfalls

## Important Dates

- **Auction Date:** 24 February 2026
- **Settlement Number:** 826

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine demat auction circular with low systemic significance. The quantities involved for most scrips are small (1–500 shares), indicating minor delivery failures. A few scrips have larger quantities:

- **DEE Developments:** 25,638 shares
- **Gujarat Tools:** 13,598 shares
- **Blue Jet Healthcare:** 10,686 shares
- **R M Drip and Sprinklers:** 5,136 shares
- **Ola Electric:** 900 shares

The auction may cause minor temporary price pressure on the specific scrips listed. Large-cap stocks like Axis Bank, Sun Pharma, and Tata Motors appear with very small quantities (5–100 shares), minimising any material price impact. The circular is primarily relevant to BSE trading members involved in the affected settlements.
