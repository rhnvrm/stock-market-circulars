## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. This is a routine preferential allotment listing for ERAAYA LIFESPACES LIMITED. The shares are locked-in until July 30, 2027, preventing immediate trading by allottees.

**Company Impact:** The preferential allotment increases the total equity capital of the company by 42,00,000 shares. The company has raised Rs. 3.40 crores (approximately) through this issuance at Rs. 81/- per share.

**Trading Impact:** The new shares will be available for trading from January 28, 2026, though the specific allotted shares remain locked-in. The increased share capital may have minor dilution effects on existing non-promoter shareholders.
