## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective January 21, 2026. Four securities are being newly shortlisted under ST-ASM Stage I framework, while eight securities are moving out of the framework. No securities are moving to higher or lower stages within the framework.

## Key Points

- 4 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework at Stage I
- 8 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework
- Changes effective from January 21, 2026
- One security moving out due to inclusion in LT-ASM Framework (AuSom Enterprise Ltd)
- Framework includes provisions for SME scrips and T+0 scrips

## Securities Added to ST-ASM Stage I

1. **Chandra Prabhu International Ltd** (530309, INE368D01025)
2. **Hindustan Tin Works Ltd** (530315, INE428D01019)
3. **IFCI Limited** (500106, INE039A01010) - As per NSE
4. **Riddhi Siddhi Gluco Biols Ltd** (524480, INE249D01019)

## Regulatory Changes

Securities under ST-ASM framework are subject to enhanced surveillance measures including trading restrictions and special monitoring. The framework operates in stages (5/15/30 Days) with varying levels of surveillance intensity. Securities can move between stages or to other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM, GSM, Trade for Trade, Pledge Framework) based on market behavior.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised surveillance status of affected securities
- Trading in newly added securities will be subject to ST-ASM Stage I restrictions
- Brokers and investors should adjust their risk management systems accordingly
- Securities moving out of ST-ASM may still be under other surveillance frameworks

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 21, 2026
- **Circular Date**: January 20, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 4 securities to ST-ASM Stage I will result in enhanced surveillance and potential trading restrictions for these stocks. Investors holding or trading these securities should expect increased monitoring and possible additional margin requirements. The removal of 8 securities from ST-ASM provides relief, though one security (AuSom Enterprise Ltd) is moving to the more stringent LT-ASM framework. Overall market impact is limited to specific securities and their investors.
