title: Revision in Eligibility Criteria for Direct Listing on BSE Main Board and SME
  Migration
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the eligibility criteria applicable to SME companies seeking migration to the Main Board and to companies listed on other recognized stock exchanges seeking direct listing on the BSE Main Board. The circular specifies minimum thresholds across paid-up capital, market capitalisation, market liquidity, operating profit, networth, net tangible assets, promoter holding, and lock-in requirements.

## Key Points

- Minimum paid-up capital of Rs. 10 crores required for both SME migration and direct listing applicants.
- Direct listing (from other exchanges to Main Board) requires an average 6-month market capitalisation of Rs. 1,000 crores; SME migration requires Rs. 100 crores — OR revenue from operations of Rs. 100 crores or more for each of the 3 immediately preceding full financial years.
- Market liquidity criteria require at least 5% of weighted average listed equity shares traded in the 6-month period, trading on at least 80% of trading days, minimum average daily turnover of Rs. 10 Lakhs (minimum Rs. 5 Lakhs on any day), and minimum average daily trades of 50 (minimum 25 on any day).
- Operating profit (EBITDA) must average Rs. 15 crores on a restated consolidated basis over the preceding 3 years, with a minimum of Rs. 10 crores in each individual year.
- Networth must be at least Rs. 1 crore in each of the preceding 3 full financial years (restated, consolidated basis).
- Net tangible assets must be at least Rs. 3 crores in each of the preceding 3 full years, with not more than 50% held in monetary assets (unless firm commitments to deploy excess monetary assets exist).
- Promoter holding must be at least 20% at the time of making application; promoter group shareholding may be included to meet any shortfall.
- Promoter and promoter group shares are subject to a 6-month lock-in from the date of listing on BSE.

## Regulatory Changes

- Revised eligibility framework consolidates criteria for both direct listing from other recognized exchanges and SME-to-Main-Board migration into a single table.
- Average daily turnover calculation methodology clarified: aggregate turnover on days the scrip traded divided by total number of trading days in the 6-month period.
- Exemptions introduced: minimum promoter holding requirement does not apply to companies with diversified holdings or no identifiable promoters already listed on a recognized exchange with nationwide trading terminals. Similarly, the lock-in criterion does not apply to such already-listed companies meeting all other eligibility criteria.
- Name-change provision: if a company changed its name within the last one year, at least 50% of revenue (restated, consolidated) for the preceding full year must be from the activity indicated by the new name.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies applying for direct listing or SME migration must demonstrate compliance with all financial thresholds (paid-up capital, market cap or revenue, EBITDA, networth, net tangible assets) on a restated and consolidated basis.
- Liquidity metrics must be met over a 6-month reference period unless the revenue-from-operations alternative criterion (Rs. 100 crores per year for 3 years) is satisfied.
- Promoters must hold at least 20% at application date; shares will be locked in for 6 months post-listing unless the exchange-nationwide-terminal exemption applies.
- Companies that changed names within the past year must provide evidence that at least 50% of revenue aligns with the new business activity.

## Important Dates

- Circular date: 23 February 2026.
- Lock-in period: 6 months from the date of listing on BSE (applicable to promoter and promoter group shares).
- Financial year reference periods: 3 preceding full financial years (12 months each) for EBITDA, networth, and net tangible asset calculations; 6-month period for market capitalisation and liquidity metrics.

## Impact Assessment

This circular has high impact on companies currently listed on regional or smaller recognized exchanges that aspire to cross-list or migrate to the BSE Main Board, as well as SME-listed companies planning to upgrade. The Rs. 1,000 crore market capitalisation bar for direct listing is a significant threshold that will restrict eligibility to well-established mid-to-large companies. The liquidity conditions (80% trading day coverage, minimum daily turnover, and trade count floors) add operational scrutiny beyond financial metrics. The clarified exemptions for companies with nationwide trading terminal listings and no identifiable promoters provide regulatory flexibility for professionally managed or widely-held entities. Overall, the revised framework tightens entry standards for Main Board listing while providing structured alternative pathways via revenue thresholds.
