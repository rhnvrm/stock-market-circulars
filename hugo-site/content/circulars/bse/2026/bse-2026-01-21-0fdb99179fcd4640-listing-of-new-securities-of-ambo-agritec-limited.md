## Summary

BSE has listed 15,00,000 new equity shares of AMBO AGRITEC LIMITED (Scrip Code: 543678) with effect from January 22, 2026. These shares were issued at Rs. 30 per share (face value Rs. 10 + premium Rs. 20) to promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to conversion of warrants. The shares are subject to lock-in until August 31, 2027 and rank pari-passu with existing equity shares.

## Key Points

- 15,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10 face value listed on BSE
- Issue price: Rs. 30 per share (including Rs. 20 premium)
- Allotment date: July 17, 2025
- Trading commencement: January 22, 2026
- Distinctive Numbers: 15483161 to 16983160
- ISIN: INE0N6V01016
- Issued to promoters on preferential basis through warrant conversion
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification under existing SEBI preferential allotment regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the listing of new securities for trading purposes
- Lock-in restrictions must be enforced by depositories and trading systems
- No trading permitted in locked-in shares until lock-in expiry

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date:** July 17, 2025
- **Trading Commencement:** January 22, 2026
- **Lock-in Period Expiry:** August 31, 2027

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The preferential allotment increases the equity base by 15 lakh shares, but the complete lock-in until August 2027 means these shares will not be available for trading for over 18 months. This prevents any immediate supply pressure on the stock.

**Company Impact:** Positive for AMBO AGRITEC LIMITED as the warrant conversion indicates successful capital raising from promoters, strengthening the company's financial position. The promoter commitment through warrant conversion also signals confidence in the company's prospects.

**Investor Impact:** Neutral to existing shareholders. While dilution occurs, the lock-in period and promoter participation suggest long-term commitment. Investors should note the expanded share capital for valuation purposes.
