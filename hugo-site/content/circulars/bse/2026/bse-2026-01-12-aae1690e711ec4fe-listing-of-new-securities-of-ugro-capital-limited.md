## Impact Assessment

The listing represents a significant equity dilution event for Ugro Capital Limited, with approximately 2.3 crore new shares entering the market. The conversion of CCDs to equity shares strengthens the company's equity base while reducing debt obligations. The lock-in period until June 30, 2026 provides temporary stability by preventing immediate selling pressure from allottees. Investors should note that the preferential allotment to Non-Promoters at Rs. 185 per share will impact the overall shareholding pattern and could affect stock price dynamics once the lock-in expires.
