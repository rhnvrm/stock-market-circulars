- Oversubscription Option: 2,64,59,185 units (2.78% of unit capital)
- Total potential offering: 7,00,90,556 units (7.36% if oversubscription exercised)

- Bidders and brokers must read the entire Notice along with OFS Guidelines before participating
- Transaction must comply with SEBI OFS Circular (December 30, 2024)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The potential sale of up to 7.36% stake by a major public unitholder (Government of Singapore) represents a significant secondary market transaction for IndiGrid Infrastructure Trust. The staggered offering across two days with separate windows for retail and institutional investors is designed to manage market impact and ensure orderly price discovery.

**Liquidity Impact**: The offering provides liquidity opportunity for both retail and institutional investors to acquire units in IndiGrid Infrastructure Trust through a transparent stock exchange mechanism.

**Ownership Impact**: Successful completion of the full offering would result in Government of Singapore reducing its holding by up to 7.36% of the InvIT's unit capital, potentially leading to broader ownership distribution.
