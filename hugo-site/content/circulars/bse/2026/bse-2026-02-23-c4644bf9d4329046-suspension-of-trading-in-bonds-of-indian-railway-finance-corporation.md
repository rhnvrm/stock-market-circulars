## Impact Assessment

This suspension affects holders and traders of two specific IRFC NCD series maturing on March 22, 2026 (as indicated by the bond nomenclature). The impact is limited to debt market participants holding or trading these specific ISINs. Both bonds carry coupon rates of 7.04% and 7.29% respectively. The suspension is a standard pre-redemption measure to ensure clean settlement; bondholders will receive redemption proceeds on or around the record date. No impact on IRFC equity or other listed securities.
