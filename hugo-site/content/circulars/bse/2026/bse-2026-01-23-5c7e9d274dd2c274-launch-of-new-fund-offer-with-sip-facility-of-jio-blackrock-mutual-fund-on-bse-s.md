## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine NFO launch for a new equity sector rotation fund scheme. It expands investment options for mutual fund investors on BSE StAR MF Platform but does not affect broader market operations or trading.

**Operational Impact**: Low to medium for BSE members dealing in mutual funds. Members must ensure compliance with fund collection timelines, payment processing, and client authentication requirements specific to this NFO. The extended hours for lumpsum purchases and specific cutoff times for SIP registrations require operational coordination.

**Investor Impact**: Provides new investment opportunity in sector rotation strategy through JIO BLACKROCK MUTUAL FUND for investors seeking equity exposure with tactical sector allocation.
