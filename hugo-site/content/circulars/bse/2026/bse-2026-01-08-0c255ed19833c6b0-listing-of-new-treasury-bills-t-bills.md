## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a standard operational circular informing trading members about new government securities available for trading. The addition of three T-Bills with varying maturities provides additional short-term debt investment options but represents routine market operations. No changes to trading rules or operational procedures beyond the standard T-2 trading suspension before maturity.
