## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework is introduced. This circular operationalises a scheme merger under SEBI's mutual fund regulations, updating ISIN mappings on the BSE StAR MF Platform from the transferor schemes to the corresponding transferee schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Distributors, registrars, and platforms transacting on BSE StAR MF must update their systems to map the six transferor ISINs to the respective transferee ISINs.
- Existing SIPs, STPs, or standing instructions linked to transferor scheme ISINs should be re-mapped to the transferee scheme ISINs as per the merger terms.

## Important Dates

- Circular date: 2026-02-24. Specific effective date of the merger is not mentioned in this circular; refer to the HSBC Mutual Fund scheme merger notice for exact cut-off and record dates.

## Impact Assessment

Existing investors in HSBC Global Equity Climate Change Fund of Fund will have their holdings transferred to the corresponding HSBC Global Emerging Markets Fund scheme. The fund mandate will shift from a climate-change-themed global equity fund-of-funds to a broader global emerging markets fund. Investors should review the change in investment objective and risk profile before or after the merger takes effect. Platforms and intermediaries using BSE StAR MF must ensure ISIN mappings are updated promptly to avoid failed transactions.
