## Regulatory Framework

The Short Term ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities experiencing unusual price movements or volatility. Securities under ST-ASM may have:
- Enhanced margin requirements
- Trade-to-trade settlement
- Price bands
- Reduced position limits

Securities can move out of ST-ASM if they are included in other frameworks such as LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge Framework, or ESM.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** January 22, 2026
- All changes to ST-ASM classifications become applicable from this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Investors in the 6 newly added securities will face stricter surveillance measures
- Enhanced margin requirements may reduce speculative activity
- Reduced liquidity expected for securities entering ST-ASM
- Two securities exiting the framework may see improved trading conditions

**Trading Impact:**
- Securities under ST-ASM typically have 100% margin requirements
- Trade-to-trade settlement basis (no intraday squaring off)
- Heightened scrutiny on price movements and volumes
- SME scrips included indicate broader market surveillance
