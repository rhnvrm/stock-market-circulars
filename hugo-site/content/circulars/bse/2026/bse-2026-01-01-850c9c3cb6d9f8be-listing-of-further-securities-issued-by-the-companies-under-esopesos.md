## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The number of shares being listed is relatively small for both companies, representing negligible dilution to existing shareholders. Dalmia Bharat's 792 shares and Rishabh Instruments' 6,019 shares will have no material impact on stock prices or market capitalization.

**Operational Impact**: Routine administrative update requiring no action from market participants beyond awareness. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares can be traded immediately, though the small volumes are unlikely to affect liquidity significantly.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders face minimal dilution. Employees receiving these options now have tradeable securities without restrictions, providing them with liquidity options.
