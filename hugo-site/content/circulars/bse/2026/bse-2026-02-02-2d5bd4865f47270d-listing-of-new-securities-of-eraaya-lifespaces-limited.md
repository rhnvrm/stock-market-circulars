## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action involving preferential allotment to promoters. The lock-in period until August 15, 2027 means these shares cannot be traded for approximately 18 months, limiting immediate market impact. The new shares rank pari-passu with existing shares, maintaining equal rights for all shareholders. The issuance represents capital raising through warrant conversion, which was likely pre-disclosed and expected by the market.
