## Lock-in Details

All 3,03,030 shares (Distinctive Numbers 194988433 to 195291462) are subject to lock-in until July 28, 2027, as per regulatory requirements for preferential allotments to promoters.

## Impact Assessment

The impact is minimal as this represents a routine preferential allotment to promoters following warrant conversion. The shares are locked-in until July 2027, preventing immediate trading by allottees. The quantity of shares (3.03 lakh) represents a relatively small addition to the existing share capital and will not affect near-term market liquidity or price discovery for Som Distilleries & Breweries Ltd.
