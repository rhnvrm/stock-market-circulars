## Summary

BSE has announced surveillance measures affecting 41 securities through trade-for-trade (T2T) segment placement. Effective January 22, 2026, 20 securities from the rolling segment (Group B and X) will be shifted to trade-for-trade segment (Group T and XT), and 1 SME security will move to Group MT. Additionally, 20 securities will be retained in the T2T segment with a 5% or lower price band. This measure restricts intraday trading and requires mandatory delivery-based transactions.

## Key Points

- 20 securities shifting from rolling segment to T2T segment (Groups T and XT) with 5% or lower price band
- 1 SME security (Novateor Research Laboratories Ltd) moving to Group MT
- 20 securities being retained in T2T segment with existing restrictions
- All changes effective from January 22, 2026
- Trade-for-trade segment prohibits intraday trading and requires delivery settlement
- Price band restriction of 5% or lower applies to all affected securities

## Regulatory Changes

The exchange is implementing enhanced surveillance measures by moving securities to trade-for-trade groups:

**New Inclusions (Rolling to T2T):**
- Group B to T: AAA Technologies Ltd, Avro India Ltd, S. M. Gold Ltd
- Group X to XT: 17 securities including Auto Pins (India) Ltd, Avi Products India Ltd, Filmcity Media Ltd, Garware Synthetics Ltd, and others
- Group M to MT: Novateor Research Laboratories Ltd (SME)

**Retained in T2T:**
- 20 securities including Arcee Industries Ltd, Caprolactam Chemicals Ltd, Manaksia Aluminium Company Ltd, and others remain in Groups T, XT, and P

## Compliance Requirements

- **Brokers and Trading Members:** Must ensure all trades in affected securities are executed on a delivery basis only from January 22, 2026
- **Investors:** Cannot square off positions intraday; all purchases must result in delivery and all sales must be from demat holdings
- **Market Participants:** Must comply with 5% or lower price band restrictions for all affected securities
- **Systems and Risk Management:** Trading systems must be updated to reflect T2T segment classification and prevent intraday trading

## Important Dates

- **January 22, 2026:** Effective date for shift of 21 securities to T2T segment and retention of 20 securities in T2T segment
- **January 19, 2026:** Circular notification date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Significant reduction in liquidity for 41 affected securities due to mandatory delivery-based trading
- Elimination of intraday trading opportunities for speculators and day traders
- Reduced trading volumes expected as T2T segment requires higher capital commitment
- Tighter price band (5% or lower) limits price volatility but may also restrict price discovery

**Investor Impact:**
- Higher capital requirements as intraday leverage not available
- Increased holding period risk for traders
- Delivery obligation requires sufficient demat holdings for selling
- Potential exit difficulties due to reduced liquidity

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members must update surveillance and risk management systems
- Enhanced monitoring required for delivery failures
- Separate settlement tracking needed for T2T segment securities
