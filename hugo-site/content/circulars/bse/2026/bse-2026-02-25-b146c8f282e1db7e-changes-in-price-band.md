## Impact Assessment

The revision of price bands is a standard surveillance tool used by BSE to control volatility in securities that may be exhibiting unusual price movements or trading patterns. Scrips assigned narrower bands (2%) face the most restrictive trading conditions, potentially limiting liquidity and price discovery. Scrips at 20% retain relatively wider movement room. Traders and investors holding positions in these 17 scrips should be aware of the tighter daily limits, which could affect order execution and exit strategies particularly for illiquid counters.
