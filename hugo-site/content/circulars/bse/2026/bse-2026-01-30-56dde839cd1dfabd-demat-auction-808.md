## Impact Assessment

This demat auction affects brokers and clients who failed to deliver securities in Settlement 808. The auction mechanism ensures that buying brokers receive their securities while selling brokers fulfill their delivery obligations. The wide range of securities (98 scrips) indicates delivery failures across multiple trades. Notable impact on scrips with large quantities like HINDUSTAN CO, PARAS PETROF, and BARODA BNP P where substantial share volumes need to be auctioned.
