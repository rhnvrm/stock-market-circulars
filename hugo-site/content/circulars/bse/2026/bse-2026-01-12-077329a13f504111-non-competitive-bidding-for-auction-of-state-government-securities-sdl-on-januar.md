## Impact Assessment

This auction provides investment opportunities in state government debt securities across multiple states with varying maturities (2031-2056). The significant aggregate issuance size of Rs. 28,815 crores indicates substantial borrowing requirements by state governments. The non-competitive bidding facility enables retail and institutional investors to participate in SDL auctions without competing on yield, promoting wider participation in state government debt markets. Karnataka has the highest individual state issuance with three securities totaling Rs. 6,000 crores, while Mizoram has the smallest at Rs. 115 crores.
