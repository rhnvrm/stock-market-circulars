## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing announcement with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment increases the total equity base of Camlin Fine Sciences Limited by 41.06 lakh shares. The lock-in period until July 4, 2026 ensures that these shares cannot be traded freely for approximately 7 months from the trading commencement date, preventing immediate dilution impact. The share swap mechanism suggests a potential acquisition or restructuring activity by the company. Investors should note the ranking pari-passu status, meaning new shares have equal rights with existing shares.
