## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers and trading members must apply the applicable LT-ASM trading restrictions (e.g., enhanced margins, trade-for-trade settlement) for newly added securities from February 23, 2026
- Members must update their systems to reflect stage changes for securities in Part C
- Trading restrictions applicable to the 9 exiting securities under LT-ASM must be lifted from February 23, 2026, subject to any other applicable surveillance framework
- Securities exiting LT-ASM may still be under other frameworks (Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, IBC) where marked accordingly

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** February 23, 2026 — all additions, stage changes, and exits take effect
- **Circular Date:** February 20, 2026
- **Reference Notice:** Notice no. 20210604-41 applies to Direct Stage IV LT-ASM inclusions (Part D)

## Impact Assessment

The newly added securities (Part A) will face increased surveillance with restrictions such as higher margins and potentially trade-for-trade settlement, which may reduce liquidity and increase trading costs for investors in these scrips. Securities moving to lower stages (Part C) will see a relaxation of surveillance intensity, potentially improving liquidity. The nine securities exiting the LT-ASM framework will return to normal trading conditions (unless under another surveillance framework), which could improve investor confidence and liquidity in those stocks. Rajratan Global Wire and Chennai Petroleum Corporation, being relatively well-known companies, may see notable market reactions upon exit from the framework.
