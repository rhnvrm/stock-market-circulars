| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Date of Allotment | January 29, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

The listing of approximately 4.48 million new equity shares expands the total share capital of Suven Life Sciences Ltd. Since these shares are issued to Non-Promoters at Rs. 134.00 per share and are subject to a lock-in until August 30, 2026, there is no immediate increase in freely tradable float. Post lock-in expiry in late August 2026, the additional supply could exert moderate selling pressure depending on prevailing market conditions. The preferential allotment indicates the company raised capital through warrant conversion, which may reflect positively on its funding activity.
