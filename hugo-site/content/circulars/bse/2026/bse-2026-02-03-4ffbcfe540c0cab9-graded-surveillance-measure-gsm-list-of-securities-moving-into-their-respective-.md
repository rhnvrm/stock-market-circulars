---

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular announcing the movement of two securities into higher stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. Carnation Industries Ltd. (Security Code: 530609, ISIN: INE081B01028) is moving to GSM Stage III, while Pioneer Agro Extracts Ltd. (Security Code: 519439, ISIN: INE062E01014) is moving to GSM Stage IV, which represents a more stringent level of surveillance.

## Key Points

- Carnation Industries Ltd. (530609) moved to GSM Stage III
- Pioneer Agro Extracts Ltd. (519439) moved to GSM Stage IV
- Securities marked with (#) can move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM Framework
- Securities marked with ($) can move to lower GSM stages if included in IBC Framework
- Stage classifications may align with NSE framework

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements the existing GSM framework by moving specific securities to higher surveillance stages based on predefined criteria such as price volatility, volume patterns, or other surveillance parameters.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of the GSM stage classifications for these securities
- Enhanced margin requirements and trading restrictions applicable to GSM Stage III and IV securities must be followed
- Investors should note the increased surveillance status when trading these securities
- Brokers must ensure compliance with additional due diligence requirements for GSM securities

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: February 3, 2026
- Effective Date: Not explicitly mentioned, typically effective immediately or from next trading session

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - Movement to higher GSM stages typically results in reduced liquidity, wider bid-ask spreads, and increased trading costs due to higher margin requirements. Stage IV represents one of the highest surveillance levels, which may significantly deter retail participation.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding these securities will face stricter trading conditions, including potential delivery-only trading, higher margins (up to 100%), and ASM (Additional Surveillance Measure) restrictions. This may lead to price pressure and difficulty in exiting positions.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their risk management systems to apply appropriate margin and trading restrictions for these securities in their respective GSM stages.
