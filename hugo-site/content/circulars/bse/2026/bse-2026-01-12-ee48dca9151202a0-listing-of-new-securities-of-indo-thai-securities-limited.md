- **Date of Allotment**: October 31, 2025
- **Listing Date**: January 13, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with limited market impact. The listing increases the total equity capital of Indo Thai Securities Limited by 17,50,000 shares. The lock-in period until August 15, 2026 means these shares cannot be traded freely until that date, preventing immediate supply pressure. The preferential allotment to non-promoters indicates capital raising activity by the company through warrant conversion.
