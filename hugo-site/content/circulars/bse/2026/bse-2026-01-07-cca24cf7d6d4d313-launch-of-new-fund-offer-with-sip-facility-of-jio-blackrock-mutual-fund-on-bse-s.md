## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a routine NFO launch that adds two new debt fund options to the market. As these are debt funds (Low Duration and Short Duration categories), they target conservative investors seeking relatively stable returns.

**Operational Impact:** Standard operational procedures apply for BSE StAR MF Platform participants. Members need to follow established timelines for fund settlement and transaction processing.

**Investor Impact:** Provides new investment options in the debt fund category for investors preferring direct plans with growth options. The availability of SIP facility allows for systematic investment planning.

**Fund House Impact:** Expands JIO BLACKROCK MUTUAL FUND's debt fund offerings and distribution reach through the BSE StAR MF Platform.
