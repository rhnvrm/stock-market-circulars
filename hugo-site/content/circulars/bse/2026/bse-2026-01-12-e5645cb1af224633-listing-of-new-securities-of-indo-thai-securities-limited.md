## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification with minimal market impact. The addition of 17,50,000 shares to the tradable universe of Indo Thai Securities Limited represents an increase in the company's equity base. The lock-in period until August 15, 2026 means these shares will not be available for trading by the allottees until that date, limiting immediate supply impact. The preferential allotment to Non-Promoters at Rs. 50/- per share provides pricing reference for market participants.
