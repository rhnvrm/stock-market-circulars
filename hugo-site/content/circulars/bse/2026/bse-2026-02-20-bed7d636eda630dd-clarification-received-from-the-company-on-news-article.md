- The company commits to informing stock exchanges of any material developments regarding the greenfield facility.

## Important Dates

- **October 1, 2025**: Board approval for capacity expansion from 3.5 GWh to 20 GWh and ₹8,000 crore additional capex; original disclosure to stock exchanges.
- **February 19, 2026**: *The Hindu* news article published; BSE/NSE email sent to company requesting clarification.

## Impact Assessment

The clarification does not introduce materially new information beyond what was already disclosed in October 2025. However, it does confirm that active site selection discussions are underway with the Andhra Pradesh government, which may provide incremental market confidence regarding the timeline for the 20 GWh BESS manufacturing expansion. The ₹8,000 crore capex in a wholly owned subsidiary (Waaree Energy Storage Solutions Private Limited) is a substantial long-term investment that could strengthen Waaree's position in India's growing energy storage market. No immediate trading or compliance action is required by market participants.
