title: Split in Units of LIC MF Gold ETF - Face Value Change from Rs. 100 to Re. 1
---

## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Ltd has fixed a Record Date of March 6, 2026 for a change in face value (unit split) of LIC MF GOLD ETF (Scrip Code: 533719, ISIN: INF397L01554). The face value will change from Rs. 100 per unit to Re. 1 per unit, effectively a 100:1 split. The scheme will trade with the new face value from March 6, 2026 under Settlement No. DR-834/2025-2026.

## Key Points

- LIC MF GOLD ETF (Scrip Code: 533719) will undergo a face value split from Rs. 100 to Re. 1 per unit
- Record Date and Ex-Date are both set for March 6, 2026 (Settlement No. DR-834/2025-2026)
- Existing ISIN: INF397L01554 (old face value)
- New ISIN for the split units will be communicated via a separate notice
- The ETF will trade with the new face value effective March 6, 2026
- Circular issued by Marian Dsouza, Senior Manager – Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

The face value of each unit of LIC MF GOLD ETF is being changed from Rs. 100 to Re. 1 per unit. This is a structural change to the scheme's unit denomination. A new ISIN will be assigned to reflect the revised face value, replacing INF397L01554.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update systems to reflect the new face value of Re. 1 effective March 6, 2026
- Members should await the separate BSE notice announcing the new ISIN number before processing post-split transactions
- Depository participants and back-office systems must be updated for the ISIN change once announced

## Important Dates

- **Record Date:** March 6, 2026
- **Ex-Date:** March 6, 2026
- **Settlement Number:** DR-834/2025-2026
- **Effective date for new face value trading:** March 6, 2026
- **New ISIN announcement:** To be notified separately prior to March 6, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The 100:1 face value split will increase the number of units held by existing investors proportionately, while reducing the per-unit price to approximately 1/100th of the pre-split price. This improves affordability and liquidity of the ETF in the secondary market. Trading members and investors must update their systems for the new face value and ISIN. No economic impact on existing unitholders as total value remains unchanged. The pending new ISIN announcement is a critical follow-up action required before the ex-date.
