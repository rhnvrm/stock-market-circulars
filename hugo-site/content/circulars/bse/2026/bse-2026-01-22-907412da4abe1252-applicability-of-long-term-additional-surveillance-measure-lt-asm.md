- Brokers must ensure clients are informed about surveillance framework applicability

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 23, 2026 - New securities enter LT-ASM Framework
- **Circular Date**: January 22, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Four securities will face enhanced surveillance which may impact liquidity and trading volumes. Investors typically exercise greater caution with securities under surveillance frameworks.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading in the four newly listed securities should be aware of the enhanced surveillance status. This may lead to increased volatility or reduced liquidity.

**Operational Impact**: No securities are transitioning between stages or exiting the framework, indicating stable surveillance conditions for existing monitored securities. The consolidated list shows multiple securities across ASM Stages I, II, and IV continue under surveillance.
