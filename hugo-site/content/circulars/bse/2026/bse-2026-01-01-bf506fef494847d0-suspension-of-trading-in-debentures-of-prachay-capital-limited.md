1. **PCL-14.75%-7-3-29-UL-PVT** (ISIN: INE0IID07595, Code: 976837)
2. **PCL-14.75%-13-6-29-UL-PVT** (ISIN: INE0IID07603, Code: 976844)

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of these specific privately placed debentures. Since these are unlisted private placements, the trading suspension affects a restricted set of institutional investors rather than the broader market. The early redemption will provide liquidity to debenture holders along with accrued interest payments. No market-wide implications expected.
