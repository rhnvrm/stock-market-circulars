## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The preferential allotment significantly increases the equity base of ONIX SOLAR ENERGY LIMITED. The substantial promoter holding increase (approximately 1.85 crore shares) demonstrates promoter confidence and commitment to the company.

**Liquidity Impact**: The staggered lock-in structure means complete free float will only be achieved after July 2027. Approximately 77.9% of the new shares (1.44 crore) will unlock by July 2026, while the remaining 22.1% (40.98 lakh shares) remain locked until July 2027.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution from this preferential issue. The pricing at Rs. 264/- per share provides insight into the valuation at the time of allotment. The promoter-focused allotment strengthens management control while raising capital for business operations.
