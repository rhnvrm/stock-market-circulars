## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine operational notification for listing of shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants are required to take note of the newly listed securities
- The shares are available for trading from February 2, 2026
- Companies have complied with listing requirements for shares issued under employee benefit schemes

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 1, 2026
- **Listing and Trading Commencement Date**: February 2, 2026 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Period**: Not Applicable (NA) for all listed shares

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares represents a small fraction of the total outstanding shares for these large-cap and mid-cap companies. The shares are immediately available for trading without any lock-in restrictions.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in floating stock for each company. The largest addition is 492,119 shares for Le Travenues Technology, which is unlikely to affect overall market liquidity.

**Investor Consideration**: These listings represent employee compensation exercises and are part of normal corporate operations. No material impact on stock prices is expected from these routine listings.
