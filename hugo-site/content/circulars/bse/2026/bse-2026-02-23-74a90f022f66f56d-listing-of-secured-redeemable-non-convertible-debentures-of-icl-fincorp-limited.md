## Impact Assessment

This listing has limited broader market impact as it pertains to a privately placed debt issuance by ICL Fincorp Limited, a mid-sized NBFC. The CRISIL BBB-/Stable rating indicates adequate creditworthiness but is below investment-grade thresholds for many institutional investors. Retail and HNI investors holding these NCDs gain liquidity through BSE listing. The diversity of 10 options (monthly, annual, cumulative; tenors of 1–6 years; yields of 10.00%–12.25%) provides flexibility but also reflects the issuer's need to attract varied investor profiles.
