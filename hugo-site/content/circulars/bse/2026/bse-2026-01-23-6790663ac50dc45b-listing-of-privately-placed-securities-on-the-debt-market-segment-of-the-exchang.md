**Issuer Impact**: Positive for GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited, as it provides long-term funding (15-year tenure) at a competitive rate of 7.60% with strong credit ratings (AA+). The quarterly interest structure and reset rate mechanism offer flexibility.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to institutional and high-net-worth investors who participated in the private placement. The strong credit ratings and airport infrastructure backing provide relative safety for debt investors.
