---

## Summary

Fynx Capital Ltd (Scrip Code: 507962) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares, splitting each existing share of Rs. 10/- face value into ten shares of Re. 1/- face value each. The record date for this corporate action is February 25, 2026. The existing ISIN INE455H01013 will cease to be valid for transactions from the record date, and a new ISIN for Re. 1/- paid-up shares will be communicated separately.

## Key Points

- Company: Fynx Capital Ltd (Scrip Code: 507962)
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Split Ratio: 1:10 (One share of Rs. 10/- into Ten shares of Re. 1/-)
- Record Date: February 25, 2026
- Effective Date: February 25, 2026
- Current ISIN: INE455H01013 (Rs. 10/- paid-up)
- Current ISIN will be invalid for transactions from February 25, 2026
- New ISIN for Re. 1/- paid-up shares to be announced separately
- Notice Number: 20260204-37
- Segment: Equity (Dematerialised Securities - Rolling Settlement)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a company-specific corporate action involving share capital restructuring through sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that ISIN INE455H01013 will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after February 25, 2026
- Market participants should await notification of the new ISIN number for Re. 1/- paid-up shares
- All trading and settlement systems must be updated to reflect the new share structure and ISIN from the effective date
- Demat accounts will be automatically credited with subdivided shares as per the 1:10 ratio

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 4, 2026
- **Record Date**: February 25, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 25, 2026 (old ISIN becomes invalid, new paid-up value Re. 1/- takes effect)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares tenfold while reducing the face value proportionally, making shares more affordable for retail investors. This typically improves liquidity and trading activity.

**Operational Impact**: Moderate operational impact requiring:
- System updates for new ISIN and face value changes
- Automatic adjustment of shareholdings in demat accounts
- Update of all corporate records and share certificates
- Recalculation of per-share metrics (EPS, book value, etc.)

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. The total value of holdings remains unchanged, but the per-share price will adjust proportionally. Lower share price may attract more retail participation.
