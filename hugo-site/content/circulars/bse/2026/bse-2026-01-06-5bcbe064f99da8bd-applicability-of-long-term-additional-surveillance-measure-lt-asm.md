## Summary

BSE has updated the list of securities under the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective January 07, 2026. Four new securities have been shortlisted in LT-ASM, two securities will move to higher ASM stages while continuing in the framework, and three securities are moving out of LT-ASM due to inclusion in other surveillance frameworks.

## Key Points

- 4 new securities shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Lokesh Machines Ltd, Precision Electronics Ltd, S&S Power Switchgear Ltd, and United Van Der Horst Ltd
- 2 securities moving to higher ASM Stage II: Fabino Enterprises Ltd and Soma Papers & Industries Ltd
- 3 securities moving out of LT-ASM: Aerpace Industries Ltd (to ESM), Karnavati Finance Ltd (to GSM), and Kinetic Trust Ltd (to ESM)
- No securities moving to lower ASM stages
- No securities shortlisted directly in Stage IV
- Changes effective from January 07, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework continues to identify securities with specific surveillance concerns based on price movements, volatility, and other market parameters. Securities under LT-ASM face additional trading restrictions and margin requirements to protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable margin requirements for securities under LT-ASM
- Enhanced disclosure obligations apply to trades in ASM securities
- Price-to-price trading mechanism applies with specific percentage bands based on ASM stage
- Physical settlement requirements may apply for certain ASM stage securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 07, 2026 - All changes to LT-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited direct market impact as only 7 securities are affected by new classifications. However, traders and investors in these specific securities will face enhanced surveillance measures.

**Operational Impact**: 
- Trading members need to update their risk management systems for the newly included securities
- Investors holding affected securities should be aware of additional trading restrictions
- Securities moving to higher ASM stages (Fabino Enterprises and Soma Papers & Industries) will face stricter surveillance measures
- Securities moving out to ESM/GSM frameworks will be subject to different surveillance parameters

**Investor Impact**: Investors in the 4 newly shortlisted securities and 2 securities moving to higher stages should expect reduced liquidity and higher margin requirements.
