## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework is a surveillance mechanism to enhance market integrity and safeguard investor interests. Securities under ESM are subject to:

- Additional surveillance and monitoring
- Potential trading restrictions based on ESM stage
- Progressive action framework with multiple stages
- Trade-for-trade settlement in many cases
- Price bands and position limits

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the ESM classification of listed securities
- Trading in ESM securities may be subject to additional margins and restrictions
- Brokers should inform clients about securities under ESM framework
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in ESM securities
- Surveillance measures increase progressively with higher ESM stages

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 9, 2026
- **Circular Date**: January 8, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Securities added to or moved within the ESM framework face increased scrutiny and trading restrictions, which typically results in reduced liquidity and increased volatility. Investors holding these securities need to be aware of the surveillance measures and potential trading limitations.

**Investor Impact**: Investors and traders dealing in the affected securities must exercise caution. ESM classification indicates regulatory concerns about price movements, volatility, or market activity in these securities. The framework aims to protect investors by flagging securities that require closer monitoring.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ESM may have additional margin requirements, position limits, and could be moved to trade-for-trade settlement, significantly impacting trading strategies and liquidity.
