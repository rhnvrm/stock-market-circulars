## Summary

BSE received clarifications from two companies regarding news articles published on January 8, 2026. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) clarified news about contracts awarded to Technip Energies, confirming three letters of intent issued in November 2025 for refinery projects totaling approximately Rs. 4,117 crore. Vedanta Limited responded to news about Delhi High Court examining the government's refusal to extend their contract, referring to their previous disclosure from September 2025.

## Key Points

- BPCL awarded three contracts to Technip Energies Limited via letters of intent dated November 24, 2025
- EPCC package for Polypropylene and Butene-1 unit at Bina Refinery: Rs. 3,600 crore
- EPCM services for PRFCC Unit at Mumbai Refinery: Rs. 467 crore
- EPCM services for Hydrocracker Unit revamp at Mumbai Refinery: Rs. 50 crore
- BPCL stated all contracts are in ordinary course of business and capital expenditure nature
- BPCL does not envisage price movement due to these contracts
- Vedanta referred to their September 23, 2025 disclosure regarding Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas intimation

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

Companies provided clarifications as required under Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 in response to exchange queries about news articles.

## Important Dates

- November 24, 2025: BPCL issued letters of intent to Technip Energies Limited
- January 8, 2026: News articles published and clarifications requested by exchanges
- January 8, 2026: Companies submitted clarifications to BSE and NSE
- September 19, 2025: Vedanta received intimation from Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (referenced)
- September 23, 2025: Vedanta's previous disclosure (letter VEDL/Sec./SE/25-26/113)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. BPCL explicitly stated no material impact expected on share price as contracts are in ordinary course of business. The total contract value of Rs. 4,117 crore represents capital expenditure for refinery expansion and modernization projects. Vedanta's response is a continuation of previously disclosed matters. Both clarifications are procedural responses to exchange queries rather than new material information requiring immediate disclosure.
