## Regulatory Changes

### Investor Classification Requirements

**Accredited Investor**: Minimum investment as per AMC-specified amounts in SID

**Non-Accredited Investor**: Mandatory ₹10 lakh minimum investment threshold

**AUM Maintenance**: All SIF clients must maintain minimum ₹10 lakh AUM; cannot fall below this threshold due to redemptions

### Distributor Registration

- New and existing members must complete NISM XIII examination
- Mandatory AMFI registration required for SIF distribution
- Only registered distributors will be auto-mapped/empanelled with AMC
- Exchange does not validate distributor registration; unregistered member transactions may be rejected by AMC/RTA

### Mode of Holding Rules for Accredited Investor Status

1. **Single Holder**: If first holder is AI, AI exemptions apply across all transaction types
2. **Joint Holders (FH=AI, JH=Non-AI)**: AI exemptions apply for all transactions
3. **Joint Holders (FH=AI, JH=AI)**: AI exemptions apply for all transactions
4. **Joint Holders (FH=Non-AI, JH=AI)**: AI exemptions do NOT apply; processed under normal SIF regulations with limitations

## Compliance Requirements

### For Members/Distributors

1. Complete NISM XIII examination and obtain AMFI registration for SIF distribution
2. Update Accredited Investor details accurately through:
   - Manual entry: Admin >> Client Details >> Client Master Upload
   - Bulk upload: Pipe-separated text file format (Member Code | Client Code | PAN Number | Accredited No. | Validity)
3. Verify Accredited Investor details using Accredited Client Report (Admin >> Admin Reports >> Accredited Client Report)
4. Exercise utmost care in updating correct AI details to avoid rejections and client refunds from AMC/RTA
5. Ensure AI details are current and valid before order entry as details are frozen at order entry level

### For Investors

1. **Non-Accredited Investors**: Invest minimum ₹10 lakh for first-time investment
2. **Accredited Investors**: 
   - Meet minimum investment amounts per AMC's SID
   - Maintain valid Accredited Investor registration certificate

2. Monitor client AUM to ensure ₹10 lakh minimum threshold compliance
3. Validate Accredited Investor status and certificate validity
4. Process transactions according to mode of holding and AI status rules

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 5, 2026 (circular issuance date)
- **Ongoing**: Accredited Investor certificates must be renewed prior to expiry
- **Ongoing**: AUM monitoring to maintain ₹10 lakh minimum threshold

## Impact Assessment

### Market Impact

**High impact on mutual fund distribution ecosystem**: Introduction of SIF category creates new product segment with stricter eligibility criteria, potentially limiting retail participation while opening opportunities for high-net-worth and institutional investors.

### Operational Impact

**Distributors**: Must invest in NISM XIII certification and AMFI registration, creating entry barriers and compliance costs. Risk of transaction rejection if registration requirements not met.

**Investors**: Non-accredited investors face high entry barrier (₹10 lakh minimum), restricting access to specialized investment strategies. Accredited investors gain access to potentially differentiated investment products.

**AMCs/RTAs**: Operational complexity increases with separate AMC structure, dual investor classification tracking, AUM threshold monitoring, and AI certificate validation processes.

### Technology Impact

**Platform Enhancements**: BSE StAR MF platform upgraded with manual and bulk upload capabilities for AI details, new validation rules for mode of holding scenarios, and reporting functionality for AI client tracking.

**Data Management**: Members responsible for accurate AI data entry with details frozen at order entry; data quality critical to avoid rejections and operational issues.
