- **No Dealings From:** February 12, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and traders of the two specific REC LIMITED bonds. Bondholders will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms of the bonds. The suspension is routine for bonds approaching maturity and redemption. Market liquidity for these specific securities will cease from February 12, 2026. No broader market impact is expected as this affects only two specific debt securities.
