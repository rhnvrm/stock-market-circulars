## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This rights issue involves significant dilution with a 22:1 ratio, meaning the share capital will expand substantially. Existing shareholders will have the opportunity to maintain their proportionate ownership by subscribing to the rights issue.

**Shareholder Impact**: Shareholders on record as of February 11, 2026 will be eligible to participate in the rights issue. The at-par pricing (Rs. 10/-) matches the face value, which may indicate the company is raising capital without offering a discount.

**Trading Impact**: Trading on ex-rights basis from February 11, 2026 means the stock price will be adjusted to reflect the rights entitlement separation from that date forward.
