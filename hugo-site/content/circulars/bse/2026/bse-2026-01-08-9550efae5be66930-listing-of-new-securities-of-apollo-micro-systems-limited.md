## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine listing of preferential allotment shares from warrant conversion. The 65.69 lakh shares represent a capital raise of approximately Rs. 7.49 crore at the issue price of Rs. 114 per share.

**Operational Impact**: The majority of shares (61.15 lakh) are locked in until July 2027, with only 4.54 lakh shares having a shorter lock-in until July 2026. This limits immediate supply to the market and reduces short-term dilution impact on existing shareholders.
