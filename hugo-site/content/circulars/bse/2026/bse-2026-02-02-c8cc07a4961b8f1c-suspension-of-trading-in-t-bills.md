## Key Points

- Two T-Bills will be suspended from trading effective February 3, 2026
- Scrip Code 805101 (ISIN: IN002025Y198) - 182TB05226
- Scrip Code 805024 (ISIN: IN002024Z438) - 364TB50226
- Trading members must not execute any transactions in these securities from the suspension date
- Notice reference: DR-882/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard operational notice for securities reaching maturity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all trading activities in the specified T-Bills from February 3, 2026
- Members should update their systems to block transactions in these securities
- No new positions should be created in these instruments

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 2, 2026
- **Trading Suspension Effective Date**: February 3, 2026
- **Maturity/Redemption Date**: On or around February 3, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine operational matter affecting only two specific T-Bill securities that are reaching natural maturity. The suspension prevents trading in securities that are about to be redeemed.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure their systems are updated to prevent inadvertent trading in these securities. Investors holding these T-Bills will receive redemption proceeds as per standard settlement procedures.
