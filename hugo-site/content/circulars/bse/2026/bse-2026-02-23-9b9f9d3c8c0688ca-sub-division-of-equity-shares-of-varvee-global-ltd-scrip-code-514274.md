title: 'Sub-Division of Equity Shares of Varvee Global Ltd (Scrip Code: 514274)'
---

## Summary

Varvee Global Ltd (BSE Scrip Code: 514274) has announced a sub-division (stock split) of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of Rs. 10/- paid-up will be split into two equity shares of Rs. 5/- paid-up each. The record date is fixed as **March 2, 2026**, effective under Notice DR-831/2025-2026.

## Key Points

- Existing shares of Rs. 10/- face value will be split into two shares of Rs. 5/- face value each (2-for-1 split).
- Record date for the sub-division: **02/03/2026**.
- The sub-divided paid-up value of Rs. 5/- per share is effective from **02/03/2026**.
- Existing ISIN **INE273D01019** (Rs. 10/- paid-up) will be **invalid** for exchange transactions on or after 02/03/2026.
- A new ISIN for the Rs. 5/- paid-up shares will be communicated via a separate BSE notice.
- Applicable to the Dematerialised Securities – Rolling Settlement segment.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework is introduced. This is a corporate action (stock split) executed under existing BSE listing and settlement regulations. The change in ISIN is a procedural requirement under SEBI depository regulations when face value is altered.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must note the ISIN change and ensure no transactions are executed using the old ISIN (INE273D01019) on or after 02/03/2026.
- **Depositories/Custodians**: Must update beneficiary accounts to reflect the new share count and face value post record date.
- **Market Participants**: Await BSE's separate notice for the new ISIN number before executing post-split transactions.

## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Notice Date | February 23, 2026 |
| Record Date for Sub-Division | March 2, 2026 |
| Old ISIN (INE273D01019) validity ends | March 1, 2026 (last valid date) |
| New Rs. 5/- ISIN effective | March 2, 2026 (ISIN TBA) |

## Impact Assessment

The sub-division doubles the number of outstanding equity shares while halving the face value, leaving shareholders' proportional ownership unchanged. The immediate market impact includes a theoretical halving of the per-share price on the ex-date, increased share liquidity due to lower price per unit, and a mandatory ISIN migration. Trading members and clearing members must update their systems before the record date to avoid settlement failures. Retail investors holding shares in demat form will see their holdings automatically updated by their depository participant post record date.
