## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a one-time market closure announcement for a specific public holiday.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the complete closure of equity and equity derivatives segments on January 15, 2026
- Trading members must be aware of preponed expiry for equity derivatives contracts from January 15 to January 14, 2026
- Trading members must refer to updated end-of-day contract master files for expiry date changes
- Trading members planning commodity derivatives or EGR transactions must note the modified evening-only trading hours

## Important Dates

- **January 12, 2026**: Notice issued; updated contract master files with preponed expiry dates
- **January 14, 2026**: Preponed expiry date for equity derivatives contracts originally scheduled for January 15, 2026
- **January 15, 2026**: Trading holiday - equity and equity derivatives segments completely closed; commodity derivatives available 5:00 pm to 11:55 pm; EGR available 5:00 pm to 9:30 pm

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Complete closure of equity and equity derivatives segments affects all equity market participants. The preponing of derivatives expiry to January 14, 2026 will concentrate settlement activity and may increase volatility on that day.

**Operational Impact**: High - Trading members need to adjust their operations, inform clients about the holiday, and ensure proper handling of derivatives expiry preponed to January 14. Risk management systems must be updated to reflect the modified expiry dates.

**Segment-Specific Impact**:
- **Equity & Equity Derivatives**: Complete closure eliminates trading, clearing, and settlement activities
- **Commodity Derivatives**: Partial impact with morning session closed but evening session (5:00 pm to 11:55 pm) operational
- **Electronic Gold Receipts**: Partial impact with morning session closed but evening session (5:00 pm to 9:30 pm) operational

**Liquidity Impact**: Significant reduction in overall market liquidity on January 15, with potential spillover effects on January 14 due to preponed derivatives expiry.
