title: Clarifications from Reliance Infrastructure and Jindal Poly Films on News Articles
---

## Summary

BSE sought clarifications from two listed companies regarding news articles that may have affected their stock prices. Reliance Infrastructure Limited clarified that the ED's Provisional Attachment Order reported in media pertains to Reliance Communications Limited — a separate entity — and not to itself, making no disclosure obligatory. Jindal Poly Films Limited clarified that NCLAT dismissed its appeal (Company Appeal (AT) No. 47 of 2026) on February 26, 2026, against an NCLT order dated February 5, 2026, and confirmed no merger/acquisition negotiations are underway.

## Key Points

- **Reliance Infrastructure (BSE: 500390 | NSE: RELINFRA):** ED's Provisional Attachment Order referenced in media and ED Press Release dated February 25, 2026, relates to an investigation under PMLA 2002 concerning Reliance Communications Limited, not Reliance Infrastructure; company asserts no disclosure is warranted under applicable regulations.
- **Jindal Poly Films Limited:** NCLAT (New Delhi) dismissed Company Appeal (AT) No. 47 of 2026 on February 26, 2026, which was an appeal against NCLT Principal Bench New Delhi order dated February 5, 2026.
- Jindal Poly Films confirmed it has not entered into any negotiations with any counterparty as of the date of the clarification.
- Both companies stated they are unaware of any information explaining trading price/volume movement in their respective securities.
- Jindal Poly Films committed to promptly notify stock exchanges of any future developments under SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015.

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. These are company-level clarifications submitted in compliance with BSE's rumour verification / price movement query process under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- Both companies responded to BSE's rumour verification queries as mandated under SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015.
- Jindal Poly Films undertook to make further disclosures to exchanges as required under applicable provisions of the Listing Regulations for any material developments arising from the NCLAT/NCLT matter.
- Reliance Infrastructure confirmed no further disclosure is warranted given the enforcement action does not pertain to the company.

## Important Dates

- **February 25, 2026:** ED Press Release regarding Provisional Attachment Order (pertaining to Reliance Communications).
- **February 5, 2026:** NCLT Principal Bench New Delhi order in the matter involving Jindal Poly Films.
- **February 6, 2026:** Jindal Poly Films disclosed filing of NCLAT appeal and NCLT admission to stock exchanges.
- **February 26, 2026:** BSE queries issued; NCLAT dismissed Jindal Poly Films' appeal (Company Appeal (AT) No. 47 of 2026); both clarification letters submitted.

## Impact Assessment

**Reliance Infrastructure:** The clarification is broadly positive for the stock — it explicitly distances the company from ED enforcement action. However, the association with Reliance Communications under PMLA investigation may continue to cause market sensitivity. No material compliance or financial impact on Reliance Infrastructure is indicated.

**Jindal Poly Films:** The NCLAT dismissal closes one appellate avenue and represents an adverse legal outcome. The company's confirmation that no negotiations are ongoing removes M&A-related speculation. Further disclosures are likely as the underlying NCLT matter (order dated February 5, 2026) progresses. Investors should monitor subsequent filings for material developments related to the NCLT proceedings.
