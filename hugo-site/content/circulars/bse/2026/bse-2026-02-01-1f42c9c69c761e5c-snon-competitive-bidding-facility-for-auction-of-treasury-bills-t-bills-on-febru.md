## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine government securities auction facilitated through BSE's established NCB platform. It provides retail and institutional investors access to government debt instruments.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - Trading members already familiar with the NCB-GSec module from previous auctions. Standard bidding procedures apply.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for debt investors seeking government-backed instruments with varying maturity periods (3 months to 1 year). The non-competitive facility allows smaller investors to participate without competing on yields.
