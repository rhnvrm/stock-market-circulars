## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 12, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of over 2.30 crore new equity shares represents significant dilution for existing shareholders. However, the lock-in period until June 30, 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure on the stock.

**Shareholding Impact**: This preferential allotment to Non-Promoters will alter the company's shareholding pattern, potentially reducing promoter holding percentage and increasing public float.

**Liquidity Impact**: Post lock-in expiry in June 2026, the increased free float could improve liquidity in the stock. The issue price of Rs.185/- provides a reference point for valuation.

**Investor Consideration**: Existing shareholders should note the dilutive impact. The conversion from CCDs indicates prior fundraising activity, and investors should review the company's utilization of these funds and business performance.
