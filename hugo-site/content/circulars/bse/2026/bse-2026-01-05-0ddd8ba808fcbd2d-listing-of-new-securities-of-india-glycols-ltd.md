## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of approximately 51 lakh new shares represents a capital raise for India Glycols Ltd. The staggered lock-in periods (July 2026 and July 2027) will limit immediate selling pressure. With 42.8% of shares (21.86 lakh) locked until July 2027 and 57.2% (29.18 lakh) locked until July 2026, the market will see gradual supply increase over the next 18 months.

**Shareholder Impact**: The preferential allotment dilutes existing shareholders. At Rs. 915/- per share, the total capital raised is approximately Rs. 46.72 crores. The pari-passu ranking ensures new shareholders have equal rights with existing equity holders.

**Trading Impact**: Investors and traders should account for the increased share count in valuation metrics and be aware of lock-in release dates that may affect stock liquidity and price.
