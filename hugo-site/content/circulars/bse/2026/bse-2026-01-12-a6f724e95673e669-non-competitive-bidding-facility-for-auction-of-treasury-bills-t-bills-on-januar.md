## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine debt market operation for government securities. The auction provides liquidity management opportunity for institutional and retail investors seeking risk-free short-term instruments.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Standard bidding process using existing BSE infrastructure. No changes to existing procedures or systems.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to debt market participants interested in Treasury Bills. Provides non-competitive bidding access to government securities auction, eliminating price discovery risk for small investors.

**Liquidity**: The total issue size of Rs. 29,000 crore represents standard T-Bill auction volume and will not materially impact market liquidity.
