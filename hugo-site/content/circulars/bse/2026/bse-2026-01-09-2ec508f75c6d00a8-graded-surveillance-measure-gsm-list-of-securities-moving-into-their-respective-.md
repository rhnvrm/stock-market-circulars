## Securities Details

| Security Code | ISIN | Security Name | GSM Stage |
|---------------|------|---------------|----------|
| 530035 | INE612D01018 | Santosh Fine-Fab Ltd. | I |
| 531083 | INE876E01033 | Nihar Info Global Ltd. | I |
| 526711 | INE627D01016 | Adarsh Plant Protect Ltd. | II |

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework applies progressive surveillance measures based on the stage:
- **Stage I**: Entry level surveillance with basic restrictions
- **Stage II**: Intermediate surveillance with enhanced monitoring
- **Stage III**: Higher surveillance with stricter trading conditions

Higher GSM stages typically involve additional disclosure requirements, trade-for-trade settlement, and price bands to protect investors.

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies in GSM stages must comply with enhanced disclosure norms
- Investors trading in these securities should be aware of applicable restrictions
- Brokers must ensure clients are informed about GSM status of securities
- Trading members must adhere to settlement and margin requirements specific to GSM securities

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: January 9, 2026
- Effective Date: As per exchange notification (typically immediate or next trading day)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The movement of securities into GSM stages will result in reduced liquidity and trading activity for the affected stocks. Higher stages impose stricter trading conditions including additional margins, price bands, and trade-for-trade settlement, which typically deter speculative trading.

**Investor Impact**: Existing investors in these securities may face challenges in exiting positions due to reduced liquidity. New investors will face higher entry barriers and margin requirements.

**Company Impact**: Companies moved to higher GSM stages may experience reputational concerns and reduced investor interest, potentially affecting their ability to raise capital through equity markets.
