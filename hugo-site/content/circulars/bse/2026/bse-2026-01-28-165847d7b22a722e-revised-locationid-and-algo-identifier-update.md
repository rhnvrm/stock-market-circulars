## Summary

BSE has issued a final reminder for trading members to update the requisite 14th digit in their locationid on or before March 31, 2026. This follows the earlier notice dated December 23, 2025 (Notice No. 20251223-22) regarding revised locationid and algo identifier requirements. The exchange has emphasized that no further extension will be granted beyond this deadline.

## Key Points

- Trading members must update the 14th digit in locationid by March 31, 2026
- This is a follow-up to BSE Notice No. 20251223-22 dated December 23, 2025
- No further extensions will be granted beyond the March 31, 2026 deadline
- Trading members can contact BSE Helpdesk for queries at 022-45720400/600, 022-69158500, or bsehelp@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

This circular does not introduce new regulatory changes but enforces compliance with previously announced revisions to locationid and algo identifier requirements issued in December 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Applicable to**: All trading members of BSE
- **Action required**: Update the requisite 14th digit in locationid
- **Deadline**: On or before March 31, 2026

- **Current Notice Date**: January 28, 2026
- **Compliance Deadline**: March 31, 2026 (final, no extensions)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: High - Trading members must ensure their technical systems are updated to comply with the revised locationid format. Failure to comply by the deadline may result in trading disruptions or operational issues.

**Market Impact**: Medium - While this is a technical update affecting trading infrastructure, non-compliance could affect trading member operations and their ability to execute trades on the BSE platform.

**Urgency**: High - With approximately 2 months remaining until the final deadline and no further extensions permitted, trading members must prioritize this technical update to avoid potential operational disruptions.
