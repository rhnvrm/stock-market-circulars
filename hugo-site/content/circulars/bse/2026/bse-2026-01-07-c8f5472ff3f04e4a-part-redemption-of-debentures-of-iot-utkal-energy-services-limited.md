## Impact Assessment

**Debenture Holders**: Directly impacted as they will receive partial redemption proceeds. The face value reduction indicates the portion of principal being returned. For INE310L07AB7, the new face value is Rs. 57,627.12 per debenture, and for INE310L07AE1, it is Rs. 19,680 per debenture.

**Trading Members**: Must update trading systems to reflect reduced face values for both debenture series from January 13, 2026 onwards.

**Market Impact**: Limited to debt segment participants holding or trading these specific debentures. No broader equity market impact expected.

**Liquidity**: Trading will continue post-redemption but at reduced face values, which may affect pricing calculations and accrued interest computations.
