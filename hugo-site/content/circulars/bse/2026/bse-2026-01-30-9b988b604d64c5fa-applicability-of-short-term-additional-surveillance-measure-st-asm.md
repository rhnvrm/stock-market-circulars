## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term ASM framework is a surveillance mechanism to monitor securities showing abnormal price movements. Securities may exit ST-ASM due to:
- Inclusion in Long Term ASM (LT-ASM) Framework
- Inclusion in Trade for Trade Framework
- Inclusion in Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) Framework
- Inclusion in Pledge Framework
- Inclusion in Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised list for trading purposes
- Securities under ST-ASM are subject to additional trading restrictions and surveillance
- Investors should be aware of enhanced monitoring on these securities
- Brokers must ensure compliance with ASM framework requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 01, 2026
- All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

The ST-ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities with unusual price movements and protect market integrity. Securities entering the framework face enhanced surveillance and may experience:
- Increased scrutiny of trading activity
- Potential trading restrictions based on ASM stage
- Greater disclosure requirements
- Investor awareness about volatility risks

The exit of 9 securities indicates normalization of trading patterns, while entry of 10 new securities suggests emerging concerns requiring monitoring. The framework includes provisions for SME scrips and alignment with NSE surveillance measures.
