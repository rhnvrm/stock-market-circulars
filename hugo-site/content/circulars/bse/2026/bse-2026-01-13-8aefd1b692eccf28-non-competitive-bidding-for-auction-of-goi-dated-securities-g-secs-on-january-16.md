## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - Routine government securities auction that is part of regular debt market operations. The non-competitive bidding facility provides institutional participants and retail investors access to G-sec primary issuances.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Standard process using established BSE iBBS platform. Trading members and direct investors familiar with the NCB-GSec module can participate without operational changes.

**Liquidity Impact**: Neutral - G-sec auctions add to government debt market depth. The Rs 31,000 crore issue size is routine for sovereign debt issuances.
