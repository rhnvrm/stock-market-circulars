## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 20, 2026
- **Trading Commencement Date**: January 21, 2026 (Wednesday)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine corporate action involving conversion of partly paid shares to fully paid status. The relatively small number of shares (40,950) represents a minor addition to the company's tradable float. The pari-passu status ensures these shares have identical rights as existing equity shares, maintaining uniformity in shareholder treatment.
