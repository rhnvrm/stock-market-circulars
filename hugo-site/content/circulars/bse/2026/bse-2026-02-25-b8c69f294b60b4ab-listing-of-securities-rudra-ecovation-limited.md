## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that 2,220,000 new equity shares of Rudra Ecovation Limited (Scrip Code: 514010) are listed and permitted to trade on the Exchange with effect from Thursday, February 26, 2026. The shares were issued to promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to conversion of warrants at an issue price of Rs. 48.00 per share (face value Rs. 1/- plus premium of Rs. 47.00).

## Key Points

- 2,220,000 equity shares of Rs. 1/- each issued at a premium of Rs. 47.00 per share (issue price Rs. 48.00/-)
- Issued to promoters on a preferential basis via conversion of warrants
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares of the company
- Distribution numbers: 116058001 to 118278000
- ISIN: INE723D01021
- Date of allotment: January 9, 2026
- Effective trading date: February 26, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification under BSE's procedures for newly allotted securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities and permitted to trade them from February 26, 2026
- All 2,220,000 shares are subject to a lock-in period and cannot be freely traded until the lock-in expiry date

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** January 9, 2026
- **Listing / Trading Effective Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry Date:** November 1, 2027 (for all 2,220,000 shares, Dist. Nos. 116058001 to 118278000)

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 2,220,000 shares to the tradeable universe of Rudra Ecovation Limited, though these shares are locked in until November 1, 2027, meaning no immediate increase in free-float. The preferential allotment to promoters at Rs. 48.00 per share reflects the conversion price of the underlying warrants. Market impact is expected to be minimal given the lock-in restriction and the relatively small size of the issuance.
