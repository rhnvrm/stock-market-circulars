## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact: Low.** These are routine short-term debt instrument listings with no implications for equity markets. The CPs carry top-tier credit ratings (A1+) from CARE, CRISIL, and ICRA, indicating minimal credit risk. Redemption timelines range from approximately 3 months (May 2026) to 12 months (February 2027), with Vivriti Capital's CP offering the highest yield at 9.41% p.a., reflecting its relatively longer tenor (August 2026). Total issuance across the disclosed CPs amounts to Rs. 15,250 crore face value (30,500 units × Rs. 5 Lakhs each, partial count). This information is relevant primarily to institutional debt market participants and fixed-income traders on the BSE Debt Segment.
