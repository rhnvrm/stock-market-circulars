title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Securities Moving Into GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of three securities into their respective Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages effective from this circular. GSM is a regulatory framework designed to protect investors from potential price manipulation and abnormal price movements in securities that exhibit suspicious trading patterns or poor fundamentals.

## Key Points

- Three securities are being moved into GSM stages as part of BSE's ongoing surveillance mechanism.
- MFS Intercorp Ltd (Code: 513721, ISIN: INE614F01019) is placed under **GSM Stage I**.
- Blue Chip India Ltd (Code: 531936, ISIN: INE657B01025) is placed under **GSM Stage II**.
- Karnawati Innovation Ltd (Code: 531671, ISIN: INE214D01021) is placed under **GSM Stage III**.
- Securities marked (#) move to a lower GSM stage due to inclusion in the ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure) Framework.
- Securities marked ($) move to a lower GSM stage due to inclusion in the IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) Framework.

## Regulatory Changes

Under the GSM framework, securities are classified into multiple stages (I through VI) based on their surveillance risk profile. Each stage imposes progressively stricter trading conditions, including:
- Reduced price bands
- Mandatory trade-for-trade settlement
- Requirement for additional margins
- Periodic review before reclassification or removal

Higher GSM stages (e.g., Stage III for Karnawati Innovation Ltd) indicate more severe restrictions compared to lower stages.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Brokers and trading members** must ensure clients are informed of the GSM status before executing trades in these securities.
- **Investors** holding or intending to trade these securities must be aware of the applicable trading restrictions and settlement conditions specific to their GSM stage.
- Trades in GSM-listed securities may require upfront margins and are subject to trade-for-trade settlement norms.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** 2026-02-20 (date of circular issuance)
- The GSM status of securities is reviewed periodically; upliftment from GSM stages is subject to improvement in surveillance parameters.

## Impact Assessment

- **MFS Intercorp Ltd (GSM Stage I):** Entry-level surveillance restrictions apply. Liquidity may be marginally impacted with tighter price bands.
- **Blue Chip India Ltd (GSM Stage II):** Moderate restrictions with stricter settlement norms. Investors may face higher margin requirements, reducing trading activity.
- **Karnawati Innovation Ltd (GSM Stage III):** Significant trading restrictions apply. The security will likely see a sharp reduction in trading volumes due to stringent surveillance conditions.
- Overall, placement under GSM signals regulatory concern about these securities and may affect investor sentiment, potentially leading to reduced participation and liquidity across all three counters.
