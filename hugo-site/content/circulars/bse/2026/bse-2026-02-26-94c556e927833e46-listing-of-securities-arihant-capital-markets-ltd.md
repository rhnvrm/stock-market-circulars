## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that 50,00,000 (5 million) new equity shares of Arihant Capital Markets Ltd. (Scrip Code: 511605, ISIN: INE420B01036) are listed and permitted to trade on the Exchange with effect from Friday, February 27, 2026. These shares were allotted to Promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to conversion of warrants at an issue price of Rs. 68.50/- per share (face value Rs. 1.00/- + premium of Rs. 67.50/-).

## Key Points

- **5,000,000 equity shares** of Rs. 1.00/- face value each listed on BSE effective February 27, 2026
- Shares issued at a **premium of Rs. 67.50/-**, making the total issue price **Rs. 68.50/- per share**
- Allotted to **Promoters on a preferential basis** pursuant to **conversion of warrants**
- Shares rank **pari-passu** with existing equity shares of the company
- Distribution Nos.: **104612801 to 109612800**
- Date of Allotment: **November 22, 2025**
- ISIN: **INE420B01036**
- Entire allotment of 5,000,000 shares is subject to **lock-in until September 5, 2027**

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a routine listing notification under BSE norms for securities allotted on a preferential basis.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to update their records for the new securities of Arihant Capital Markets Ltd. (Scrip Code: 511605)
- The newly listed shares carry a lock-in restriction and cannot be traded by the allottees (Promoters) until September 5, 2027
- No action required from retail trading members beyond awareness of the new securities

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** November 22, 2025
- **Listing/Trading Effective Date:** February 27, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry Date:** September 5, 2027

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 5 million new equity shares to the tradable float of Arihant Capital Markets Ltd. (Scrip Code: 511605). However, since the entire allotment is locked in until September 5, 2027, there is **no immediate increase in free-float** or selling pressure from this allotment. The preferential allotment to promoters at Rs. 68.50/- signals promoter confidence at that price level. Market impact is expected to be minimal in the near term given the lock-in. Investors should monitor the lock-in expiry in September 2027 for potential supply-side implications.
