## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that 1,050,000 new equity shares of Rudra Ecovation Limited (Scrip Code: 514010) are listed and permitted to trade on the Exchange with effect from February 26, 2026. These shares were issued to Non-Promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to the conversion of warrants at an issue price of Rs. 48.00 per share.

## Key Points

- 1,050,000 equity shares of face value Rs. 1.00/- each issued at a premium of Rs. 47.00 per share
- Issued to Non-Promoters on a preferential basis via conversion of warrants
- New shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares of the company
- Distribution numbers: 118278001 to 119328000
- ISIN: INE723D01021
- All 1,050,000 shares are subject to lock-in until October 1, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification pursuant to a preferential allotment and warrant conversion already approved by the company.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed that the new securities are available for trading from February 26, 2026
- The lock-in restriction on all 1,050,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 118278001 to 119328000) must be observed until October 1, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** January 10, 2026
- **Listing / Trading Effective Date:** February 26, 2026 (Thursday)
- **Lock-in Expiry:** October 1, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing of these 1,050,000 equity shares represents a moderate equity dilution for existing shareholders of Rudra Ecovation Limited. Market impact is limited in the near term as the entire tranche is under lock-in until October 1, 2026, meaning these shares cannot be traded until that date. Post lock-in expiry, the release of these shares into the market could introduce incremental selling pressure depending on market conditions at that time.
