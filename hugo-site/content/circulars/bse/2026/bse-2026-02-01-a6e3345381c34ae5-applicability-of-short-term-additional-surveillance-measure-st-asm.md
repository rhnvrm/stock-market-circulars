## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective February 02, 2026. Six securities are being newly shortlisted into the ST-ASM framework, one security (Vivimed Labs Ltd) continues in the framework but moves to a higher ASM stage, and three securities are exiting the ST-ASM framework. The circular also provides a consolidated list of all securities currently under the ST-ASM framework along with their respective stages.

## Key Points

- 6 securities newly entering Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework: Deep Diamond India Ltd, IB Infotech Enterprises Ltd, Integra Essentia Ltd, Manorama Industries Ltd, Systematix Corporate Services Ltd, and YAJUR FIBRES LIMITED
- Vivimed Labs Ltd continues in ST-ASM but moves to a higher stage
- 3 securities exiting ST-ASM Framework: Mirc Electronics Ltd, Orient Technologies Ltd, and Sofcom Systems Ltd

- Consolidated list includes 16+ securities across Stage I and Stage II ASM
- Framework includes both main board and SME scrips (marked with @)
- Some securities marked with (*) indicating alignment with NSE framework

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or volatility. Securities in this framework face stricter trading conditions including higher margin requirements and reduced position limits. The framework operates in stages (I, II, etc.) with progressively stringent measures as securities move to higher stages.

Securities can exit ST-ASM when moved to other surveillance frameworks including LT-ASM (Long Term ASM), Trade for Trade, GSM (Graded Surveillance Measure), Pledge Framework, or ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must apply appropriate margin requirements and position limits for securities in ST-ASM framework
- Members must ensure compliance with stage-specific trading restrictions
- Market participants should note the enhanced surveillance conditions for affected securities
- Updated framework parameters become applicable from market opening on February 02, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 02, 2026 - New ST-ASM classifications take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects trading conditions for specific securities with limited broader market impact.

**Operational Impact**: Securities entering ST-ASM will face:
- Higher margin requirements for traders
- Reduced position limits
- Potential impact on liquidity
- Increased trading costs

**Affected Securities**: 
- **Entering ST-ASM**: 6 securities face new surveillance measures
- **Moving to Higher Stage**: 1 security (Vivimed Labs) faces stricter conditions
- **Exiting ST-ASM**: 3 securities gain relief from short-term surveillance (though may be under other frameworks)

Traders and investors in these specific securities should review their positions and adjust strategies to account for the enhanced surveillance conditions and associated trading restrictions.
