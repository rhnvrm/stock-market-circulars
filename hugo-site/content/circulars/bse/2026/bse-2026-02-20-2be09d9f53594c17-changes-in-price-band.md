## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 20, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 23, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This circular directly impacts trading in 33 equity scrips. Scrips assigned narrower bands (2% or 5%) face tighter intraday price movement restrictions, likely due to heightened surveillance concerns such as volatility, illiquidity, or ongoing monitoring under ASM/GSM frameworks. Scrips assigned wider bands (20%) may be undergoing relaxation. Traders and investors holding or planning to trade these scrips should note the new limits to avoid order rejections from February 23, 2026.
