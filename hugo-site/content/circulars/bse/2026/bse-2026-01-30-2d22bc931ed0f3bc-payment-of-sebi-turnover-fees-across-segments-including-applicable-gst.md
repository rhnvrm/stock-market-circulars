## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Routine monthly payment requirement affecting all trading members across all segments. Members must maintain adequate liquidity in settlement accounts to avoid payment failures.

**Financial Impact**: Variable - Depends on individual member's trading turnover across segments. 18% GST increases total fee burden compared to pre-July 2022 period.

**Administrative Impact**: Low - Standard monthly process with established file formats and EXTRANET reporting mechanisms already in place.
