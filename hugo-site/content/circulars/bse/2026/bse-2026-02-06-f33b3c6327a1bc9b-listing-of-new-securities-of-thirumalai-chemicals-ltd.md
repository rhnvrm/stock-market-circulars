## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The preferential allotment increases Thirumalai Chemicals' equity base by approximately 18.97 lakh shares, representing capital infusion of Rs. 56.15 crore (18,96,614 shares × Rs. 296). Since these shares are issued to promoters and subject to lock-in until August 2027, there will be no immediate selling pressure or liquidity impact.

**Operational Impact**: Strengthens the company's capital base through promoter contribution at a significant premium to face value, indicating promoter confidence. The funds can be utilized for business expansion or operational requirements.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect, though the preferential allotment to promoters at premium pricing may be viewed positively as it demonstrates promoter commitment. The long lock-in period (until August 2027) ensures promoter alignment with long-term shareholder interests.
