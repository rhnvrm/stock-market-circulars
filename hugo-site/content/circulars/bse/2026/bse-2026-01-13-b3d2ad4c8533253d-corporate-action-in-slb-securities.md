## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects liquidity in SLB segment for six major securities during shut periods. Participants with open borrowing positions must plan for temporary suspension of lending/borrowing activity.

**Operational Impact:** SLB market makers and institutional participants need to adjust inventory and hedge positions ahead of shut periods. Dividend amounts will affect the economics of existing SLB transactions.

**Investor Impact:** Investors utilizing SLB for short selling or leverage must close or roll positions before shut periods. Failure to do so may result in forced buy-ins or settlement complications.
