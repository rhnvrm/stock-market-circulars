## Summary

BSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective January 23, 2026. Two new securities have been shortlisted into ESM Stage I, two securities will move to higher ESM stages, and no securities are exiting the framework. The consolidated list includes 29+ securities across different ESM stages (Stage I and Stage II).

## Key Points

- 2 new securities added to ESM Framework (Stage I): Glittek Granites Ltd and Mukat Pipes Ltd
- 2 securities moving to higher ESM stages: Starlineps Enterprises Ltd and Switching Technologies Gunther Ltd
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages
- No securities exiting ESM framework this cycle
- Consolidated list shows securities in ESM Stage I and Stage II
- Changes effective from January 23, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework continues to operate as designed, with securities being added, moved between stages, or removed based on surveillance criteria. Securities in ESM framework are subject to additional surveillance and typically trade in Trade-to-Trade (T2T) segment with stricter monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the securities under ESM framework
- Securities in ESM are subject to additional margin requirements
- Trades in ESM securities settle on T2T basis with delivery obligations
- Members must monitor client positions in ESM securities closely
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 23, 2026 - All ESM changes become effective

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities newly added to or moving to higher ESM stages face increased trading restrictions and surveillance, which typically reduces liquidity and increases price volatility. The T2T settlement requirement limits intraday trading activity.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance measures, potential reduced liquidity, and stricter settlement requirements. Higher ESM stages indicate elevated surveillance concerns.

**Market Impact**: Limited with only 2 new securities added. The continuing presence of 29+ securities in the consolidated ESM list indicates ongoing market surveillance activities by BSE.

## Securities Added to ESM (Stage I)

1. **Glittek Granites Ltd** (Scrip Code: 513528, ISIN: INE741B01027)
2. **Mukat Pipes Ltd** (Scrip Code: 523832, ISIN: INE862C01029)

## Securities Moving to Higher ESM Stages

- Aadi Industries Ltd (Stage II)
