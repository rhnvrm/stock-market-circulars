## Summary

BSE has scheduled a mock trading session for the Equity Derivatives segment on Saturday, January 10th, 2026. The session will run from 10:15 AM to 02:00 PM and includes testing of the new BOLT Pro TWS version 12.50. Additionally, BSE and NSE will test the interoperability mechanism mandated by SEBI, where an outage will be simulated at NSE and BSE will serve as the alternate trading venue for NSE exclusive securities. Trading members are encouraged to participate actively to test their trading applications and various functionalities including exceptional market conditions.

## Key Points
