## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The listing of 17,50,000 shares increases the total equity base of Indo Thai Securities Limited. The shares are subject to a lock-in period until August 15, 2026, which prevents immediate trading by allottees. The preferential allotment to Non-Promoters may provide additional liquidity to the stock once the lock-in expires. Overall market and operational impact is low.
