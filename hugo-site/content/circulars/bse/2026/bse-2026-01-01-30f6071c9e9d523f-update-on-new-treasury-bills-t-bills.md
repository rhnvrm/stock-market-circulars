## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The quarterly borrowing calendar provides transparency and helps market participants plan their liquidity and investment strategies. The total borrowing of ₹3,84,000 crore is distributed evenly across the quarter, which should help maintain stable market conditions.

**Liquidity Impact:** The balanced distribution between 91-day (₹1,44,000 crore) and 182-day (₹1,44,000 crore) T-Bills, with a smaller allocation to 364-day bills (₹96,000 crore), indicates a focus on short-term liquidity management. This aligns with typical government cash flow requirements.

**Operational Impact:** Low - This is a routine calendar release. Market participants including banks, primary dealers, and institutional investors can plan their participation in the auctions. The flexibility clause allows RBI to adjust based on evolving conditions, providing operational adaptability.
