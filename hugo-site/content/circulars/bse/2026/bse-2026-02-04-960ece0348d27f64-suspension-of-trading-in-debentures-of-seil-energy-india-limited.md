title: Suspension of Trading in Debentures of SEIL Energy India Limited
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in Non Convertible Debentures of SEIL Energy India Limited effective February 6, 2026. The suspension is due to the company exercising call option for early redemption of debentures and payment of interest, with the record date fixed as February 6, 2026. Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspended in 8.45%-SEIL-18-6-29-PVT debentures (ISIN: INE460M07010, Code: 975744)
- Suspension effective from February 6, 2026
- Purpose: Early redemption of debentures on exercise of call option and payment of interest
- Record date for both redemption and interest payment: February 6, 2026
- Trading members instructed not to deal in these debentures from suspension date
- Circular reference: DR-815/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard trading suspension procedure for corporate action execution related to debenture redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified SEIL Energy India Limited debentures from February 6, 2026
- Trading members must inform their clients holding these debentures about the trading suspension
- Market participants must comply with the no-dealing restriction immediately upon suspension

## Important Dates

- **February 4, 2026**: Circular issued by BSE
- **February 6, 2026**: Record date for early redemption and interest payment
- **February 6, 2026**: Trading suspension begins (no dealings from this date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High impact on debenture holders and debt market participants. The early redemption on call option exercise means debenture holders will receive principal repayment along with interest payment. Trading liquidity in these debentures is completely halted from the suspension date.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders whose names appear in the records as of February 6, 2026 will be eligible for early redemption proceeds and interest payment. Investors cannot trade these securities from the suspension date, eliminating any exit or entry opportunities in the secondary market.

**Operational Impact**: Trading desks and settlement systems must update their systems to block any trades in these debentures. Custodians and depositories need to prepare for redemption processing.
