---

## Summary

DSP Mutual Fund has announced the re-opening of subscriptions for DSP Credit Risk Fund effective January 01, 2026, after a temporary suspension that began on December 16, 2021. The scheme will resume accepting fresh purchases, additional purchases, and systematic transactions subject to a maximum investment cap of INR 10 crore per PAN and a revised exit load structure that significantly increases penalties for early redemptions.

## Key Points

- Subscriptions into DSP Credit Risk Fund were suspended since December 16, 2021
- Scheme re-opens for subscriptions from January 01, 2026
- Total investment value per PAN capped at INR 10 crore (including existing investments and fresh inflows)
- Exit load increased from 1% to 3% for redemptions within 12 months from allotment date
- Previous provision allowing 10% redemption without exit load has been removed
- No exit load for redemptions after 12 months from allotment date
- Changes apply to all prospective investments including SIPs, STPs registered on or after January 01, 2026
- Exemption applies to Designated Employees' mandatory investments under SEBI alignment of interest requirements
- No exit load for switches between Direct Plan and Regular Plan

## Regulatory Changes

**Exit Load Structure Changes:**

*Previous Structure:*
- Up to 10% redemption within 12 months: Nil exit load
- Excess of 10% redemption within 12 months: 1% exit load
- Redemptions after 12 months: Nil exit load

*Revised Structure (Effective January 01, 2026):*
- All redemptions within 12 months: 3% exit load
- Redemptions after 12 months: Nil exit load

**Investment Cap:**
- Maximum investment of INR 10 crore per PAN across existing and fresh investments
- Applies to all fresh purchases, additional purchases, Switch-ins, SIPs, and STP-ins

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors must ensure total holdings per PAN do not exceed INR 10 crore
- AMC will enforce the investment cap for all prospective subscriptions
- Unitholders should update PAN, KYC details, email address, mobile number, and nominee details with AMC
- Unitholders must link their PAN with Aadhaar Number
- Investors should review the Investor Charter on the Fund's website
- Check for any unclaimed redemptions or IDCW payments
- SID and KIM of the scheme have been amended to reflect these changes

## Important Dates

- **December 16, 2021**: Original suspension of subscriptions began
- **December 26, 2025**: Notice date for scheme re-opening
- **January 01, 2026**: Effective date for resumption of subscriptions and implementation of new exit load structure

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact:**
- Existing investors can now make additional investments subject to the INR 10 crore cap
- Significant deterrent for early exits with 3% exit load (tripled from 1%)
- Removal of the 10% free redemption window increases cost for investors needing liquidity within 12 months
- High net worth investors may be restricted by the INR 10 crore cap per PAN

**Scheme Impact:**
- Investment cap helps AMC manage fund size and liquidity
- Higher exit load promotes long-term investment behavior and reduces redemption pressure
- Likely to improve portfolio stability and reduce forced selling of illiquid credit instruments

**Market Impact:**
- Limited broader market impact as changes are scheme-specific
- Sets precedent for other credit risk funds managing liquidity concerns
- Reflects ongoing challenges in credit risk fund category post-2020 credit events
