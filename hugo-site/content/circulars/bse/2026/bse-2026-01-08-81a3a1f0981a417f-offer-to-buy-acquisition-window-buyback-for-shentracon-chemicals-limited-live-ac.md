## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Limited to shareholders of SHENTRACON CHEMICALS LIMITED. The buyback represents a significant number of shares (1.65 crore) but at a very low offer price of Rs. 0.50 per share, indicating a micro-cap or distressed situation.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and custodians need to ensure technical readiness for the OTB module through iBBS and RTRMS platforms. The 10-day window provides adequate time for eligible shareholders to participate.

**Shareholder Impact:** Provides exit opportunity for shareholders at Rs. 0.50 per share. The low offer price relative to face value (Rs. 10.00) suggests significant discount, which shareholders should evaluate carefully.
