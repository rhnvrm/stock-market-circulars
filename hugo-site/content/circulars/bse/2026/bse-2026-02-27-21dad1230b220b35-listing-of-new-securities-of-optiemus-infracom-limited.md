## Impact Assessment

The listing of 7,866 shares is a very small addition to Optiemus Infracom Limited's share capital and is unlikely to have any material impact on the stock's price or liquidity. All newly listed shares are under lock-in until September 10, 2026, further limiting any near-term supply-side pressure. This is a routine corporate action following warrant conversion by non-promoter investors.
