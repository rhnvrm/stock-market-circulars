- SEBI Act, 1992: Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11(4A), 11B(1) and 11B(2)
- SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003
- SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995, Rule 5

## Compliance Requirements

The 27 noticees are subject to penalties and restrictions as determined under the SEBI enforcement order. Market participants should:
- Avoid coordinated trading activities that artificially manipulate stock prices and volumes
- Ensure trading activities comply with PFUTP regulations
- Maintain independent trading decisions without group coordination
- Be aware that connections through shared devices, IPs, mobile numbers, and fund flows can establish coordinated group activity

## Important Dates

- **August 26, 2021**: DU Digital listed on NSE SME platform at Rs. 12/share
- **August 26, 2021 to March 31, 2023**: Investigation Period
- **November 11, 2022**: Stock reached peak price of Rs. 296.05 (2467% increase from listing)
- **March 31, 2023**: End of investigation period, closing price Rs. 179.10
- **2026-01-01**: Order issued by SEBI

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This enforcement action demonstrates SEBI's continued focus on detecting and penalizing coordinated manipulation schemes, particularly in SME segment stocks which are more susceptible to price manipulation due to lower liquidity. The 2467% price increase achieved through coordinated group activities severely distorted price discovery and harmed genuine investors.

**Investor Impact**: Retail investors who purchased DU Digital shares during the artificially inflated price periods likely suffered significant losses when the manipulation ceased. The order serves as a warning about elevated risks in SME platform stocks.

**Regulatory Impact**: Reinforces SEBI's capability to identify connected entities through technological footprints (common IPs, MAC IDs, mobile numbers) and financial trails (fund flows). Establishes precedent for group liability in coordinated manipulation cases.

**Broker Impact**: Inclusion of Sun Flower Broking Private Limited as Noticee No. 27 highlights broker accountability for facilitating suspicious trading activities and underscores the need for enhanced surveillance and client due diligence.

**SME Platform Impact**: Raises concerns about manipulation vulnerabilities in SME segment and may lead to enhanced surveillance measures for newly listed SME stocks experiencing abnormal price movements.
