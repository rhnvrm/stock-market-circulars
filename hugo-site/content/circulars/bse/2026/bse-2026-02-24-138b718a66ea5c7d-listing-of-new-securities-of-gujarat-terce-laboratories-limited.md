## Impact Assessment

The addition of 3,71,000 shares represents a minor increase in the total share capital of Gujarat Terce Laboratories Limited. Since the shares are allotted to promoters and are locked in until June 2027, there is no immediate dilution impact or additional free-float in the near term. Market impact is minimal and confined to the specific scrip (BSE: 524314). Retail investors and trading members should note the lock-in restriction to avoid any settlement issues involving these specific distribution numbers.
