title: Fractal Industries Limited Equity Shares Transfer from MT Group to M Group
  (Rolling Segment)
---

## Summary

BSE has announced that the equity shares of Fractal Industries Limited (SME IPO, Scrip Code: 544707) will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to the Rolling segment under M Group, effective Wednesday, March 11, 2026. This is a continuation of the earlier notice dated February 23, 2026 (Notice No. 20260223-23).

## Key Points

- Equity shares of Fractal Industries Limited (Scrip Code: 544707) will move from Trade for Trade (MT Group) to Rolling segment (M Group)
- Transition is effective from Wednesday, March 11, 2026
- This circular is a continuation of Notice No. 20260223-23 dated February 23, 2026
- Issued under the SME segment of BSE
- Trading Members may contact Mr. Anurag Jain at 022-2272-8822 for further details

## Regulatory Changes

The stock will no longer be traded under the Trade for Trade mechanism (MT Group), where each trade must result in delivery and no netting of positions is allowed. Post-transition, the stock will trade under the Rolling settlement mechanism (M Group), enabling normal buy-sell netting and standard T+1/T+2 settlement cycles applicable to SME segment stocks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must note the segment change effective March 11, 2026
- All orders and positions must account for the new settlement mechanism under M Group from the effective date
- Members should update their systems and client communications to reflect the change from Trade for Trade to Rolling settlement

## Important Dates

- **February 23, 2026**: Initial notice (Notice No. 20260223-23) issued
- **February 24, 2026**: This follow-up circular issued
- **March 11, 2026 (Wednesday)**: Effective date of transfer from MT Group to M Group (Rolling segment)

## Impact Assessment

This is a standard post-SME-IPO transition that typically occurs after the mandatory Trade for Trade period concludes. The move to Rolling segment (M Group) increases liquidity and trading flexibility for Fractal Industries Limited shares, as traders will be able to net positions and are no longer required to deliver for every trade. This transition is generally positive for the stock's marketability. Existing shareholders and active traders in this scrip should be aware of the changed settlement dynamics from March 11, 2026.
