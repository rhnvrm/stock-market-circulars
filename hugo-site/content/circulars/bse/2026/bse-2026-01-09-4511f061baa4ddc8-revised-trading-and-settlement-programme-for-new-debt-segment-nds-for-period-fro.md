- Auction pay-in deadline: 9:30 a.m. (members must submit instructions by 9:20 a.m.)

- **Settlement Holiday**: January 15, 2026 (no settlement cycle NDS-194)
- **First Settlement**: NDS-184/25-26 (Trading: Jan 1, Pay-out: Jan 2)
- **Last Settlement in Period**: NDS-204/25-26 (Trading: Jan 30, Pay-out: Feb 2)
- **Republic Day Impact**: Settlement NDS-199 trading on Jan 22 has extended pay-out to Jan 27

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine administrative circular providing the standard monthly settlement calendar.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Members trading in the New Debt Segment need to note the revised schedule and ensure timely submission of pay-in instructions. The settlement holiday on January 15 and Republic Day on January 26 create slightly extended settlement cycles that members should plan for.

**Stakeholder Impact**: Affects NDS trading members, clearing corporation, and depositories who need to coordinate settlement activities according to the published schedule.
