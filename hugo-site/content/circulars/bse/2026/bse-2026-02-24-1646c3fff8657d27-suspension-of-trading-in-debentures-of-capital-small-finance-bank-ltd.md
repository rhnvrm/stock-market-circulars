Trading members are instructed not to deal in the specified debenture series from the record date onwards.

- The debenture series affected: **CSFBL-11.75%-30-3-30-PVT** (ISIN: INE646H08012, Scrip Code: 951995).
- Purpose of record date: **Early Redemption of Debentures and Payment of Interest**.
- No dealings in these debentures are permitted from **March 9, 2026**.
- Notice reference: DR-835/2025-2026.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard operational notice under existing BSE listing compliance procedures for debt instruments.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must **cease all dealings** in CSFBL-11.75%-30-3-30-PVT (ISIN: INE646H08012, Scrip Code: 951995) from March 9, 2026.

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and traders of the specific NCD series (ISIN: INE646H08012) of Capital Small Finance Bank Ltd. The early redemption will return principal to debenture holders along with accrued interest, effectively retiring this series. Market impact is low as this is a privately placed instrument in the debt segment with a narrow investor base.
