## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 109 securities with varying liquidity profiles. While most quantities are relatively small, some securities like Sunshine Capital have extremely large pending quantities which could impact price discovery during the auction.

**Operational Impact:** Affects trading members and their clients who have pending delivery obligations. Members must arrange for securities or funds to fulfill auction obligations, which may require immediate liquidity management.

**Investor Impact:** Clients with short delivery positions will face auction consequences including potential price penalties and additional costs. The wide range of affected securities suggests scattered delivery failures across the market rather than systemic issues.
