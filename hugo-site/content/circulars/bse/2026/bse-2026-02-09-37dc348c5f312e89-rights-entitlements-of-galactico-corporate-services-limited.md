## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must inform all clients about commencement of REs trading
- Trading Members must mention the ISIN of the RE in client communications
- Trading Members must clarify that REs are not ordinary shares
- Contract notes/bills must include prominent disclaimer stating:
  - Purchase of REs only gives right to participate in Rights Issue by making application with requisite money OR renounce REs before issue closes
  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced before Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished
- Trading Members must refer to notice 20200305-21 and 20200518-34 for additional details

## Important Dates

- **February 9, 2026**: Circular issue date

- **February 17, 2026**: REs trading for renunciation ends
- **February 23, 2026**: Rights Issue closes

## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market-wide impact as it pertains to a single company's rights issue. Impact is confined to:

- Existing shareholders of Galactico Corporate Services Limited who receive Rights Entitlements
- Trading Members handling transactions for these shareholders
- Investors interested in participating in the rights issue

The short 5-day renunciation trading window (Feb 11-17) requires shareholders to act quickly if they wish to renounce their rights. REs that remain unsubscribed and unrenounced will be extinguished after February 23, 2026, representing a permanent loss of value for inactive shareholders.
