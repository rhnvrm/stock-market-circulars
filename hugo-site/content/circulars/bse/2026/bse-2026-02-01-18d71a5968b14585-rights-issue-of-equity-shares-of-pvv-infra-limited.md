## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Shareholders**: Existing shareholders as of the record date will be eligible to subscribe to the rights issue at par value. The rights entitlement ratio of 6:7 means shareholders can increase their holdings proportionally.

**Impact on Trading**: From February 5, 2026, all trading will be on ex-rights basis, meaning new buyers will not be entitled to participate in the rights issue. This may impact short-term price movements.

**Payment Terms**: The staggered payment structure (25% on application, 75% on call) provides flexibility to shareholders while reducing immediate capital outlay requirements.
