title: Scrips Not Available for T+0 Rolling Settlement on March 30, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has notified trading members via Notice No. 20260224-23 that 20 scrips will not be available for trading in the T+0 (same-day) rolling settlement cycle on Monday, March 30, 2026. These scrips will remain available under the standard T+1 or T+2 settlement cycles; only the T+0 settlement option is suspended for these securities on that specific date.

## Key Points

- 20 equity scrips are excluded from the T+0 rolling settlement cycle exclusively on March 30, 2026.
- The restriction applies only to the T+0 settlement segment; normal trading under other settlement cycles is not affected.
- The affected scrips include large financial institutions, insurance companies, and prominent listed companies across multiple sectors.
- Notice issued under the Equity segment by BSE's Trading Operations division.

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory change is introduced. This is a temporary, date-specific operational restriction on the T+0 rolling settlement segment for the listed scrips.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure that orders for the 20 listed scrips are not placed in the T+0 rolling settlement segment on March 30, 2026.
- Members should inform their clients accordingly and route trades through the applicable T+1/T+2 settlement cycles for these scrips on that date.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** March 30, 2026 (Monday) — T+0 settlement unavailable for listed scrips.
- **Circular Date:** February 24, 2026.

## Impact Assessment

The restriction affects 20 well-known scrips spanning banking, insurance, pharma, technology, and consumer sectors, including Union Bank of India, Coforge, AU Small Finance Bank, Fortis Healthcare, Godrej Properties, HDFC AMC, ICICI Lombard, ICICI Prudential, LIC, Mankind Pharma, Swiggy, and others. Traders and institutional participants who rely on same-day settlement for liquidity management or intraday strategies will need to adjust their plans for these scrips on March 30, 2026. The impact is confined to a single trading session and does not affect the broader availability or listing status of these securities.
