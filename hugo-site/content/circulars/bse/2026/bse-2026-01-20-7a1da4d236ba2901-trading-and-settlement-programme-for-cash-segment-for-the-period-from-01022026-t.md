## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - All brokers, custodians, clearing members, and market participants must align their operational calendars, settlement workflows, and fund/securities management systems with this schedule. The calendar is essential for planning liquidity requirements and settlement obligations.

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine operational calendar that follows established settlement cycles. No disruption to normal trading activities expected.

**Participant Impact:** All cash segment participants including brokers, institutional investors, custodians, and clearing corporations must ensure their systems and processes are configured according to this settlement schedule. Special attention required for the February 19 trading date which settles on February 20 (marked with @), and the subsequent catch-up settlements.

**System Requirements:** Participants must ensure their back-office systems, depository interfaces, and settlement modules are updated with the correct settlement numbers and dates to avoid settlement failures or delayed processing.
