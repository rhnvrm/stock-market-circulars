## Impact Assessment

**Affected Instruments:**

| Scrip Name | ISIN | BSE Code | Reduced Face Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| SCL-9.65%-23-3-28-NCD | INE148I07NW6 | 938484 | Rs. 400 |
| SCL-10.15%-23-3-28-NCD | INE148I07OH5 | 938486 | Rs. 400 |
| SCL-9.25%-23-3-28-NCD | INE148I07NX4 | 938488 | Rs. 400 |
| SCL-9.71%-23-3-28-NCD | INE148I07NV8 | 938490 | Rs. 400 |

This is a routine partial redemption event. Impact is limited to investors and trading members holding these four specific NCD series. The reduced face value reflects the principal component being repaid, and trading post-record date will reflect the lower face value. All four series share the same maturity date (23 March 2028) and follow identical redemption terms.
