## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - This call payment affects a substantial number of partly paid-up shares (13.85 crore shares) of Adani Enterprises Limited, requiring significant capital deployment from shareholders. The call amount of Rs. 450 per share represents a material financial obligation.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and SCSBs must ensure their IBBS systems are operational and staff are prepared to process call money collections during the 15-day window. The concentrated timeframe requires efficient coordination between intermediaries, the registrar (MUFG Intime India Private Limited), and shareholders.

**Shareholder Impact:** Shareholders must arrange funds for the call payment or risk forfeiture of their partly paid-up shares. This is particularly significant given the per-share call amount and the total number of shares involved.
