## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. This is a standard preferential allotment listing representing approximately 10.76 lakh shares. The shares are subject to lock-in restrictions limiting immediate liquidity impact. The promoter shares have a longer lock-in period (until July 2027) compared to non-promoter shares (until July 2026), which is consistent with SEBI regulations for preferential allotments. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and new distinctive numbers.
