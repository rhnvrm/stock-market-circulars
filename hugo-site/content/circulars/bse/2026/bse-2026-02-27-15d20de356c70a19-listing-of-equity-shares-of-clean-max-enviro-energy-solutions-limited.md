## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular is a compliance disclosure under SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018, specifically Regulation 17(c), which mandates lock-in of AIF-held shares as of the Prospectus date (February 25, 2026).

## Compliance Requirements

- The company has disclosed all lock-in details as required under SEBI ICDR Regulations
- Depositories and registrars must enforce lock-in restrictions on the specified share tranches
- Further details on lock-in are available on pages 148–152 of the Company's Prospectus
- Annexure 1 provides AIF shareholder details; Annexure 2 provides ESOP beneficiary details

## Important Dates

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| February 25, 2026 | Prospectus date (reference date for lock-in determination) |
| February 26, 2026 | Listing date; lock-in period commencement |
| March 27, 2026 | Anchor investor lock-in expiry (first tranche: 4,373,218 shares) |
| May 26, 2026 | Anchor investor lock-in expiry (second tranche: 4,373,219 shares) |
| August 5, 2026 | AIF lock-in expiry (4,368,471 shares) |
| August 26, 2026 | Lock-in expiry for select tranches |
| February 26, 2027 | Lock-in expiry for select tranches |
| February 26, 2029 | Lock-in expiry for longest-duration tranches |

## Impact Assessment

The staggered lock-in schedule means that a significant portion of total shares will remain restricted from trading for up to 3 years, limiting immediate selling pressure from promoters and pre-IPO investors. The earliest meaningful unlock occurs for anchor investors beginning March 27, 2026 (30 days post-listing). IPO public allottees and ESOP shares (approximately 14.9M + 1.4M shares) are freely tradable from listing. Investors should monitor unlock dates—particularly February 26, 2027 and February 26, 2029—as potential liquidity events that may exert downward price pressure.
