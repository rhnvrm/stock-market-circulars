- **January 13, 2026**: Record date for interest payment and redemption
- **January 13, 2026**: Trading suspension effective date (no dealings allowed from this date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Complete trading suspension affects liquidity for existing debenture holders who cannot exit positions through secondary market from January 13, 2026 onwards.

**Investor Impact**: High - Debenture holders must note that no trading opportunity will be available from the suspension date. Only option is redemption on maturity or holding until further notice.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members need to update systems and communicate with clients holding these debentures. The 8.70% coupon rate debentures are reaching their maturity event, requiring operational preparedness for interest payment and principal redemption processing.

**Financial Impact**: The redemption event indicates capital will be returned to debenture holders along with final interest payment, requiring liquidity management by the issuer.
