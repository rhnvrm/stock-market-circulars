## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification following preferential allotment procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note:
- New shares are available for trading from January 2, 2026
- Lock-in restrictions apply to the allotted shares (see Important Dates section)
- Shares to be traded under existing scrip code 500184

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date:** November 7, 2025
- **Trading Commencement:** January 2, 2026
- **Lock-in Period:**
  - 1,00,00,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 494477751 - 504477750): Locked until July 16, 2027
  - 17,200 shares (Dist. Nos. 504477751 - 504494950): Locked until July 16, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to minimal. The listing represents approximately 10 million new shares from warrant conversion with majority (1 crore shares) locked in until July 2027 and remaining 17,200 shares locked until July 2026. The lock-in restrictions significantly limit immediate liquidity impact. The preferential allotment to promoters and non-promoters suggests strategic capital raising rather than broad market distribution. Trading members should note the additional shares in circulation but expect limited near-term trading impact due to lock-in constraints.
