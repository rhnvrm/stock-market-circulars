- Renunciation trading window: February 27, 2026 to March 5, 2026
- Rights Issue open period: February 27, 2026 to March 10, 2026
- Scrip Code: 751091 | Scrip ID: SADHNA-RE | ISIN: INE888C20024

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform all clients about the commencement of RE trading, including the ISIN, and clarify that REs are not ordinary shares of the company
- Contract notes and bills for RE purchases must prominently include a disclaimer stating that purchase of REs only entitles the holder to participate in the ongoing Rights Issue or renounce the REs before issue closure
- Members must ensure clients understand that unsubscribed/unrenounced REs will lapse after the Issue Closing Date

## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Trading in REs commences | February 27, 2026 (Friday) |
| Rights Issue opens | February 27, 2026 |
| Last day for RE renunciation trading | March 5, 2026 (Thursday) |
| Rights Issue closes | March 10, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a moderate and targeted impact, primarily affecting existing shareholders of Sadhana Nitro Chem Limited and traders interested in participating in or renouncing the rights issue. The T+1 trade-for-trade settlement reduces counterparty risk. Shareholders who do not act before March 10, 2026 risk their REs lapsing with no recovery of value, making timely action important for affected parties.
