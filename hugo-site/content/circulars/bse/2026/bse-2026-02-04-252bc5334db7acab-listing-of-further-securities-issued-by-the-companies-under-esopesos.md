## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. These are routine ESOP/ESOS allotments representing a small percentage of each company's total outstanding shares. The largest issuance is ICICI Bank with 348,380 shares (face value ₹2), which is negligible compared to its overall market capitalization.

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal. With no lock-in period, these shares are immediately tradable, but the quantities are too small to significantly affect market liquidity.

**Sector Distribution:** The listing primarily affects financial services (banking, payment services, broking), industrial (Kirloskar Ferrous), technology (Quick Heal), and chemical (Viyash Scientific) sectors.
