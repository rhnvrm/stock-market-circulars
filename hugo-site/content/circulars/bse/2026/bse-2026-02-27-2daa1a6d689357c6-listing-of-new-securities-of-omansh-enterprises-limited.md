These shares were allotted pursuant to the conversion of 25,00,000 (Twenty Five Lakh) 0% Unlisted Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS) into equity shares under the Resolution Plan approved by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), New Delhi Bench.

## Key Points

- 1,25,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 2/- face value each are now listed on BSE.
- Shares were allotted on June 06, 2025, pursuant to conversion of 25,00,000 0% Unlisted CCPS into equity.
- Conversion was sanctioned under the NCLT (New Delhi Bench) Resolution Plan order dated February 29, 2024.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. The listing is consequential to an NCLT Resolution Plan approval and standard CCPS-to-equity conversion mechanics.

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** June 06, 2025

- **Lock-in Expiry:** April 30, 2027
- **NCLT Resolution Plan Order Date:** February 29, 2024

## Impact Assessment

The listing increases the total tradeable equity of Omansh Enterprises Limited. However, since all newly listed shares are under lock-in until April 30, 2027, there is no immediate increase in free-float or liquidity. The impact is limited to the company and its existing shareholders; broader market impact is negligible. Investors holding or considering positions in Omansh Enterprises (538537) should be aware of the expanded share capital and the lock-in overhang that will unwind in April 2027.
