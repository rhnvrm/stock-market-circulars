title: Revision in Eligibility Criteria for Direct Listing on BSE Main Board
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the eligibility criteria applicable to SME companies seeking migration to the Main Board and to companies listed on other recognized stock exchanges seeking direct listing on the BSE Main Board. The revised framework specifies minimum thresholds across paid-up capital, market capitalisation, market liquidity, operating profit, net worth, net tangible assets, promoter holding, and lock-in requirements.

## Key Points

- Minimum paid-up capital of at least Rs. 10 crores required
- Direct listing requires average 6-month market capitalisation of Rs. 1,000 crores; SME migration requires Rs. 100 crores
- Alternative to market cap criterion: revenue from operations of Rs. 100 crores or more for each of the preceding 3 full financial years
- Market liquidity criteria include: at least 5% of weighted average equity shares traded in 6 months, trading on at least 80% of days, minimum average daily turnover of Rs. 10 lakhs, minimum daily turnover of Rs. 5 lakhs, minimum average 50 daily trades, and minimum 25 daily trades
- Operating profit (EBITDA) average of Rs. 15 crores on restated consolidated basis over preceding 3 years, with minimum Rs. 10 crores in each year
- Net worth of at least Rs. 1 crore in each of the preceding 3 full years
- Net tangible assets of at least Rs. 3 crores on restated consolidated basis in each of the preceding 3 full years, with not more than 50% held in monetary assets
- Minimum promoter holding of at least 20% at the time of application
- Lock-in of promoter/promoter group shares for 6 months from the date of BSE listing

## Regulatory Changes

BSE has revised and consolidated the eligibility framework for:
1. SME companies migrating from the SME platform to the Main Board
2. Companies already listed on other recognized stock exchanges seeking direct listing on BSE Main Board

Key structural change: a dual-track approach is introduced for market capitalisation and market liquidity criteria, allowing companies with revenue from operations of Rs. 100 crores or more for each of the preceding 3 full financial years to qualify as an alternative route.

For net tangible assets: if more than 50% are held in monetary assets, the company must have utilised or made firm commitments to utilise such excess monetary assets in its business or project.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must meet minimum paid-up capital of Rs. 10 crores
- Must satisfy either the market capitalisation threshold or the revenue-from-operations alternative
- Must satisfy either the market liquidity criteria or the revenue-from-operations alternative
- Must demonstrate average EBITDA of Rs. 15 crores over 3 years with no single year below Rs. 10 crores
- Must maintain net worth of Rs. 1 crore and net tangible assets of Rs. 3 crores in each of the preceding 3 full years
- Promoter holding must be at least 20% at the time of application (promoter group shareholding may be considered for any shortfall)
- Promoter and promoter group shares are subject to a 6-month lock-in from BSE listing date
- In case of name change within the last one year, at least 50% of revenue for the preceding full year must be earned from the activity indicated by the new name

## Important Dates

- Circular date: 23 February 2026
- Effective date: Not explicitly stated in the extracted content; companies applying for migration or direct listing after this date will be subject to the revised criteria

## Impact Assessment

**SME companies:** Companies currently on BSE SME or NSE Emerge platforms planning to migrate to the Main Board must benchmark themselves against these revised thresholds. The Rs. 100 crore market cap requirement and EBITDA floor of Rs. 10 crores per year will be gatekeeping criteria for smaller issuers.

**Companies on regional/other exchanges:** Companies listed on other recognized stock exchanges seeking direct BSE Main Board listing face a significantly higher bar with the Rs. 1,000 crore average market capitalisation requirement, unless they qualify via the revenue alternative route.

**Promoter impact:** The 20% minimum promoter holding and 6-month post-listing lock-in requirement impose governance and liquidity constraints on promoters of migrating/directly listing companies, though exemptions apply for diversified-holding companies with no identifiable promoters already listed on exchanges with nationwide terminals.

**Market integrity:** The liquidity criteria (80% trading days, minimum daily turnover, minimum daily trades) are designed to ensure that only genuinely liquid securities with established price discovery access the Main Board.
