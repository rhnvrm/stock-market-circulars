## Impact Assessment

This circular has a medium impact on participants in the debt market segment. Existing bondholders of RRVPN's 8.69% bond (maturing 23-Mar-2027) will receive partial principal repayment along with interest on the record date. Post-redemption, the face value per bond reduces to Rs.4,00,000, which will lower the traded value and interest accruals on the remaining principal for subsequent periods. Trading members and custodians must ensure accurate settlement and updated face value in their systems from 06/03/2026 to avoid trade discrepancies.
