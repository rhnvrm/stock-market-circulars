## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective February 05, 2026. The circular includes one new security being added to LT-ASM (CWD Ltd), one security moving to a higher ASM stage (Mizzen Ventures Ltd moving to Stage II), two securities exiting the framework (Dev Labtech Venture Ltd and Dhanashree Electronics Ltd), and provides a consolidated list of all securities currently under various ASM stages.

## Key Points

- CWD Ltd (Scrip Code: 543378, ISIN: INE0H8H01019) newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework
- Mizzen Ventures Ltd (Scrip Code: 531537) moving from current stage to ASM Stage II
- Dev Labtech Venture Ltd and Dhanashree Electronics Ltd moving out of LT-ASM Framework
- No securities moving to lower ASM stages
- No securities being placed directly in Stage IV
- Consolidated list includes 19+ securities across different ASM stages (I, II, IV)
- Securities may exit LT-ASM due to inclusion in Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, or IBC frameworks

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework continues to operate as per existing guidelines. Securities under LT-ASM are subject to enhanced surveillance and additional trading restrictions based on their stage classification. The framework uses multiple stages (I, II, IV) with progressively stricter surveillance measures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of securities under LT-ASM and associated trading restrictions
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in securities under ASM stages
- Different margin and settlement requirements may apply based on ASM stage
- Investors should exercise caution when trading securities under surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 05, 2026 - All changes to LT-ASM classifications become effective

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The changes affect liquidity and trading conditions for the impacted securities. New additions and stage upgrades typically result in reduced trading activity due to enhanced restrictions.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and risk management frameworks to reflect the new ASM classifications. Securities moving to higher stages face stricter surveillance including potential Price-to-Price (PTP) delivery-based settlement and additional margin requirements.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance measures which may include trading restrictions, increased margins, and reduced liquidity. Exit from LT-ASM (as seen with Dev Labtech and Dhanashree Electronics) may indicate these securities are now under other restrictive frameworks.
