## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects liquidity in SLB segment for 17 actively traded securities across diverse sectors including large-cap stocks like BPCL, GAIL, Power Grid, and MRF.

**Operational Impact**: SLB participants must ensure timely closure or rollover of positions before shut periods begin. Failure to do so may result in forced position maintenance through the dividend record date, potentially affecting settlement obligations and margin requirements.

**Investor Considerations**: Institutional investors and market makers utilizing SLB facilities should review their positions in these securities and plan foreclosure activities outside the restricted periods to avoid operational disruptions.
