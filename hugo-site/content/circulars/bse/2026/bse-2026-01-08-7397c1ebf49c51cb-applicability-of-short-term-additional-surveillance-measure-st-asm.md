## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities showing unusual price movements or high volatility. Securities under this framework face enhanced surveillance measures including:

- Specific margin requirements
- Trading restrictions
- Enhanced monitoring by exchange

Securities are classified with special markers:
- (*) - Also listed on NSE or moving to LT-ASM
- ($) - Moving to ESM Framework
- (@) - SME scrips
- (~) - T+0 scrips

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised surveillance classifications
- Trading members should update their systems for the new ST-ASM applicability
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance measures on these securities
- Different margin and settlement requirements may apply to securities under surveillance

## Important Dates

**Effective Date:** January 09, 2026
- All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Securities newly added to ST-ASM may experience reduced liquidity due to enhanced surveillance
- Higher margin requirements may deter short-term speculative trading
- Securities moving out to other frameworks (ESM, LT-ASM) face continued or stricter surveillance

**Investor Impact:**
- Investors holding securities in ST-ASM framework should expect potential volatility
- Enhanced margin requirements increase capital requirements for trading these securities
- Long-term investors may face settlement restrictions depending on surveillance stage

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers must update surveillance classifications in trading systems
- Risk management systems need recalibration for affected securities
- Enhanced due diligence required for client orders in these securities
