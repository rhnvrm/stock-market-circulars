## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities and may facilitate trades from February 26, 2026 onwards.
- The lock-in restriction must be observed: all 4,477,612 shares (Dist. Nos. 227474208 to 231951819) are locked in until **August 30, 2026** and cannot be traded until that date.

## Important Dates

| Event | Date |

| Date of Allotment | January 29, 2026 |
| Trading Permitted From | February 26, 2026 |
| Lock-in Expiry | August 30, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 4,477,612 new equity shares to the tradeable float of Suven Life Sciences Ltd, representing a modest dilution for existing shareholders. However, since all newly listed shares are subject to a lock-in until August 30, 2026, there is no immediate increase in freely tradeable supply. The impact on market price and liquidity is expected to be low in the short term due to the lock-in constraint. Post lock-in expiry, the release of these shares into the market could result in mild selling pressure depending on market conditions at that time.
