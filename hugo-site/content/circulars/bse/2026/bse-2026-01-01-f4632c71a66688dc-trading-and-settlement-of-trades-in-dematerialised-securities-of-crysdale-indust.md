**Operational Impact:**
- Medium impact on trading members who need to update their systems for the new ISIN and revised market lot
- Transition from market lot of 100 to 1 share increases accessibility for smaller investors
- Trade to Trade segment classification with no netting increases settlement obligations

**Market Impact:**
- Currently limited as trading is under suspension
- Upon revocation, the reduced market lot (from 100 to 1) will lower entry barriers for retail investors
- Direct close-out of shortages increases delivery risk and may discourage speculative trading

**Investor Impact:**
- Positive for retail investors due to lower market lot, making the scrip more affordable
- All shareholders must hold shares in demat form for trading
- Trade to Trade segment and no netting requirement indicates enhanced surveillance
