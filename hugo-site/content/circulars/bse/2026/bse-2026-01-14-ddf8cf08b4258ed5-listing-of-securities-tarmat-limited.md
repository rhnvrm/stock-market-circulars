## Summary

BSE has approved the listing of 1,000,000 equity shares of Tarmat Limited (Scrip Code: 532869) issued on a preferential basis to non-promoters pursuant to conversion of warrants. The shares will be available for trading from Friday, January 16, 2026. The shares were issued at Rs. 95/- per share (face value Rs. 10/- plus premium of Rs. 85/-) and are subject to lock-in until July 30, 2026.

## Key Points

- 1,000,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each issued at a premium of Rs. 85/-
- Issue price: Rs. 95/- per share
- Allotted to non-promoters on preferential basis via warrant conversion

- Trading commencement: January 16, 2026
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares
- ISIN: INE924H01018
- Distinctive numbers: 24064256 to 25064255
- All shares under lock-in until July 30, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine listing notification following SEBI guidelines for preferential allotment and warrant conversion.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the new securities for Tarmat Limited
- Lock-in restrictions apply to all 1,000,000 shares until July 30, 2026
- Shares cannot be transferred or traded by allottees during the lock-in period

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: October 23, 2025
- **Trading Start Date**: January 16, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry**: July 30, 2026
- **Notice Date**: January 14, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of preferential shares for a single company. The 1 million shares represent a capital infusion of Rs. 9.5 crores for Tarmat Limited. The lock-in period until July 30, 2026 means these shares will not immediately impact trading volumes or liquidity. The warrant conversion indicates fulfillment of prior funding commitments by non-promoter investors, which is positive for the company's capital structure but has minimal broader market implications.
