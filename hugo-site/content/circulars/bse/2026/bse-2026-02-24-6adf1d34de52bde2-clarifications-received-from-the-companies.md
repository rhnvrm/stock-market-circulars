  Hind Rectifiers
---

## Summary

BSE Surveillance sought clarifications from two listed companies regarding significant increases in trading volume. BLS International Services Ltd. (BSE: 540073) responded that it is unaware of any reason for the volume surge and has not withheld any material information. Hind Rectifiers Ltd. (BSE: 504036) attributed the increased trading volume to its proposed bonus issue, confirming all related disclosures have been duly made to stock exchanges.

## Key Points

- **BLS International Services Ltd. (BSE: 540073):** Received BSE surveillance query (ref. L/SURV/ONL/PV/SG/2025-26/929) on February 24, 2026 regarding abnormal volume increase.
- BLS International states no material information or event has been withheld from stock exchanges under Regulation 30 of SEBI LODR Regulations.
- BLS International is unable to identify a specific reason for the volume increase and reiterates its commitment to timely and transparent disclosures.
- **Hind Rectifiers Ltd. (BSE: 504036):** Received NSE surveillance query (ref. NSE/CM/Surveillance/16496) on February 23, 2026 regarding volume movement.
- Hind Rectifiers confirms the volume increase is attributable to its proposed bonus issue announcement.
- All disclosures related to the bonus issue have been made, including: board meeting intimation, board meeting outcome approving the bonus issue, and a postal ballot notice seeking member approval.

No regulatory changes introduced. Both responses are routine compliance communications under Regulation 30 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- Both companies reaffirm ongoing compliance with Regulation 30 of SEBI LODR Regulations, requiring prompt disclosure of all material events and price-sensitive information.

## Impact Assessment

These are routine surveillance responses with no direct market or operational impact. BLS International's response is inconclusive regarding the cause of volume movement, which may maintain investor uncertainty. Hind Rectifiers provides a clear and credible explanation linking volume activity to its ongoing bonus issue process, which is generally viewed positively by the market. Neither response introduces new information materially affecting valuations or trading conditions beyond what was previously disclosed.
