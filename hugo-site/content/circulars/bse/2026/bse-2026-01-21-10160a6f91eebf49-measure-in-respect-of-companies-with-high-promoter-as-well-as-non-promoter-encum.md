This circular implements surveillance measures under SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulation 2011, specifically Regulation 28(3) which deals with encumbrance of shares. The framework is designed to monitor companies where high levels of promoter and non-promoter shareholding are pledged, which could indicate financial stress or potential control changes.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of Indo Tech Transformers Ltd to the surveillance framework signals concerns about share encumbrance levels. This typically results in increased investor caution and potential impact on stock liquidity and valuation.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under this measure may experience reduced trading volumes and increased volatility as market participants factor in the heightened risk associated with high encumbrance levels.

**Investor Considerations**: The consolidated list of 12 securities represents companies requiring heightened monitoring. High promoter encumbrance can indicate financial stress, potential margin calls, or forced sales, making these securities higher risk investments.
