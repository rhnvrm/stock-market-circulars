## Impact Assessment

This is a significant government disinvestment event for IRFC, a Navratna PSU and the dedicated financing arm of Indian Railways. The sale of up to 4% of IRFC's equity (~52.27 crore shares) by the Government of India is likely to create short-term supply pressure on the stock. Retail investors have a dedicated window on T+1 Day, which may attract broad participation. Institutional investors should note the T Day window on February 25, 2026. The Oversubscription Option gives the Government flexibility to divest additional stake if demand is strong.
