title: Changes in Price Band for 30 Securities - Effective January 5, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 30 securities effective from January 5, 2026. The revised price bands range from 1% to 20%, replacing existing levels. This is a surveillance measure to control excessive volatility in these securities. Trading members are required to ensure compliance with the new price band limits.

## Key Points

- 30 securities subject to revised price bands effective January 5, 2026
- Price bands revised to: 1% (1 scrip), 2% (3 scrips), 5% (10 scrips), 10% (7 scrips), 20% (9 scrips)
- Most restrictive bands of 1% and 2% applied to Nutricircle Ltd, Octaware Technologies Ltd, Shri Keshav Cements, and Sri Chakra Cement
- Widest band of 20% for 9 securities including Bharat Gears, Manaksia Aluminium, Patron Exim, Pulsar International, and Stanbik Agro
- Notice issued by BSE Surveillance Department on January 2, 2026
- Clarifications to be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

Price band mechanism acts as a circuit breaker limiting the percentage by which a stock price can move up or down in a single trading day from the previous closing price. The revision represents enhanced surveillance measures for these specific securities, likely due to unusual price movements or volatility concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must enforce revised price band limits from January 5, 2026
- All orders and trades must comply with new percentage limits
- Members should update their trading systems to reflect revised bands
- Any clarifications required should be addressed to BSE surveillance email before effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** January 2, 2026
- **Effective Date:** January 5, 2026 (Sunday)
- **Applicable From:** First trading day on or after January 5, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Securities with tighter price bands (1%-5%) will experience restricted price movement, potentially reducing intraday volatility but may also impact liquidity. Traders and investors in these 30 securities need to adjust strategies accordingly.

**Market Participants Affected:** Retail and institutional investors holding or trading these securities, trading members executing orders, market makers, and algorithmic trading systems.

**Liquidity Considerations:** Tighter price bands may lead to more frequent circuit breaker hits, causing trading halts and reduced liquidity during volatile sessions. Securities with 1-2% bands (Nutricircle, Octaware, Shri Keshav Cements, Sri Chakra Cement) will be most constrained.

**Surveillance Rationale:** The varied price bands suggest differentiated risk assessment by BSE surveillance, with tighter bands likely applied to securities exhibiting higher volatility or unusual trading patterns.
