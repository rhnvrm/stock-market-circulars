## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact:**
Shareholders of Suraj Industries Limited holding partly paid-up shares must arrange Rs. 10 per share payment. For investors holding significant quantities, this represents a material cash outflow requirement. Failure to pay may result in forfeiture of shares or other consequences per company terms.

**Market Impact:**
Limited broader market impact as this affects only specific shareholders of one company. The call money collection is a standard corporate action for partly paid-up shares.

**Operational Impact:**
SCSBs and Trading Members need to activate systems to collect and process call money payments through the IBBS platform during the 15-day window.
