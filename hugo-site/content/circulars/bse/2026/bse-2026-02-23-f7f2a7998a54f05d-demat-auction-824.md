## Impact Assessment

This is a routine demat auction notice. Impact is limited to market participants (brokers and their clients) who had outstanding delivery obligations in Settlement No. 824. The largest quantities up for auction are GOKUL REFOILS (2,668 shares), MOIL Ltd (1,000 shares), Vistar Amar (1,001 shares), Swan Corp (750 shares), and Nippon India (500 shares). These participants face auction penalties and price risk from the auction process. Broader market impact is minimal as this is a standard settlement mechanism.
