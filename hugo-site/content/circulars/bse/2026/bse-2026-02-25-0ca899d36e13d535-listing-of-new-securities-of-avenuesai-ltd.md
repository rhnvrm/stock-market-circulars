## Impact Assessment

This listing increases the tradeable equity float of AvenuesAI Ltd. by 79,26,820 shares. As these are rights-converted shares, existing shareholders who exercised their rights will now have fully tradeable securities. The addition is pari-passu with existing shares, so no dilution in rights or entitlements for other shareholders beyond what was already disclosed at the rights issue stage. Impact is limited to participants in AvenuesAI Ltd. and is a routine post-rights-issue administrative step.
