## Summary

Effective January 20, 2026, 9 securities will be newly added to the ST-ASM framework, while 7 securities will be removed from the framework.

## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term ASM framework continues to apply enhanced surveillance measures to securities showing unusual price movements or volatility patterns. Securities in this framework are subject to additional monitoring and may have modified trading conditions to protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised list of securities under ST-ASM framework
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new surveillance measures
- Investors should be aware that securities under ST-ASM may have different trading parameters and restrictions
- SME scrips and T+0 scrips have specific markings as indicated in the circular

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 20, 2026 - All additions and removals from ST-ASM framework become effective

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 9 securities to ST-ASM indicates enhanced surveillance measures being applied due to unusual market activity or volatility patterns. This will result in:

- Modified trading conditions for these securities
- Enhanced monitoring and potential price bands or trading restrictions
- Improved investor protection through additional surveillance
- Reduced speculative activity in these securities

The removal of 7 securities suggests either improved trading patterns or migration to other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM in case of Auto Pins and PG Foils). This provides a net addition to the ST-ASM universe, indicating BSE's continued focus on market surveillance and investor protection.
