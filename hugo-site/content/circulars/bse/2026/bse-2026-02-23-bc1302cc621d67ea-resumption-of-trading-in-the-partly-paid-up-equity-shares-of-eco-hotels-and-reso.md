---

## Summary

Eco Hotels and Resorts Limited (BSE: 890225) has applied to BSE for resumption of trading in 88,54,060 partly paid-up equity shares on which first call money of Rs. 3.80 per share (Rs. 2.50 against face value and Rs. 1.30 against premium) has been received. The shares carry a paid-up value of Rs. 5/- each and will be available for trading under ISIN IN9638N01028.

## Key Points

- Total partly paid shares originally issued (as of September 26, 2025): 1,28,76,808
- Partly paid shares on which first call money has been received: 88,68,167
- Partly paid shares eligible for trading after resumption: 88,54,060
- First call money per share: Rs. 3.80 (Rs. 2.50 face value + Rs. 1.30 premium)
- Paid-up value per share available for trading: Rs. 5/-
- ISIN for shares eligible for trading: IN9638N01028
- No lock-in period applicable
- NSDL holding: 35,95,742 shares (Distinctive Nos. 51751136–55346877)
- CDSL holding: 52,58,318 shares (Distinctive Nos. 55352250–60610567)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is an operational action pursuant to the company receiving first call money on its partly paid-up shares, triggering eligibility for trading resumption under BSE listing norms.

## Compliance Requirements

- BSE Listing Operations to process the application and permit resumption of trading for the 88,54,060 eligible partly paid-up equity shares.
- The company (Eco Hotels and Resorts Limited) has submitted the requisite application signed by Executive Chairman Vinod Kumar Tripathi (DIN: 00798632).
- Shareholders holding these partly paid shares should ensure their demat accounts reflect the correct ISIN (IN9638N01028) for trading purposes.

## Important Dates

- September 26, 2025: Date as of which total partly paid shares issued were counted (1,28,76,808 shares)
- February 23, 2026: Date of application for resumption of trading
- Resumption of trading date: Subject to BSE approval (pending)

## Impact Assessment

The resumption of trading in 88,54,060 partly paid-up equity shares of Eco Hotels and Resorts Limited will restore liquidity for shareholders who have paid the first call money. Approximately 68.8% of the originally issued partly paid shares (88,54,060 out of 1,28,76,808) qualify for trading. The remaining ~40 lakh shares, on which first call money has not been received, remain ineligible for trading. This is a routine corporate action with moderate market impact, primarily affecting existing holders of these partly paid shares.
