## Impact Assessment

This disclosure is a routine compliance filing associated with the new listing of Accord Transformer & Switchgear Limited on BSE. The promoter group retains majority control at ~62%, which is typical for newly listed companies. The relatively lower demat percentage in the public category (49.15%) may indicate some retail/physical share holdings yet to be converted. No pledging or encumbrance on promoter shares is a positive indicator. Overall market impact is minimal and limited to prospective investors in this specific scrip.
