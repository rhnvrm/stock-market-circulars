## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform all clients about commencement of RE trading and clearly mention the ISIN (INE607V20010)

- **After February 06, 2026**: Unsubscribed/unrenounced REs will lapse and be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a company-specific corporate action affecting only existing shareholders of VIRAM SUVARN LIMITED. The RE trading window provides liquidity and flexibility for shareholders to either exercise, renounce, or trade their rights.

**Operational Impact**: Routine - Trading members need to follow standard RE trading procedures, ensure proper client communication, and include mandatory disclaimers in contract notes. The T+1 rolling settlement and trade-for-trade basis are standard protocols for RE transactions.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders of VIRAM SUVARN LIMITED have an 8-day window (January 23-30) to trade their rights entitlements and a 15-day window (January 23-February 06) to either subscribe to the rights issue or renounce their entitlements. Failure to act will result in lapse of rights.
