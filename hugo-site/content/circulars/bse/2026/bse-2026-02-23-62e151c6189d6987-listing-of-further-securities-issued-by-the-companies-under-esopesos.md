## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced. This is a standard operational listing notice under BSE's existing framework for ESOP/ESOS share admissions.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance obligations for market participants. The newly listed shares are freely tradeable from the effective date with no lock-in restrictions. Companies have already fulfilled their listing obligations prior to this notice.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 23, 2026
- **Trading Effective Date:** Tuesday, February 24, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry:** Not applicable (all shares listed without lock-in)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational circular with minimal market impact. The newly listed ESOP/ESOS shares represent incremental additions to each company's existing public float. For large-cap companies such as ICICI Bank (scrip code 532174) and Wipro (507685), the additions are negligible relative to their total outstanding shares. Bajaj Finserv's addition of 2.74 million shares is the largest by count but remains immaterial relative to its total share capital. No price-sensitive information is contained in this notice. Traders and investors should note that these shares become available for trading from February 24, 2026.
