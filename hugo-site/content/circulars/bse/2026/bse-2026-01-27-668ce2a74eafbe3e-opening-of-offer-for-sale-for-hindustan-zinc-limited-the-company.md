- SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-3/P/CIR/2024/6 dated January 23, 2024 (Framework for OFS to Employees)
- SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-3/P/CIR/2024/82 dated June 14, 2024 (Modification in Framework for OFS to Employees)

- OFS subject to restrictions on release and distribution in United States and other jurisdictions as per applicable securities laws
- Compliance with Regulation S under U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (as amended)

## Important Dates

- **January 27, 2026**: Notice issued to stock exchanges
- **January 28, 2026 (T day)**: OFS for non-Retail Investors only
- **January 29, 2026 (T+1 day)**: OFS for Retail Investors and non-Retail Investors with carry-forward bids

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - The OFS of up to 1.58% stake (including greenshoe) by the promoter in a major metal and mining company is significant and likely to create substantial trading volumes and potential price volatility in Hindustan Zinc shares.

**Liquidity Impact:** The offer provides an opportunity for institutional and retail investors to acquire shares through the stock exchange mechanism, potentially improving free float.

**Investor Implications:** Non-retail investors can participate on T day, while retail investors get their opportunity on T+1 day. Unallotted bids from non-retail investors can be carried forward to T+1 day.

**Promoter Holdings:** Post-OFS, Vedanta Limited's stake in Hindustan Zinc will reduce, though it will continue to remain the promoter with significant holding.
