## Impact Assessment

The listing involves a small preferential allotment of 57,725 shares to promoters, representing a minor increase in the total share capital of Prime Fresh Limited. The entire allotment is under lock-in until October 31, 2027, meaning these shares will not be available for market trading in the near term. The impact on market liquidity and price discovery is minimal. The warrant conversion at Rs. 164 per share signals the promoters' continued commitment to the company at that valuation.
