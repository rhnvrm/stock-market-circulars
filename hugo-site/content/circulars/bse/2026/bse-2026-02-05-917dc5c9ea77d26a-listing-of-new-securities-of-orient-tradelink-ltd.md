## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine listing notification for newly issued securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to enable trading in these new securities from February 6, 2026
- All 890,000 shares are subject to lock-in restrictions and cannot be transferred until August 31, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: September 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this is a company-specific listing event. The preferential allotment represents additional equity capital for Orient Tradelink Ltd through warrant conversion. The lock-in period until August 31, 2026 prevents immediate liquidity of these shares in the market, minimizing short-term supply pressure. This is a routine corporate action with no broader implications for market operations or trading rules.
