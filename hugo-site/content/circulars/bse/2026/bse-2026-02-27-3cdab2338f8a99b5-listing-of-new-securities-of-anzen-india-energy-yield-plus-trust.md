## Important Dates

| Event | Date |

| Trading Commencement | March 02, 2026 |
| Lock-in Expiry | March 03, 2027 |

## Impact Assessment

The listing of approximately 5.95 crore additional units at Rs. 117/- represents a notable equity dilution event for Anzen India Energy Yield Plus Trust. The preferential allotment to non-sponsors indicates fresh capital raising, likely for project acquisition or expansion purposes typical of InvITs. The one-year lock-in on all newly issued units limits immediate secondary market supply, which may support near-term price stability. Existing unitholders should note the pari-passu ranking, meaning the new units carry equivalent distribution and voting rights. The net effect on the trust's unit capital and NAV per unit will depend on deployment of the raised funds.
