## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must adhere to revised price band limits for all 22 scrips from March 02, 2026
- Orders placed outside the revised price band limits will be rejected by the exchange trading system
- Members should update their risk management and order entry systems accordingly

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 27, 2026
- **Effective Date:** March 02, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The revision of price bands directly limits the maximum permissible intraday price movement for the affected scrips. Scrips assigned a 5% band face the tightest trading constraints, indicating heightened surveillance concern, while those at 20% are subject to comparatively wider movement allowances. Most affected securities appear to be small-cap or SME-listed companies. Traders and investors holding positions in these 22 scrips should factor in the revised limits when placing orders from March 02, 2026. No broader market impact is expected.
