- The suspension is ahead of the **record date of 1 March 2026** fixed for full redemption of the debentures.

- Reference circular: DR-830/2025-2026.
- All trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the no-dealings date onward.

## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Circular Date | 24 February 2026 |
| No-Dealings Effective From | 27 February 2026 |
| Record Date (Redemption) | 1 March 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

This is a low-disruption, routine corporate action. The debenture is privately placed, limiting the universe of affected counterparties to institutional and qualified investors holding ISIN INE04VS07347. Trading members on the BSE debt segment must ensure compliance by blocking trades in this ISIN from 27 February 2026. Post-record date, the debenture will be redeemed and delisted from the debt segment. No broader market impact is anticipated.
