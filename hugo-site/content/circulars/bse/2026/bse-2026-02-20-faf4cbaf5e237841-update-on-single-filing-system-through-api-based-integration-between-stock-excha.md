title: Single Filing System Extended for XBRL Regulation 30 Events via API Integration
---

## Summary

BSE has extended the single filing system through API-based integration between stock exchanges to include additional XBRL events under Regulation 30 of SEBI LODR, effective February 21, 2026. This builds on the earlier circular NSE/CML/2024/28 dated September 30, 2024. Listed entities (equity and equity+debt) can now file certain disclosures once across both exchanges, though PDF filings for Regulation 30 events must still be submitted at both exchanges separately.

## Key Points

- Four new event categories added to single filing system effective February 21, 2026: Fraud/Default/Arrest, Corporate Debt Restructuring, Resolution Plan/Restructuring (ICA/OTS), and Issue Summary Document (ISD) for Buyback
- Coverage applies to Equity and Equity+Debt listed companies; REITs, InvITs, and exclusively debt entities are not yet covered for the new events
- PDF filing of Regulation 30 events must continue at both exchanges until further notice — not covered under single filing
- Listed entities must avoid duplicate filings of the same disclosure on both exchanges
- If any exchange seeks clarification post-submission, the listed entity must respond only to the exchange that raised the query
- Single filing for non-listed XBRL events under Regulation 30 is not yet available; separate submissions to all exchanges remain required

## Regulatory Changes

The following disclosures are newly added to the single filing system from February 21, 2026:

| Event | Regulation | Applicable To |
|---|---|---|
| Fraud/Default/Arrest | Reg 30, Sub-para 6, Para A Part A Schedule III | Equity, Equity+Debt |
| Corporate Debt Restructuring | Reg 30, Sub-para 9 & 10, Para A Part A Schedule III | Equity, Equity+Debt |
| Resolution Plan/Restructuring (ICA/OTS) | Reg 30 | Equity, Equity+Debt |
| Issue Summary Document (ISD) – Buyback | SEBI Circular on ISD | Equity, Equity+Debt |

Previously included disclosures remain in scope: Integrated Filing-Financials (Jan 3, 2026), Annual Secretarial Compliance Report (Sep 15, 2025), Integrated Filing-Governance (Mar 1, 2025), Shareholder Meetings & Voting Results (Dec 28, 2024), Reconciliation of Share Capital Audit Report (Nov 15, 2024), Corporate Governance Report (Oct 26, 2024), and Investor Grievance Report (Oct 1, 2024).

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed entities must use the single filing system for the newly added XBRL events under Regulation 30 from February 21, 2026 onward
- PDF filings for Regulation 30 events must still be submitted at both BSE and NSE independently until further notice
- Entities must not make duplicate filings of the same disclosure on both exchanges via the single filing system
- When an exchange seeks post-submission clarification, the entity must respond to that specific exchange only
- For queries, contact BSE helpdesk: 022-69158560 / 45720460 / 4570660 or email bse.regulation30@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **February 21, 2026**: New Regulation 30 XBRL events (Fraud/Default/Arrest, Corporate Debt Restructuring, ICA/OTS, ISD-Buyback) go live on the single filing system
- **January 3, 2026**: Integrated Filing-Financials added (already effective)
- **September 15, 2025**: Annual Secretarial Compliance Report added (already effective)
- **March 1, 2025**: Integrated Filing-Governance added (already effective)

## Impact Assessment

This update streamlines compliance operations for all equity and equity+debt listed companies by reducing redundant filings for select XBRL-based Regulation 30 events. The operational burden for compliance teams is reduced for covered events. However, the continued requirement for dual PDF filings and the exclusion of non-XBRL Regulation 30 events limits the full benefit of the single filing initiative. REITs, InvITs, and exclusively debt-listed entities see no change at this stage. Overall market impact is low, but operational impact on listed company compliance teams is moderate.
