title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities Addition, Stage Changes and
  Removal w.e.f. February 23, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective February 23, 2026. The update covers four categories: 2 newly shortlisted securities, 7 securities moving to a higher ESM stage, 9 securities moving to a lower ESM stage, and 18 securities being removed from the ESM framework entirely.

## Key Points

- 2 securities newly added to ESM framework w.e.f. February 23, 2026: JITF Infralogistics Ltd (540311) and Vistar Amar Ltd (538565)
- 7 securities escalated to a higher ESM stage due to continued surveillance concerns
- 9 securities de-escalated to a lower ESM stage reflecting improved compliance or price behaviour
- 18 securities exit the ESM framework entirely, including both mainboard and SME-listed companies
- Securities marked with `*` are listed as per NSE; securities marked `#` are SME scrips
- Certain securities exiting ESM may continue in Trade-for-Trade settlement as per earlier circulars (20251127-51, 20260105-26)
- No securities in this batch are marked as moving to SMP or IBC frameworks

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework is a surveillance mechanism applied by BSE to securities exhibiting abnormal price or volume behaviour. Securities placed under ESM are subject to trade-for-trade settlement and periodic review. This circular reflects the periodic review outcome, with securities reassigned across stages based on their surveillance indicators.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised ESM stage assignments for all affected securities effective February 23, 2026
- Securities under ESM are subject to trade-for-trade (T+1) settlement; margin and trading restrictions apply as per the applicable ESM stage
- Securities marked `#` are SME scrips and subject to SME-specific ESM provisions
- Securities exiting ESM but continuing in Trade-for-Trade settlement (per circulars 20251127-51 and 20260105-26) must be treated accordingly

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** February 23, 2026 — all ESM additions, stage changes, and removals take effect
- **Circular Date:** February 20, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine periodic review of the ESM framework. The impact is limited to investors and traders in the 36 specifically named securities, predominantly small-cap and SME-listed companies. Securities newly added to ESM (JITF Infralogistics, Vistar Amar) will face trade-for-trade restrictions, reducing liquidity. The 7 securities escalated to higher ESM stages face tighter trading restrictions. The 9 securities moved to lower stages and 18 removed from ESM may see improved liquidity and investor sentiment. No systemic or broad market impact is expected.
