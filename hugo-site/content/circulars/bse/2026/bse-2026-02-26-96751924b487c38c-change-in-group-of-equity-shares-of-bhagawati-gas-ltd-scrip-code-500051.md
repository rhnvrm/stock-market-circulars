## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that the equity shares of Bhagawati Gas Ltd. (Scrip Code: 500051) will be reclassified and included under the **'X' group** with effect from **March 05, 2026**. The 'X' group on BSE typically denotes companies that have failed to comply with listing requirements or have outstanding regulatory/compliance issues.

## Key Points

- The 'X' group classification indicates non-compliance with BSE listing norms.
- Trading members are advised to take note of this reclassification before executing trades in this scrip.
- Contact person for clarifications: Mrs. Kinjal More, Deputy Manager, Listing Compliance (Cell: +91-7304278788).

## Regulatory Changes

The scrip will be transferred from its current trading group to the **'X' group**, which imposes restricted trading conditions. Under 'X' group classification on BSE:
- The scrip trades under trade-to-trade (T2T) settlement, meaning delivery is compulsory for every transaction.
- Intraday/speculative trading is not permitted.
- This reclassification is a regulatory measure applied to companies not meeting listing compliance obligations.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading members** must update their systems and inform clients about the group change before March 05, 2026.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Effective Date of Group Change:** March 05, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The reclassification to the 'X' group carries significant implications for market participants:

- **Liquidity Risk:** Trading activity in the scrip is likely to decline sharply due to mandatory delivery-based settlement, discouraging speculative and intraday participants.
- **Investor Signal:** The move to 'X' group is a negative signal, indicating the company has not fulfilled its listing compliance obligations with BSE.
- **Operational Impact on Members:** Trading members must reconfigure risk and margin systems to reflect the T2T settlement requirement for this scrip from March 05, 2026.
- **Retail Investors:** Those holding positions should exercise caution and assess exposure given the heightened compliance and liquidity risks associated with 'X' group stocks.
