## Impact Assessment

This listing represents a routine preferential allotment for Kesar India Limited. The impact is limited to the specific company and its shareholders. The lock-in periods (ranging from approximately 7 months to 18 months from the notice date) ensure that the shares cannot be freely traded immediately, minimizing short-term market volatility. The total number of shares (31.98 lakh) will increase the company's equity base, potentially affecting existing shareholding percentages. Market participants should note the staggered lock-in release dates when assessing liquidity and trading volumes in this scrip.
