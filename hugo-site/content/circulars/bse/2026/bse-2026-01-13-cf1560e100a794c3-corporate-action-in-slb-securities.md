## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on SLB market participants who hold positions in these securities. The shut periods temporarily restrict liquidity in the SLB segment for these stocks. Participants must plan their strategies accordingly and may need to adjust positions before shut periods. The companies involved are large-cap stocks with significant market presence, so the impact on overall SLB operations is notable but temporary. The staggered dates across January 2026 help distribute the operational impact.
