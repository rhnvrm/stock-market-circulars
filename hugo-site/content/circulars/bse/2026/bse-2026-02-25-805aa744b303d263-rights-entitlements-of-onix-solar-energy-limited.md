## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that Rights Entitlements (REs) for ONIX SOLAR ENERGY LIMITED (Scrip Code: 751090, Scrip ID: ONIX-RE) will commence trading for renunciation purposes from Thursday, February 26, 2026. The REs will be settled on a T+1 Rolling Settlement basis on a trade-for-trade basis, and are tradable only in dematerialized form.

## Key Points

- Rights Entitlements (REs) for renunciation are permitted on BSE effective February 26, 2026
- Scrip Code: 751090 | Scrip ID: ONIX-RE | ISIN: INE173M20012
- Market Lot: 1 | Group: R
- Settlement: T+1 Rolling Settlement on trade-for-trade basis
- REs are tradable in dematerialized form only
- Trading members must inform clients that REs are not ordinary shares of the company
- Contract notes/bills must carry a prominent disclaimer about the nature of RE purchases
- Unlapsed REs neither subscribed nor renounced by the Issue Closing Date will be extinguished

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular operationalizes existing RE trading framework under BSE notices 20200305-21 (March 5, 2020) and 20200518-34 (May 18, 2020).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must notify all clients about the commencement of RE trading, clearly stating the ISIN (INE173M20012)
- Members must include a prominent disclaimer in contract notes and bills for RE purchases, informing clients that purchasing REs only entitles them to participate in the Rights Issue or renounce before closing
- Clients must be warned that REs that are neither subscribed with requisite application money nor renounced by the Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished

## Important Dates

- **RE Trading Period (Renunciation):** February 26, 2026 – March 2, 2026
- **Rights Issue Open Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Rights Issue Close Date:** March 6, 2026
- **Settlement Basis:** T+1 Rolling Settlement

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a moderate, company-specific impact. Existing shareholders of ONIX SOLAR ENERGY LIMITED who do not wish to subscribe to the Rights Issue have a short 5-day window (February 26 – March 2, 2026) to sell their Rights Entitlements on BSE. Investors buying REs during this period gain the right to participate in the ongoing Rights Issue. The trade-for-trade settlement mechanism limits speculative activity, and the demat-only restriction ensures orderly processing. Holders who neither subscribe nor renounce their REs by March 6, 2026 will lose their entitlements.
