## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects 140+ securities across diverse sectors including banking, power, metals, pharmaceuticals, mutual funds, and technology.

**Operational Impact:** Delivery failures indicate settlement issues for specific trading members. While the quantities for most scrips are small (under 100 shares), some securities have substantial auction quantities (Steel Authority: 60,000 shares, Camlin Fine: 23,159 shares) which may impact price discovery during auction.

**Investor Impact:** Limited direct impact on retail investors. Affects institutional participants and trading members involved in failed delivery obligations. Auction prices may be at premium to market prices, resulting in financial penalties for defaulting members.

**Sectoral Distribution:** Wide sectoral coverage including infrastructure, energy, metals, banking, pharmaceuticals, mutual funds, textiles, and technology, indicating delivery issues are not concentrated in any single sector.
