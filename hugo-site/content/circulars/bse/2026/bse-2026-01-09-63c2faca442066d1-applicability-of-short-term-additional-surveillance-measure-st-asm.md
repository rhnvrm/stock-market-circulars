title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework, detailing securities being added, moved between stages, and removed from the framework. Eight securities will be newly included in ST-ASM effective January 12, 2026, while ten securities will move out effective January 9, 2026. One security (V B Industries Ltd) will be moved to a lower stage within the framework.

## Key Points

- 8 securities shortlisted for ST-ASM 5/15/30 Days framework effective January 12, 2026
- 1 security (V B Industries Ltd) moved to lower Stage ASM effective January 12, 2026
- 10 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework effective January 9, 2026
- No securities moving to higher Stage ASM in this update
- Securities moving out are transitioning to other frameworks: Trade for Trade (5 securities), ESM (1 security), while others exit surveillance
- Framework includes both regular equity and SME scrips (marked with @)
- Consolidated list of 7 securities provided showing their current ST-ASM Stage I classification

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to operate as an enhanced surveillance mechanism for securities exhibiting unusual price movements or volatility. Securities are classified into different stages based on surveillance parameters and can move between stages or exit to other surveillance frameworks based on market behavior.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and investors should note the changed surveillance status of affected securities
- Enhanced margin requirements and trading restrictions apply to securities under ST-ASM framework
- Different trading conditions apply based on the specific ASM stage assigned to each security
- Market participants must comply with applicable surveillance measures for securities in their portfolios

## Important Dates

- **January 9, 2026**: Effective date for securities moving out of ST-ASM framework
- **January 12, 2026**: Effective date for new securities entering ST-ASM framework and stage changes

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of securities in ST-ASM framework typically results in:
- Higher margin requirements for trading these securities
- Reduced leverage availability
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Potential impact on liquidity due to enhanced surveillance
- Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of changed trading conditions

Securities moving out to Trade for Trade framework will face complete prohibition on intraday trading. The transition of securities between different surveillance frameworks indicates BSE's dynamic monitoring of market risks and investor protection measures.
