## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that Capital Small Finance Bank Ltd has fixed a record date of March 9, 2026, for early redemption and interest payment on its Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs). Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debenture series effective from March 9, 2026.

## Key Points

- Trading in the specified NCD series of Capital Small Finance Bank Ltd is suspended from March 9, 2026.
- The suspension is triggered by a record date set for early redemption and interest payment.
- The affected debenture series is CSFBL-11.75%-30-3-30-PVT with ISIN INE646H08012 (Scrip Code 951995).
- Notice reference: DR-835/2025-2026.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard operational notice under existing BSE listing compliance procedures for debt securities undergoing corporate actions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the debenture CSFBL-11.75%-30-3-30-PVT (INE646H08012 / 951995) from March 9, 2026 onwards.
- Members are required to take note of the suspension and ensure no transactions are executed in the affected security on or after the record date.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 24, 2026
- **Record Date:** March 9, 2026
- **No Dealings From:** March 9, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and traders of this specific NCD series (ISIN INE646H08012). The early redemption at 11.75% coupon rate indicates bondholders will receive principal repayment ahead of the original maturity of March 30, 2030. Liquidity in this instrument will cease from the record date. Broader market impact is minimal as this is a privately placed debt instrument.
