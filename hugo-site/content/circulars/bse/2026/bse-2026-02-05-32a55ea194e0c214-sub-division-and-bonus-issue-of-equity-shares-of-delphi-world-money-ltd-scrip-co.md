## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High. This dual corporate action will significantly increase the total number of shares outstanding from 8.18 crore to 24.53 crore shares (3x increase). The stock split improves affordability and liquidity by reducing the trading price per share, while the bonus issue rewards existing shareholders without cash outflow.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their shareholding triple (1 share becomes 5 shares post-split, then 15 shares after 2:1 bonus). While the total value remains unchanged, the increased share count and lower price point may attract retail investors.

**Trading Impact**: The stock will trade ex-bonus and ex-split from February 14, 2026. Price adjustment will reflect both actions. Enhanced liquidity expected due to lower price per share and increased float.

**Distinctive Numbers**: 
- Post Sub-Division: 1 to 8,17,55,925
- Bonus Shares: 8,17,55,926 to 24,52,67,775
