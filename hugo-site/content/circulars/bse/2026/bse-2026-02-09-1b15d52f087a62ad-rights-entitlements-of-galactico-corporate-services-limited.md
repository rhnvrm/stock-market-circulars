## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Inform all clients about commencement of RE trading
- Clearly mention the ISIN of the RE to avoid confusion with ordinary shares
- Include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases stating:
  - Purchase of REs only provides right to participate in ongoing Rights Issue by applying with requisite money OR renounce REs before issue closes
  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced by Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished
- Refer to notice 20200305-21 dated March 5, 2020 and notice 20200518-34 dated May 18, 2020 for additional details

**For Investors:**
- REs must be held in demat form for trading
- Must either subscribe with application money or renounce before February 23, 2026
- Unexercised REs will be extinguished after closing date

## Important Dates

- **February 9, 2026**: Circular issue date
- **February 11, 2026**: RE trading commences; Rights Issue opens
- **February 11-17, 2026**: RE trading period for renunciation
- **February 23, 2026**: Rights Issue closes (last date to subscribe or renounce)
- **Settlement**: T+1 basis for all RE trades

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Limited to existing shareholders and investors interested in GALACTICO CORPORATE SERVICES LIMITED. Short 7-day trading window for renunciation provides liquidity option for shareholders not wishing to participate in rights issue.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure proper client communication and contract note disclaimers. The trade-for-trade settlement and demat-only requirement necessitates specific operational handling distinct from regular equity trading.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders receive opportunity to monetize rights through renunciation if they choose not to subscribe. Clear timelines provided for decision-making, but unexercised rights will lapse, requiring active decision by February 23, 2026.
