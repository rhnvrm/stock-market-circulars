## Summary

BSE has approved the resumption of trading in partly paid-up equity shares of Adani Enterprises Limited (Scrip Code: 890227) following receipt of first call money. Out of 13.85 crore partly paid shares issued, 13.77 crore shares (on which call money was received) will be available for trading with a paid-up value of ₹0.75 per share.

## Key Points

- Total partly paid shares issued: 13,85,01,687 shares
- Shares on which first call money received: 13,77,96,213 shares
- Shares available for trading on resumption: 13,77,78,577 shares
- Paid-up value per share: ₹0.75
- First call money amount: ₹450.00 per right equity share
- ISIN for trading shares: IN9423A01048
- No lock-in period applicable
- Distinctive numbers range: From 1 to 137,781,101

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard procedure for resumption of trading following receipt of call money on partly paid-up shares issued through rights issue.

## Compliance Requirements

- Adani Enterprises Limited has submitted necessary documents for final listing and trading approval
- Company Secretary Jatin Jalundhwala (FCS-3064) has certified the details
- Distinctive number ranges have been provided for shares available for trading

## Important Dates

- **February 4, 2026**: Submission date for final listing documents and resumption of trading

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The resumption enables trading of approximately 13.77 crore partly paid-up shares, providing liquidity to shareholders who participated in the rights issue and paid the first call money. The paid-up value of ₹0.75 per share suggests this is part of a structured payment plan for rights shares.

**Operational Impact**: Standard corporate action with no lock-in restrictions, allowing immediate trading flexibility for shareholders. The difference between issued shares (13.85 crore) and tradeable shares (13.77 crore) indicates some shareholders did not pay the call money, resulting in forfeiture of approximately 7 lakh shares.
