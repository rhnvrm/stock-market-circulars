title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective February 5, 2026. The circular identifies securities being newly included in the ST-ASM framework, those moving between stages, and those exiting the framework. Seven securities are being newly added to ST-ASM Stage I, one security is moving to a lower stage, and eight securities are moving out of the framework entirely.

## Key Points

- 7 securities newly shortlisted for ST-ASM Stage I framework (5/15/30 days monitoring)
- 1 security (Antelopus Selan Energy Ltd) moving to lower stage ASM
- 8 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework
- Changes effective from February 5, 2026
- Framework includes both mainboard and SME securities
- Some securities marked as per NSE coordination (Apar Industries, Avalon Technologies)

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies short-term surveillance measures (5/15/30 day monitoring periods) to securities showing unusual price movements or volume patterns. Securities in this framework face:

- Enhanced monitoring by exchange
- Potential trading restrictions
- Staged surveillance with escalation to higher stages for continued anomalies
- Possible migration to other frameworks (LT-ASM, GSM, ESM, Trade for Trade, Pledge Framework)

## Securities Moving Into ST-ASM (Stage I)

1. Abate As Industries Ltd (531658)
2. Apar Industries Ltd (532259) - As per NSE
3. Avalon Technologies Ltd (543896) - As per NSE
4. Kabsons Industries Ltd (524675)
5. Purple Entertainment Ltd (540159)
6. Rnit Ai Solutions Ltd (517286)
7. Shiv Texchem Ltd (544272) - SME scrip

## Securities Moving to Lower Stage

- Antelopus Selan Energy Ltd (530075) - Moved to lower surveillance stage

## Securities Moving Out of ST-ASM

1. Dr Lalchandani Labs Ltd (541299) - SME
2. Indo Cotspin Ltd (538838)
3. Lotus Chocolate Company Ltd (523475)
4. Mercury Ev-Tech Ltd (531357)
5. Onesource Specialty Pharma Ltd (544292)
6. RLF Ltd (512618)
7. SHIPWAVES ONLINE LIMITED (544646) - SME
8. Zenith Steel Pipes & Industries Ltd (531845)

Note: Securities may exit ST-ASM due to migration to other surveillance frameworks including LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge Framework, or ESM Framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised surveillance status for affected securities
- Trading members should adjust risk management systems for securities under ST-ASM
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance status when trading these securities
- Increased margin requirements and trading restrictions may apply to ST-ASM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 5, 2026 - All surveillance changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The inclusion of 7 securities in ST-ASM may lead to reduced liquidity and increased volatility as the market adjusts to surveillance measures. The exit of 8 securities provides relief from restrictions.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ST-ASM face potential price freezes, reduced position limits, and increased margin requirements which can significantly impact trading strategies.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors holding positions in newly added securities should expect potential liquidity constraints and may face difficulty in executing large orders.

**Company Impact**: Companies added to ST-ASM may face reputational concerns and reduced investor interest until they exit the surveillance framework.
