## Impact Assessment

**High Impact Corporate Action**: This open offer represents a significant corporate event involving change in control and management of Shentracon Chemicals Limited. The acquisition of 26% stake by the Acquirers will result in substantial shareholding and control changes. Shareholders need to carefully evaluate the offer price of ₹0.50 per share (significantly below face value of ₹10) and decide whether to tender their shares. The offer provides an exit opportunity for public shareholders during this change in management phase. The absence of required statutory approvals as of now simplifies the transaction, though future approvals may be needed.
