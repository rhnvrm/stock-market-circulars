- IPO public issue tranche: 10,600,000 shares (distinctive nos. 29,375,001 to 39,975,000) are free — no lock-in

- Lock-in restrictions must be observed by promoters and pre-IPO shareholders as per their respective tranches
- Shares under lock-in are not transferable until the respective lock-in expiry dates
- Depository participants and members must ensure trading restrictions are enforced for locked-in tranches

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date:** 17 February 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry — Tranche 1 (Short-term):** 10 September 2026 (applies to 18,864,462 shares across multiple tranches)
- **Lock-in Expiry — Tranche 2 (Medium-term):** 10 March 2027 (applies to 2,515,538 shares across multiple tranches)

## Impact Assessment

The listing of Shree Ram Twistex Limited introduces 10,600,000 IPO shares as free float immediately available for trading. The remaining ~29.4 million shares are subject to varying lock-in periods, which limits near-term selling pressure from promoters and pre-IPO investors. The staggered lock-in expiry schedule (September 2026, March 2027, March 2029) means incremental supply will enter the market over three years. Overall market impact is contained and limited to existing shareholders and new IPO investors of this company.
