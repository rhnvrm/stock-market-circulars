## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing of ESOP shares is a routine corporate action that typically has limited immediate impact on stock prices. The quantities being listed are relatively small compared to the existing float of these companies, with the largest issuance being IDFC First Bank at approximately 1.09 million shares.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in available shares for trading across these 10 companies. Since there are no lock-in restrictions, all shares are immediately available for trading, which may provide slight additional liquidity.

**Investor Impact**: Employees who have exercised their stock options can now trade these shares on the exchange. The absence of lock-in periods provides immediate liquidity to option holders.
