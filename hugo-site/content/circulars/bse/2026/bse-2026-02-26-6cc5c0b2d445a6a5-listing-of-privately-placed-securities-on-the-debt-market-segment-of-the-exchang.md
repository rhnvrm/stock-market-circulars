## Impact Assessment

This is a low-impact, routine notice. The listing expands the tradeable universe of short-term debt instruments on the BSE Debt Segment. The instruments carry high-grade credit ratings (A1/A1+), suggesting minimal credit risk. Muthoot Fincorp's CP carries the longest tenor (approximately one year to February 2027), while others are shorter-dated (3–7 months). Equity market participants are unaffected. Relevant only to institutional and debt market trading members active in the BSE Debt Segment.
