## Impact Assessment

**Market Operations**: Moderate impact on SLB market participants who must manage their positions around the shut periods. The staggered dates across January-February 2026 allow for operational planning.

**Liquidity**: Temporary reduction in SLB availability for these 17 securities during their respective shut periods, which may affect short-selling strategies and hedging activities.

**Investor Impact**: Primarily affects institutional investors and traders using SLB facilities. Retail investors not involved in securities lending will see no direct impact beyond the standard dividend ex-date adjustments.
