## Impact Assessment

This is a routine, low-impact corporate action limited to holders of the specific NCD series (SHFL-13.10%-19-4-27-PVT). The reduction in face value to Rs. 30,952.39 reflects a partial principal repayment to debenture holders. No broader market impact is anticipated. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new face value from March 4, 2026 to avoid settlement discrepancies.
