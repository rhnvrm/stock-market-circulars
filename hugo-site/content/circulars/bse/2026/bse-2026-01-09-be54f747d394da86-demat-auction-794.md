## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational circular with minimal market impact. The auction mechanism helps resolve delivery failures in the settlement process. Impact is limited to:

- Members with delivery obligations in the listed securities
- Potential price volatility in the auction process for the specific quantities listed
- No broader market implications as this is a standard settlement process

The quantities involved are relatively small for most securities, indicating routine settlement shortages rather than systemic issues.
