## Impact Assessment

The auction affects shareholders and trading members involved in transactions where delivery obligations were not met. Members who failed to deliver will face auction costs and potential penalties. The auction ensures settlement completion and maintains market integrity. The wide range of securities and quantities indicates delivery failures across multiple transactions, though individual quantities for most securities are relatively small except for a few cases.
