## Compliance Requirements

- Securities in LT-ASM face enhanced surveillance measures proportional to their stage classification
- Trading members and investors must be aware of applicable restrictions on these securities
- Higher ASM stages typically involve stricter position limits, margin requirements, and price bands
- Securities marked with special indicators have transitioned to other surveillance frameworks (Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, IBC)

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** February 01, 2026
- **Circular Date:** January 30, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This surveillance action affects investors and traders in 20+ securities with varying degrees of impact. New entries into LT-ASM will face initial surveillance restrictions, while securities moving to higher stages will experience tighter trading controls. Conversely, securities moving to lower stages or exiting the framework will see reduced restrictions, potentially improving liquidity. The movement of Spice Lounge Food Works to Trade for Trade framework represents the most stringent surveillance measure, limiting trading to delivery-based transactions only.
