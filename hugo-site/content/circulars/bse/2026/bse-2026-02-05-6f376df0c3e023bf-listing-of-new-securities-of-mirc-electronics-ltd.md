## Impact Assessment

**Dilution Impact**: The preferential issue of 8.89 crore shares represents significant equity dilution for existing shareholders. The actual dilution percentage depends on the pre-issue share capital, but given the large quantum, it could be material.

**Pricing**: The issue price of Rs. 16.81 per share will serve as a reference point for market participants. The premium of Rs. 15.81 over face value indicates the shares were issued at a substantial premium.

**Liquidity**: The addition of 8.89 crore shares will increase the free float once the lock-in expires on August 15, 2026, potentially improving liquidity in the scrip.

**Lock-in Period**: The 6-month lock-in period (from allotment to August 2026) means these shares will not be available for trading by the allottees until mid-August 2026, limiting immediate supply pressure.

**Non-Promoter Allotment**: The fact that shares were issued to non-promoters suggests capital raising from institutional or strategic investors rather than promoter group entities.
