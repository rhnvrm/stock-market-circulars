## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of two securities into their respective Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages. Aarcon Facilities Limited (ISIN: INE056J01015, Security Code: 532024) is moving to GSM Stage I, while Shashank Traders Limited (ISIN: INE508R01018, Security Code: 540221) is moving to GSM Stage II. The circular also notes that securities may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure) or IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) frameworks.

## Key Points

- Aarcon Facilities Limited (Security Code: 532024, ISIN: INE056J01015) moved to GSM Stage I
- Shashank Traders Limited (Security Code: 540221, ISIN: INE508R01018) moved to GSM Stage II
- Securities marked with (#) move to lower GSM Framework due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- Securities marked with ($) move to lower GSM Framework due to inclusion in IBC Framework
- Certain parameters are based on NSE data as indicated by (*)

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the Graded Surveillance Measure framework, which places securities under enhanced monitoring based on market behavior and parameters. The GSM framework operates in multiple stages, with each stage imposing progressively stricter surveillance and trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should be aware of the GSM stage classifications for these securities
- Trading in these securities will be subject to the conditions applicable to their respective GSM stages
- Investors and traders should review the GSM framework guidelines for understanding the implications of each stage
- Enhanced disclosure and monitoring requirements may apply to these securities

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: February 04, 2026
- The GSM stage changes are effective as per the circular date

## Impact Assessment

The movement of these securities into GSM stages indicates that the exchange has identified certain market parameters warranting enhanced surveillance. For Aarcon Facilities Limited entering GSM Stage I, this is the initial level of surveillance with relatively minimal trading restrictions. Shashank Traders Limited entering GSM Stage II faces more stringent surveillance measures. Investors in these securities should be aware of the increased monitoring and potential future restrictions if the securities move to higher GSM stages. The GSM framework is designed to protect investor interests by identifying and monitoring securities with abnormal price movements or trading patterns.
