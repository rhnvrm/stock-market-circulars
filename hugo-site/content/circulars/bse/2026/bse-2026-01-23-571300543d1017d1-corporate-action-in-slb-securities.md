## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects liquidity in the SLB segment for 25 securities across various sectors including power (NTPC, GAIL), pharmaceuticals (Sun Pharma, Nestle India), IT services (Mastek, COFORGE, Zensar), financial services (IIFL Finance, HUDCO), and manufacturing sectors.

**Operational Impact:** SLB participants will experience temporary restrictions on lending and borrowing activities for these securities during the specified shut periods. This may impact short-selling strategies and securities financing operations.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders holding positions in these securities will be eligible for dividends if held through the respective record dates. SLB foreclosure restrictions prevent new lending during shut periods to ensure proper dividend entitlement tracking.

**Sectoral Distribution:** The circular affects a diverse range of sectors including utilities, technology, consumer goods, energy, and financial services, indicating widespread dividend distribution activity across the market.
