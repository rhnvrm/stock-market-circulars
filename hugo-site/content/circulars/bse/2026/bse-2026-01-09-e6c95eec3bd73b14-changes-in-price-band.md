title: Changes in Price Band for 35 Securities Effective January 12, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 35 securities effective January 12, 2026. The price bands range from 1% to 20%, replacing previous levels. Price bands restrict the maximum percentage deviation allowed in a stock's price during a trading session, serving as a volatility control mechanism.

## Key Points

- 35 scrips will have revised price bands effective January 12, 2026
- Price band revisions range from 1% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive)
- Strictest band (1%): Deccan Bearings Ltd, Filtron Engineers Ltd, Onix Solar Energy Ltd
- Widest bands (20%): Narmada Agrobase Ltd, Shree Refrigerations Ltd, Sigma Solve Ltd
- Most common band is 5% (applied to 16 securities)
- 10% band applied to 11 securities
- Clarifications can be sought at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

This represents a surveillance measure where BSE adjusts price bands based on stock volatility, liquidity, and trading patterns. Tighter bands (1-5%) indicate higher surveillance concerns, while wider bands (10-20%) suggest relatively normal trading conditions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure trading systems are updated with new price bands by January 12, 2026
- Orders exceeding the revised price bands will be rejected
- Trading members should inform clients about the revised limits for affected securities
- Systems must enforce the new bands from market opening on the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 9, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 12, 2026 (trading session opening)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities with tighter bands (1-5%) will experience restricted intraday volatility, limiting profit potential but also reducing risk. This may reduce liquidity and trading volumes for these stocks.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in these 35 securities need to adjust their intraday trading strategies, particularly for stocks moving to stricter bands. Stop-loss and target orders may need recalibration.

**Market Operations**: Broker systems must be reconfigured to enforce new limits. The varying band levels (1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%) suggest differentiated surveillance concern levels across the 35 securities.

**Surveillance Context**: The inclusion of stocks like Narmada Agrobase, Shree Refrigerations, and Sigma Solve at 20% bands suggests less concern, while 1% bands on Deccan Bearings, Filtron Engineers, and Onix Solar Energy indicate heightened surveillance requirements.
