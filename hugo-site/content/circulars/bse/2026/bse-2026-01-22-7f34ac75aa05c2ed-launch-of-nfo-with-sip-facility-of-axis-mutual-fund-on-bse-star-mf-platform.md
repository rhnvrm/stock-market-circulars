## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine NFO launch that provides investors with a new investment option in an index fund tracking BSE India Sector Leaders Index.

**Operational Impact**: Members/distributors on BSE StAR MF platform need to process NFO orders, manage fund collection timelines, and ensure compliance with specified cut-off times for fund initiation, SIP authentication, and payment clearing. The strict timelines for fund availability and transaction processing require operational coordination between members, clients, and the AMC.
