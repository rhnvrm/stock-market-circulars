## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders and traders of the specific NCD series (360OPL-9.03%-28-1-26-PVT). The suspension prevents secondary market trading as the debentures approach redemption.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will receive redemption proceeds and final interest payment based on holdings as of the record date. Those looking to exit positions must do so before January 13, 2026.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems and processes prevent any transactions in the specified debentures from the suspension date. Standard procedure for debt securities nearing maturity/redemption.
