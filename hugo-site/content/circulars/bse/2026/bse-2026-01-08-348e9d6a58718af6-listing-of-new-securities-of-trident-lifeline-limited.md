## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The preferential allotment represents a small number of shares issued to promoters with a lock-in period of over 18 months. This indicates promoter commitment but will not affect free float or trading volumes in the near term.

**Operational Impact**: Routine listing process with no operational changes for market participants. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the increased share capital.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution, though the shares are locked-in and issued to promoters. The warrant conversion suggests promoter confidence in the company's prospects.
