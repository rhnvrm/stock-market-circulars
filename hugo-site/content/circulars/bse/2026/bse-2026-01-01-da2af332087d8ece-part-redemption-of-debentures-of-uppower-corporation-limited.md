## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of U.P.POWER CORPORATION LIMITED's non-convertible debentures. The part redemption will return capital to debenture holders while reducing the outstanding principal amount.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems reflect the reduced face value from January 5, 2026 to ensure accurate pricing and settlement. The reduction in face value indicates partial capital return to investors, with the remaining principal continuing to earn the 9.75% coupon rate until maturity in October 2026.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders on record as of January 5, 2026 will receive interest payment and partial redemption of principal. Post-redemption, the investment size per debenture will be Rs. 750,000, affecting yield calculations and portfolio valuations.
