---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 14 securities effective January 7, 2026, as part of surveillance measures. The revised bands range from 2% to 10%, with most securities being placed under tighter restrictions compared to standard price bands.

## Key Points

- 14 scrips will have revised price bands effective January 7, 2026
- Price bands revised to 2%, 5%, or 10% depending on the security
- Three securities (ABM Knowledgeware, CMX Holdings, Shentracon Chemicals) placed under strictest 2% band
- Six securities placed under 10% band (AI Champdany, Goyal Aluminiums, Pulsar International, United Van Der Horst)
- Five securities placed under 5% band (Betex India, Karnavati Finance, KSR Footwear, Lasa Supergenerics, Mirc Electronics, Vision Cinemas, Vivimed Labs)
- Notice issued by Surveillance Department indicating enhanced monitoring

## Regulatory Changes

Price band restrictions are being revised from existing levels to new specified percentages. This represents a surveillance measure to control volatility and unusual price movements in these specific securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands from January 7, 2026
- All trades must occur within the new price band limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** January 6, 2026
- **Effective Date:** January 7, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The revised price bands will limit intraday price movement for these 14 securities, potentially reducing trading opportunities but also protecting against excessive volatility.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to update their systems and alert clients about the tighter price movement limits for these scrips. Securities with 2% bands will have significantly restricted trading ranges.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities will face limited price discovery and reduced intraday movement potential, which may affect liquidity and trading strategies.
