## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Limited systemic impact as this is a routine redemption process. The suspension affects only specific commercial paper instruments and does not impact equity trading or other debt instruments of these companies.

**Liquidity Impact:** Temporary reduction in liquidity for the specified commercial papers, though this is expected as part of the normal redemption cycle.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding these commercial papers will receive redemption proceeds on the respective maturity dates. No trading opportunity available from the no-dealing dates.

**Sector Coverage:** Diverse sector representation including financial services (Bajaj Finance, ECL Finance, Fedbank), infrastructure (L&T Metro Rail, KEC International), manufacturing (Supreme Industries, Time Technoplast), power (JSW Energy, Tata Power), housing finance (Godrej Housing Finance, Bajaj Housing Finance), and media (Network 18).
