The auction, conducted by RBI, will offer 11 SDL securities from 7 states (Assam, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and Uttarakhand) with a total issue size of Rs. 13,000 crores.

- Mix of new issuances and one re-issuance (7.25% KA 2032)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular is issued in continuation of Exchange circular no. 20191122-28 dated November 22, 2019, which launched the non-competitive bidding facility for SDL auctions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the NCB-GSec module of BSE's iBBS web-based system (https://ibbs.bseindia.com)
- Direct investors must submit bids by January 19, 2026
- Trading members must submit bids by January 20, 2026 till 8:00 am
- Minimum bid amount: Rs. 10,000 (100 units)

## Important Dates

- **January 19, 2026**: Bid collection end date for direct investors
- **January 20, 2026 (till 8:00 am)**: Bid collection end date for members
- **January 20, 2026**: Auction date
- **January 21, 2026**: Settlement date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The auction involves a substantial issuance of Rs. 13,000 crores in SDL securities, which will add to the supply of state government debt instruments in the market. Karnataka's significant allocation (Rs. 6,000 crores) indicates substantial state borrowing requirements.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and debt market participants can participate in the SDL auction through the established non-competitive bidding route, providing retail and institutional investors access to state government securities without competing in the primary auction process.

**Liquidity Impact**: The diverse maturity profile (2032 to 2056) provides investors with multiple duration options. The re-issuance of 7.25% KA 2032 may enhance liquidity in that existing security.
