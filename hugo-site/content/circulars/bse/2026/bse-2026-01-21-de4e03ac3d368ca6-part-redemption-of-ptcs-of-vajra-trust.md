## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action notification for partial redemption of debt securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the reduced face values for all affected PTCs
- All trading in these PTCs must reflect the new face values
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the reduced face values before trading commences on January 22, 2025

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 21, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 22, 2025 (PTCs will trade with reduced face values from this date)

## Impact Assessment

This is a low-impact administrative update affecting only holders and traders of specific Vajra Trust PTCs in the debt segment. The partial redemption reduces the outstanding principal amount of these securities, which is reflected in the reduced face values. Market participants trading these specific instruments need to be aware of the updated valuations for accurate pricing and settlement. No broader market implications exist beyond these specific securities.
