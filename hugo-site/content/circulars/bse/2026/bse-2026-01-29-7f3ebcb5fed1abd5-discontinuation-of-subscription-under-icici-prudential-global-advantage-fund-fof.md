## Summary

The scheme could not be classified under any category specified in the new framework and will be required to merge or wind up within 3 years from January 20, 2026. All fresh subscriptions and SIP/STP registrations will be discontinued from February 5, 2026, while redemptions and switch-outs will continue.

## Key Points

- Scheme grandfathered effective January 27, 2026 as it does not fit any category under SEBI's new FOF framework
- Mandatory merger or winding up required by January 20, 2029 (3 years from SEBI permission date)
- All existing SIP and STP-IN registrations will be discontinued from February 5, 2026
- IDCW reinvestment option will be changed to IDCW Payout from February 5, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI issued a framework on February 6, 2025 regarding 'Framework for launching of Fund of Fund (FOF) schemes with multiple underlying Funds' which required FOF schemes to be classified under specific categories. ICICI Prudential Global Advantage Fund (FOF) could not be classified under any of these categories with its existing asset allocation and investment objective. SEBI granted grandfathering permission on January 20, 2026, allowing the scheme to continue temporarily but requiring it to merge or wind up within 3 years.
