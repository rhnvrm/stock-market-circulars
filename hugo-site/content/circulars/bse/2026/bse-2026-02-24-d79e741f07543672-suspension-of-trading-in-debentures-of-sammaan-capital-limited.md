## Summary

BSE Notice No. 20260224-44 informs trading members that Sammaan Capital Limited has fixed a record date of March 9, 2026, for redemption and interest payment on four Non-Convertible Debenture (NCD) series. Trading members are directed not to deal in these debentures from March 9, 2026, onwards.

## Key Points

- Four NCD series of Sammaan Capital Limited are subject to trading suspension effective March 9, 2026.
- The suspension applies to both redemption of principal and payment of interest.
- Record date fixed is March 9, 2026, with actual redemption/maturity date of March 23, 2026.
- The circular is issued under DR-835/2025-2026.
- Issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance And Operations.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard procedural notice under existing BSE rules requiring suspension of trading in debt securities ahead of corporate actions (redemption/interest payment).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the following debentures from March 9, 2026:
  - **SC-9.90%-23-3-26-NCD** | ISIN: INE148I07OB8 | Code: 938478
  - **SCL-9.48%-23-3-26-NCD** | ISIN: INE148I07NZ9 | Code: 938480
  - **SCL-9.90%-23-3-26-NCD** | ISIN: INE148I07NY2 | Code: 938482
  - **SCL-9%-13-03-26-PVT** | ISIN: INE148I07EA1 | Code: 953585
- Members must take note of the no-dealings restriction and ensure compliance.

## Important Dates

- **February 24, 2026**: Circular issuance date.
- **March 9, 2026**: Record date; no dealings permitted from this date for all four NCD series.
- **March 23, 2026**: Redemption/maturity date for three series (9.90% and 9.48% and 9.00% tranches).

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and traders of these specific Sammaan Capital Limited NCD series in the BSE debt segment. The suspension is a routine pre-redemption measure ensuring clean settlement. Debenture holders with these ISINs should note that their securities will be redeemed on March 23, 2026, and secondary market trading will cease from March 9, 2026. No broader market impact is anticipated.
