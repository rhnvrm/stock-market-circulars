## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. This is a routine listing of preferential shares allotted to promoters through warrant conversion. The shares represent approximately 3.5% addition to the existing equity base (assuming total shares around 32 million based on distinctive numbers). The two-year lock-in period ensures these shares cannot be sold until July 2027, preventing immediate dilution concerns. Standard corporate action with no implications for trading members beyond awareness of the increased share capital.
