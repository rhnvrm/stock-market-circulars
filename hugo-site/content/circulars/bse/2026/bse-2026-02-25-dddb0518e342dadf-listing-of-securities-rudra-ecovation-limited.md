## Summary

BSE has listed 2,220,000 new equity shares of Rudra Ecovation Limited (Scrip Code: 514010, ISIN: INE723D01021) issued to promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to the conversion of warrants. These shares are permitted to trade on the Exchange with effect from Thursday, February 26, 2026. The shares were allotted at an issue price of Rs. 48.00 per share (face value Rs. 1/- plus premium of Rs. 47.00) and are subject to a lock-in period until November 1, 2027.

## Key Points

- 2,220,000 equity shares of Rs. 1/- each listed at a premium of Rs. 47.00 (issue price Rs. 48.00)
- Shares allotted to Promoters on a preferential basis via conversion of warrants
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares of the company
- Distribution Numbers: 116058001 to 118278000
- Date of Allotment: January 9, 2026
- ISIN: INE723D01021
- All 2,220,000 shares are under lock-in until November 1, 2027

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification for newly allotted securities under a preferential issue pursuant to warrant conversion.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new listing and permitted trading from February 26, 2026
- The 2,220,000 shares allotted to promoters are subject to a mandatory lock-in and cannot be traded until November 1, 2027
- Market participants should update records to reflect the new distribution numbers (116058001 to 118278000)

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** January 9, 2026
- **Trading Effective Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry:** November 1, 2027

## Impact Assessment

The listing is limited in market impact as all newly issued shares are subject to a lock-in period until November 2027, meaning they will not enter the tradeable float immediately. The preferential allotment to promoters via warrant conversion is a standard corporate action. The addition of 2,220,000 shares to the total issued capital of Rudra Ecovation Limited (Scrip Code 514010) represents a dilution event for existing shareholders, but the locked-in nature of these shares limits near-term liquidity or price impact.
