## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 108 different securities across various sectors. While the auction is a routine settlement mechanism, large quantities in some scrips (particularly Sunshine Capital with over 1 million shares) could see temporary price volatility during auction execution.

**Operational Impact:** Standard impact on clearing members who have short positions. They must arrange funds to participate in the auction and cover their shortages. The auction ensures market integrity by completing failed settlements.

**Investor Impact:** Minimal direct impact on retail investors. The auction mechanism ensures that buyers receive their securities even when original sellers default on delivery obligations.
