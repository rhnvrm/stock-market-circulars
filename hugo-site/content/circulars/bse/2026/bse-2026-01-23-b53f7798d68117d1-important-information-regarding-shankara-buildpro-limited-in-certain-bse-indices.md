---

## Summary

BSE Index Services Private Ltd announced that Shankara Buildpro Limited (Scrip code: 544517) will be excluded from multiple BSE indices effective prior to trading on January 28, 2026. This action follows the company's failure to hit the lower circuit on January 22-23, 2026, as part of the previously announced process for removal of spun-off scrips from BSE Indices following demerger schemes (Notice No: 20250403-46).

## Key Points

- Shankara Buildpro Limited (Scrip code: 544517) to be removed from 10 BSE indices
- Exclusion follows demerger scheme arrangement protocol announced in Notice No: 20250403-46
- Company did not hit lower circuit on Thursday, January 22, 2026 and Friday, January 23, 2026
- Removal affects major indices including BSE SMALLCAP, BSE ALLCAP, BSE 1000, and BSE NEXT 500
- Corporate action included in end-of-day corporate action file (*.SDE)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This action implements the existing process announced via Notice No: 20250403-46 for removal of spun-off scrips from BSE Indices in the event of a scheme of arrangement for demerger post-listing.

## Compliance Requirements

- Index fund managers and passive investment vehicles tracking affected indices must rebalance portfolios
- Market participants should note the exclusion for portfolio management and trading strategies
- Queries should be directed to bseindex@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **January 22, 2026**: First observation date (lower circuit not hit)
- **January 23, 2026**: Second observation date (lower circuit not hit)
- **January 28, 2026**: Effective exclusion date from all listed BSE indices prior to market open

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Removal from 10 indices including major benchmarks like BSE SMALLCAP will trigger forced selling by passive funds and index-tracking portfolios. The exclusion affects broad market indices (BSE ALLCAP, BSE 1000) as well as segment-specific indices (BSE CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY, BSE NEXT 500, BSE NEXT 250, MICROCAP).

**Trading Impact**: Liquidity may be affected as index funds rebalance. Weight redistribution will occur among remaining constituents in affected indices.

**Affected Indices**:
1. BSE SMALLCAP
2. BSE ALLCAP
3. BSE CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY
4. BSE 1000
5. BSE NEXT 500
6. BSE NEXT 250
7. MICROCAP
8. BSE 1000 MULTICAP EQUAL SIZE WEIGHTED (25%)
9. BSE MIDSMALLCAP
