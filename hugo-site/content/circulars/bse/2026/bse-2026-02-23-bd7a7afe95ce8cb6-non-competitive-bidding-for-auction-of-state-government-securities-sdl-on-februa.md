## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt market operation notice with moderate impact on fixed-income market participants. The auction covers a large number of SDL securities (34 in total) across 16 states with individual issue sizes ranging from Rs. 100 Cr (Goa) to Rs. 2,000 Cr (Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan, West Bengal), implying significant total liquidity injection into state government finances. Equity markets are not directly affected. Trading members and institutional investors active in the government securities segment should act promptly given the tight bid window for members (closing at 8:00 AM on auction day). The availability of both new issues and re-issues across multiple maturities (2029–2055) offers portfolio diversification opportunities for debt investors.
