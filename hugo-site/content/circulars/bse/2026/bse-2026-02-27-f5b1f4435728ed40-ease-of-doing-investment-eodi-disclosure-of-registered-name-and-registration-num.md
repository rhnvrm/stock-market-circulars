  Media Platforms'

## Summary

SEBI has issued circular HO/(79)2026-MIRSD-PODMMC dated 26-02-2026 under the Ease of Doing Investment (EoDI) initiative, mandating that all SEBI regulated entities and their agents disclose their registered name and SEBI registration number on social media platforms (SMPs). The measure aims to help investors distinguish content posted by regulated entities from that posted by unregistered persons, thereby enhancing investor protection and transparency in the securities market.

## Key Points

- All SEBI-regulated intermediaries and their agents must prominently display their registered name and SEBI registration number on the home page of their social media handles.
- Disclosure is also required at the beginning of each video/content related to the securities market uploaded on any SMP.
- Covered platforms include YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Threads, Telegram, Reddit, and similar platforms — both closed and public groups.
- Entities with a single SEBI registration must state their registered name and registration number directly on the social media handle home page and in each content piece.
- Entities with multiple SEBI registrations must provide a weblink on their handle home page directing to their website listing all registered names and numbers; and disclose the specific registration relevant to each content piece at the beginning of that content.
- Agents of regulated entities (e.g., mutual fund distributors, PMS distributors) are also covered and must make equivalent disclosures.

## Regulatory Changes

- New disclosure obligations introduced for all persons regulated by SEBI under Section 12 of the SEBI Act, 1992 with respect to social media activity related to the securities market.
- 'Persons regulated by the Board' is defined with reference to Chapter IIIA — Explanation 1 of Regulation 16A of SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008.
- This circular extends existing code of conduct requirements into the social media domain.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Stock Brokers (SBs):** Display SEBI registration name and number on SMP home pages and in all securities-related content.
- **Depository Participants (DPs):** Same as above.
- **Registrar to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents (RTAs):** Same as above.
- **Investment Advisers (IAs):** Same as above.
- **Research Analysts (RAs):** Same as above.
- **InvITs, REITs, SMREITs, AIFs, Portfolio Managers, CIS, MFs/AMCs/AMFI:** Same as above.
- **Agents (MF distributors, PMS distributors, etc.):** Must disclose their own registration details prominently on social media handles and in content.
- For entities with multiple registrations, a website link listing all registrations must appear on the SMP home page, and the specific applicable registration must be stated at the start of each content piece.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** 26 February 2026
- **Effective Date:** Not explicitly stated in the available text; entities should refer to the full circular for implementation timelines.

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a broad but operationally manageable impact across all SEBI-regulated intermediaries active on social media. It is a compliance and disclosure requirement rather than a trading or market-structure change, so it carries no direct price or liquidity impact on securities. The primary burden falls on compliance and marketing teams of registered entities who will need to update their social media profiles and content workflows. Smaller entities and individual agents (e.g., MF distributors) with active social media presence may require more effort to comply. The measure is positive for retail investors as it enables easier identification of SEBI-regulated content creators, reducing the risk of being misled by unregistered persons.
