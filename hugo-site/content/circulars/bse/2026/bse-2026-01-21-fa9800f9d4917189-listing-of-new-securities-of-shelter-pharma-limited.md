## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The listing represents approximately 14.7 lakh shares with staggered lock-in periods, limiting immediate tradable float. The preferential allotment increases the total share capital of Shelter Pharma Limited.

**Shareholder Impact**: Dilution effect on existing shareholders due to new share issuance. Lock-in provisions ensure gradual release of shares into the market, with majority of shares (10.03 lakh) locked until August 2026 and remaining 4.66 lakh shares locked until August 2027.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact on liquidity due to lock-in restrictions. Tradable portion will increase progressively as lock-in periods expire in August 2026 and August 2027.
