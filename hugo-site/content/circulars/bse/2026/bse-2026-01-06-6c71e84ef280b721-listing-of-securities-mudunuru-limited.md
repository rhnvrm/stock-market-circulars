## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine preferential allotment to promoters with standard lock-in provisions. The shares cannot be traded until July 2027, limiting immediate market supply impact.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new securities and ensure lock-in compliance.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may see dilution of approximately 3.5% (assuming pre-issue base), but the lock-in period provides stability. The preferential issue to promoters may indicate confidence in the company's prospects.
