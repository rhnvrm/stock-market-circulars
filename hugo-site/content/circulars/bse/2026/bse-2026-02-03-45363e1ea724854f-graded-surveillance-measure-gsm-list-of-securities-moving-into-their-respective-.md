## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of two securities into higher stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective from the date of this circular. Carnation Industries Ltd. (Security Code: 530609, ISIN: INE081B01028) is moving to GSM Stage III, while Pioneer Agro Extracts Ltd. (Security Code: 519439, ISIN: INE062E01014) is moving to GSM Stage IV. The GSM framework applies enhanced surveillance and trading restrictions to securities based on specific market criteria.

## Key Points

- Carnation Industries Ltd. (530609) upgraded to GSM Stage III
- Pioneer Agro Extracts Ltd. (519439) upgraded to GSM Stage IV
- Movement indicates heightened surveillance and stricter trading conditions for these securities
- Securities can move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure) Framework (marked #)
- Securities can move to lower GSM stages if included in IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) Framework (marked $)
- Some classifications are as per NSE (marked *)

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements stage progression within the existing Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. GSM is a mechanism to alert investors and enhance market surveillance for securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or other concerns. Higher GSM stages typically involve:

- Additional surveillance by the exchange
- Trade-to-trade settlement (no intraday trading)
- Price bands restrictions
- 100% upfront margin requirements
- Periodic reporting requirements for listed entities

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Must adhere to GSM Stage III and IV trading restrictions for the affected securities
- Ensure 100% upfront margin collection from clients
- Follow trade-to-trade settlement procedures
- Implement enhanced due diligence for client orders in these securities

**For Investors:**
- Understand that these securities face enhanced surveillance
- Be aware of trading restrictions and settlement obligations
- Exercise heightened caution when trading these securities

**For Listed Companies:**
- May be required to submit periodic disclosures
- Should address concerns that led to GSM stage progression

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** February 3, 2026 (date of circular issuance)
- Securities will be subject to respective GSM stage restrictions from this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Trading volumes in affected securities likely to decrease due to stricter conditions
- Liquidity will be significantly reduced, especially for Pioneer Agro Extracts in Stage IV
- Price discovery may be impacted due to trade-to-trade settlement requirements
- Institutional participation may decline in these securities

**Investor Impact:**
- Existing investors face potential exit difficulties due to reduced liquidity
- Higher capital requirements (100% upfront margin) may deter new investors
- Increased risk perception may lead to price volatility
- No intraday trading opportunities available

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers must update systems to enforce GSM restrictions
- Enhanced monitoring and compliance burden for trading members
- Risk management systems need adjustment for margin requirements

**Severity Rationale:**
The movement to GSM Stage III and especially Stage IV represents serious concerns about these securities, warranting high severity and impact ratings. Stage IV is among the highest surveillance levels before potential suspension, indicating significant regulatory concern.
