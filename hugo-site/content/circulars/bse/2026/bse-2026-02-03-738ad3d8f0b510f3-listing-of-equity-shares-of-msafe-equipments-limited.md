## Impact Assessment

This is a routine regulatory compliance filing with no material market impact. The shareholding pattern indicates a standard post-IPO structure with majority promoter holding (approximately 73%) and minimum public float (approximately 27%) meeting SEBI's listing requirements. The presence of locked-in shares for promoters is typical for newly listed companies to ensure promoter commitment. No encumbrances or dilutive securities are present, indicating a clean capital structure post-listing.
