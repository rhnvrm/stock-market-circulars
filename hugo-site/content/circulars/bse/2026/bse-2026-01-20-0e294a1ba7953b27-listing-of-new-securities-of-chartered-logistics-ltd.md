## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of new securities following warrant conversion for Chartered Logistics Ltd. The company issued 35 lakh shares to non-promoters, increasing equity base by approximately 27.5% (assuming previous base of ~127 lakh shares based on distinctive numbering). The lock-in periods provide temporary supply constraints until mid-2026. Limited market impact expected due to the company's relatively small size and the phased lock-in release structure.
