## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that from 24 February 2026, trades in the specified NCD will be executed at the reduced face value of Rs. 6,666.67 per debenture.
- Members should update their systems and inform relevant clients holding this instrument.

## Impact Assessment

Impact is limited to holders of the Unigold Finance Limited NCD (ISIN: INE0O7U07012). The part redemption reduces the face value of each debenture to Rs. 6,666.67, reflecting a partial return of principal to investors. Broader market impact is negligible as this is a privately placed instrument with a narrow investor base.
