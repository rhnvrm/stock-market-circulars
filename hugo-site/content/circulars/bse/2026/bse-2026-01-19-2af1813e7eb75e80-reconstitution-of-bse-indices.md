## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Index reconstitution typically triggers rebalancing activity from passive funds and ETFs tracking these indices. The addition of ICICI Prudential AMC and Meesho to large-cap indices may result in increased trading volumes and buying pressure for these securities as index funds adjust their holdings.

**Operational Impact**: Fund managers tracking BSE Allcap, LargeCap, LargeMidCap, Financial Services, Consumer Discretionary, and REITs/InvITs indices must execute portfolio rebalancing by the effective date. The absence of deletions simplifies the transition.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in index-linked products will gain exposure to the newly added constituents, reflecting the evolving composition of the Indian equity market and real estate investment sector.
