  Structure Amendment

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular detailing proposed amendments to the security structure governing the debentures (ISIN: INE741X07077, Scrip Code: 977168) of Equinox India Infraestate Limited (formerly Indiabulls Infraestate Limited). The amendment replaces the existing Common Security Trustee arrangement and broad pari passu charges with a restructured set of specific, first-ranking security interests under a Debenture Trustee.

## Key Points

- Company: Equinox India Infraestate Limited (formerly Indiabulls Infraestate Limited)
- Scrip Code / ISIN: 977168 / INE741X07077
- The security structure for outstanding debentures is being materially amended
- Security will now be held in favour of the Debenture Trustee (replacing the Common Security Trustee)
- Existing pari passu charges over immovable and movable assets of the Obligors are being replaced with specific, project-linked security interests
- New security package focuses on the Blu Project assets and equity pledges of subsidiary entities

## Regulatory Changes

**Existing Provision:** Security was structured as first ranking pari passu charges (shared with parties to the Summit Debentures) over:
- All immovable assets (present and future) of the Obligors including Mortgaged Properties
- All movable assets and bank accounts (present and future) of the Obligors (excluding HoldCo)
- Held in favour of the Common Security Trustee

**Proposed Amendment:** Security will now be held by the Debenture Trustee and consist of:
- (a) First ranking Security Interest over assets related to the Blu Project and Blu Project Property (excluding Excluded Assets)
- (b) First ranking Pledge over 99.9997% of total fully paid-up equity share capital and voting rights of the Company (fully diluted basis)
- (c) First ranking Pledge over 99.9994% of total fully paid-up equity share capital and voting rights of Spero (fully diluted basis)
- (d) Contractual comforts via corporate guarantees from Spero and HoldCo
- (e) First ranking Security Interest over Subordination Receivables (receivables of Subordinated Loans extended to Spero and the Company)
- (f) Undated Cheques issued by HoldCo (details in full document)

## Compliance Requirements

- Existing debenture holders should review the full Annexure A for the complete list of proposed amendments
- Debenture Trustees and Obligors must execute revised transaction documents reflecting the new security structure
- All Obligors under the Transaction Documents are bound by the restructured security and performance obligations

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: 27 February 2026
- Effective date of amendments: As per the revised Debenture Trust Deed and Transaction Documents (refer to full circular for specific timelines)

## Impact Assessment

The restructuring of the security package has medium impact on existing debenture holders. Key considerations include:
- **Positive:** Security is now more clearly defined and ring-fenced around specific assets (Blu Project), reducing ambiguity
- **Risk:** Removal of broad pari passu charge over all Obligor assets may reduce recourse for holders if Blu Project assets are insufficient
- **Structural change:** Shift from Common Security Trustee to Debenture Trustee simplifies the security administration but eliminates shared security pooling with Summit Debenture holders
- **Equity pledges:** High percentage pledges (99.9997% and 99.9994%) over subsidiaries provide meaningful collateral
- Debenture holders and market participants should assess the adequacy of the new security package relative to outstanding obligations
