## Summary

BSE Notice No. 20260224-1 informs trading members that the equity shares of Fractal Industries Limited (SME IPO, Scrip Code: 544707) will be moved from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to the Rolling segment (M Group), effective March 11, 2026. This is a continuation of the earlier notice dated February 23, 2026 (Notice No. 20260223-23).

## Key Points

- Fractal Industries Limited (Scrip Code: 544707) is currently trading in the Trade for Trade segment under MT Group.
- Effective Wednesday, March 11, 2026, the scrip will be transferred to the Rolling segment under M Group.
- This change applies to the SME IPO equity shares of the company.
- Contact person for queries: Mr. Anurag Jain, Tel: 022-2272 8822.

## Regulatory Changes

The scrip transitions from the Trade for Trade (MT Group) settlement mechanism to the standard Rolling segment (M Group). In the Trade for Trade segment, each trade results in mandatory delivery; the move to Rolling settlement allows for netting and intraday trading, subject to M Group regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems and client records to reflect the group change for Scrip Code 544707 effective March 11, 2026.
- Members should notify clients trading in this scrip about the change in settlement type and applicable margins/limits under the M Group.

## Important Dates

- **February 23, 2026**: Original notice issued (Notice No. 20260223-23).
- **February 24, 2026**: Continuation notice issued (Notice No. 20260224-1).
- **March 11, 2026**: Effective date of transfer from MT Group to M Group (Rolling segment).

## Impact Assessment

The transfer from Trade for Trade (MT Group) to Rolling segment (M Group) generally signals improved liquidity and normalisation of trading conditions for Fractal Industries Limited. Traders will no longer be required to mandatorily deliver/receive shares for each transaction; netting within a settlement cycle becomes permissible. This change is standard practice for SME IPO scrips after an initial mandatory Trade for Trade period and is expected to improve price discovery and trading volumes.
