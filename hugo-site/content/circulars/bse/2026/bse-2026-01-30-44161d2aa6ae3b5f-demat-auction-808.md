## Summary

BSE has issued a demat auction notification for Settlement No. 808 dated January 30, 2026. The circular lists securities that are being put up for auction due to delivery shortages from the settlement. The auction involves 99 different scrips with varying quantities ranging from 1 share to 86,769 shares.

- Highest quantity: HINDUSTAN CO (86,769 shares)
- Includes major stocks like Tata Steel (611 shares), Hindalco (50 shares), Larsen & Toubro (20 shares), and Bharat Heavy (25 shares)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational auction process as per existing BSE regulations for handling delivery shortages.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The auction involves 99 securities with varying quantities. While most quantities are small, some scrips have substantial volumes (e.g., Hindustan Copper with 86,769 shares, Paras Petrofils with 18,980 shares).

**Operational Impact**: Affects brokers and trading members who failed to deliver securities in Settlement 808. These members will need to participate in the auction to close out their obligations, potentially at unfavorable prices.

**Trading Impact**: Securities listed in the auction may experience temporary price volatility during the auction process. Buyers in the original settlement may face delays in receiving their securities until auction settlement is completed.
