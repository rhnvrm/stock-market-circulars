The circular provides detailed settlement schedules for both T+1 and T+0 settlement cycles, including settlement numbers, trading dates, pay-in/pay-out dates, and auction schedules. Key adjustment made for settlement holiday on January 15, 2026, with settlements DR-798 and DR-799 having pay-in/pay-out on January 16, 2026.

## Key Points

- Settlement schedule covers period from January 1-31, 2026 for cash segment
- Includes both T+1 rolling settlement cycle (DR-789 to DR-809) and T+0 settlement cycle (DR-484 to DR-504)
- Total 21 regular settlements and 21 auction settlements scheduled for T+1 cycle
- Total 20 settlements scheduled for T+0 cycle (no DR-494 settlement listed, likely due to January 15 holiday)
- Settlement numbers for depository purposes: 2526789 to 2526809 (T+1) and 2526484 to 2526504 (T+0)
- Revised pay-in/pay-out dates marked with @ symbol for settlements affected by January 15 holiday
- OTR (Off-Trade Reference) allocation deadline: 8:00 PM on T day
- OTR confirmation by custodians deadline: 7:30 AM on T+1 day

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine operational schedule publication with revisions to accommodate the settlement holiday.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must enter 6A/7A data on trading date as per schedule
- Custodians must confirm 6A/7A data by specified dates
- Members must adhere to pay-in/pay-out timelines for both securities and funds
- Auction offers must be submitted on specified auction settlement dates
- OTR allocation entries must be completed by members by 8:00 PM on trade date
- OTR confirmation (take-up entry) must be done by custodians by 7:30 AM on T+1 day
- All participants must note revised settlement dates for settlements around January 15, 2026

## Important Dates

- **January 1-31, 2026**: Trading period covered by this settlement schedule
- **January 15, 2026**: Settlement holiday (affects settlements DR-798 and DR-799)
- **January 16, 2026**: Pay-in/pay-out for both DR-798 (trading date Jan 14) and DR-799 (trading date Jan 15)
- **First T+1 Settlement**: DR-789 with trading date January 1, pay-in/pay-out January 2
- **Last T+1 Settlement**: DR-809 with trading date January 30, pay-in/pay-out February 2
- **First T+0 Settlement**: DR-484 with trading date January 1
- **Last T+0 Settlement**: DR-504 with trading date January 30
- **Weekend/Holiday Gaps**: January 4, 10-11, 18, 25-26, 31 (non-trading days)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - All market participants including brokers, custodians, clearing members, and depositories must align their settlement operations with this revised schedule. The consolidation of two settlements (DR-798 and DR-799) for pay-in/pay-out on January 16 due to the January 15 holiday requires careful operational planning to manage increased settlement volumes on that date.

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine settlement calendar with no changes to settlement mechanics or cycles. However, participants must ensure adequate liquidity and securities availability for January 16 when two settlements converge.

**System Impact**: Medium - Settlement systems, risk management systems, and clearing platforms must be configured with the correct settlement numbers and dates. The auction settlement schedules (RA-789 to RA-809) must be properly mapped to corresponding delivery settlements.

**Timeline Planning**: Critical for back-office operations to schedule staff and resources appropriately, especially around the January 15 holiday period and the subsequent consolidated settlement on January 16.
