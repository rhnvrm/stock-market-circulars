## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and market participants must apply revised ST-ASM conditions (enhanced margins, tightened price bands) for newly added securities from February 26, 2026
- Securities exiting ST-ASM revert to normal trading conditions unless subject to another surveillance framework (LT-ASM, GSM, ESM, Trade-for-Trade, or Pledge Framework)
- KRN Heat Exchanger (544263) is included as per NSE shortlisting criteria
- Vanta Bioscience (540729) and Marc Loire Fashions (544437) are SME scrips subject to SME-specific ST-ASM rules

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 25, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 26, 2026 — all additions, stage changes, and removals take effect

## Impact Assessment

The newly added securities will face enhanced surveillance conditions including tighter price bands and higher margin requirements, which typically reduces liquidity and increases trading costs for investors. Engineers India Ltd (532178) and RACL Geartech Ltd (520073) — relatively higher-profile names — exiting ST-ASM may see improved trading sentiment. The consolidated list (Annexure III) reflects the full universe of securities currently under ST-ASM, providing market participants a complete reference for compliance and risk management purposes.
