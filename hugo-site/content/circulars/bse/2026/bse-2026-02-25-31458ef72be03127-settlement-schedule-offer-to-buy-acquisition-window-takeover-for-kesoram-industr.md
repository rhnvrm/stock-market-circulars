## Impact Assessment

This circular directly affects brokers (Members) and Custodians participating in the takeover offer for Kesoram Industries Limited. Failure to complete early pay-in before the OTB bidding window closes may result in bid rejection or settlement failure. Investors tendering shares in the takeover must coordinate with their brokers well ahead of March 12, 2026. The settlement process follows established ICCL guidelines, minimising systemic risk, but operational discipline around timing is critical.
