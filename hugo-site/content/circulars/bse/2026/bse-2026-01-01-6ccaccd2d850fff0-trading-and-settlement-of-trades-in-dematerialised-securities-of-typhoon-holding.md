  (Scrip Code: 512307)'

## Summary

Typhoon Holdings Ltd (scrip code: 512307) has signed depository agreements with both depositories, enabling dematerialised trading and settlement. The scrip will trade in Trade to Trade segment with compulsory demat settlement. Key changes effective January 2, 2026 include market lot reduction from 100 to 1 share and group migration from ZY to Z. New ISIN is INE2L3M01012. Currently, trading remains suspended; revised parameters apply upon revocation.

## Key Points

- Company has signed agreements with both depositories for dematerialised securities
- Trading in Trade to Trade segment for reasons other than depository non-signing
- Compulsory demat settlement required for all trades
- Market lot: 1 equity share (reduced from 100 shares)
- Netting not allowed in the scrip
- Shortages will be directly closed-out
- New ISIN: INE2L3M01012
- Group change: ZY to Z
- Trading currently under suspension; changes applicable upon revocation

## Regulatory Changes

The scrip transitions to compulsory dematerialised settlement following depository agreement execution. Group classification changes from ZY to Z, and market lot size reduces from 100 shares to 1 share per lot effective January 2, 2026.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must settle all trades in compulsory demat form
- No netting permitted in this scrip
- All trades executed in market lot of 1 equity share
- Shortages to be directly closed-out without alternative settlement
- Members must update systems for revised group and market lot parameters

## Important Dates

- **January 1, 2026**: Circular notification date
- **January 2, 2026**: Effective date for revised group (Z) and market lot (1 share) parameters

## Impact Assessment

The market lot reduction from 100 to 1 share significantly lowers the minimum investment threshold, potentially increasing retail accessibility once trading resumes. The Trade to Trade classification with no netting and direct close-out of shortages imposes stricter settlement discipline. Group migration from ZY to Z indicates improved regulatory standing post-depository agreements. Currently suspended trading status means immediate market impact is neutral, with changes activating upon revocation.
