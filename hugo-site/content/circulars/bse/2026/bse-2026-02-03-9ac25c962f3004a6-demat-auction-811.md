## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 142 securities with varying quantities. While most quantities are relatively small, some scrips have substantial amounts (e.g., Spright Agro with 408,383 shares, Rajnish Wellness with 50,001 shares) which could impact price discovery during the auction.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members with delivery shortfalls in these securities will need to participate in the auction, potentially at unfavorable prices. This serves as an enforcement mechanism for delivery obligations.

**Participant Impact:** Brokers and their clients who failed to deliver these securities will face compulsory auction purchases, potentially resulting in financial losses if auction prices are higher than the original trade prices.
