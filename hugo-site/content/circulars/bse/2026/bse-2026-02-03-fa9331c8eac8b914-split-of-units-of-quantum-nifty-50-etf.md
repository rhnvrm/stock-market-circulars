- **February 13, 2026**: Trading commences with new face value of Re. 1/-

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The unit split makes the ETF more accessible to retail investors by reducing the per-unit price, potentially increasing liquidity and trading activity.

**Investor Impact**: Existing unit holders will see their number of units increase by 10 times while the per-unit value decreases proportionally. The total investment value remains unchanged. Investors should track the new ISIN once announced for accurate portfolio tracking.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems and depository participants need to update records to reflect the new face value and ISIN. The split is executed on a single day (record date and ex-date are the same), simplifying the transition.
