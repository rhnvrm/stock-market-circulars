## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The preferential issue represents a substantial capital raise for ONIX SOLAR ENERGY LIMITED. The allotment exclusively to promoters indicates strong promoter commitment and confidence in the company's prospects. However, this significantly increases the share capital and may lead to dilution concerns for existing public shareholders.

**Trading Impact**: With 1.85 crore new shares entering circulation from January 8, 2026, the stock may experience increased liquidity. The extended lock-in periods (until 2026 and 2027) ensure that promoter shares remain locked, providing stability. Only after lock-in expiry will the full float impact be realized.

**Corporate Action**: The substantial premium of Rs. 254 over face value suggests the company's strong valuation and growth prospects, justifying the high issue price to promoters.
