## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The surveillance framework affects 12 securities, which may experience reduced liquidity and increased volatility. Institutional investors typically reduce exposure to high-encumbrance stocks.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding these securities should be aware of heightened risks associated with high promoter pledging, including potential forced selling if pledged shares are invoked.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to update their surveillance systems and risk management frameworks to account for these securities. Enhanced monitoring and margin requirements may apply.

**Risk Factors:** High promoter encumbrance indicates potential financial stress and could lead to change in control if pledged shares are invoked by lenders. This framework serves as an early warning system for market participants.
