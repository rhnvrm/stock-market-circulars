title: Update on Additional Margin in All Variants of Gold and Silver
---

## Summary

Indian Clearing Corporation Limited (ICCL) has issued a modification to circular 20260128-2, implementing additional margin requirements on all variants of Gold and Silver futures contracts. The additional margins will be applied in two phases: an initial increase effective February 5, 2026 (beginning of day), followed by a further increase on February 6, 2026 (beginning of day). This action is part of ICCL's periodic review of risk management measures to mitigate systemic risk in the commodity derivatives segment.

## Key Points

- Additional margin of 1.00% imposed on Gold futures (all variants) effective February 5, 2026 BOD
- Additional margin of 4.50% imposed on Silver futures (all variants) effective February 5, 2026 BOD
- Gold futures additional margin increased to 3.00% (total) effective February 6, 2026 BOD
- Silver futures additional margin increased to 7.00% (total) effective February 6, 2026 BOD
- Applies to all clearing members and participants in commodity derivatives segment
- Modifies earlier circular no. 20260128-2 dated January 2, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

ICCL is implementing a phased margin increase as part of its risk management framework:

**Phase 1 - February 5, 2026 (BOD):**
- Gold (all variants): 1.00% additional margin
- Silver (all variants): 4.50% additional margin

**Phase 2 - February 6, 2026 (BOD):**
- Gold (all variants): 3.00% additional margin (increase of 2.00%)
- Silver (all variants): 7.00% additional margin (increase of 2.50%)

These margins are imposed in accordance with the Rules, Bye-laws, and Regulations of ICCL.

## Compliance Requirements

- All clearing members and participants must ensure adequate margin funds are available to meet the increased requirements
- Members must account for the phased implementation with different margin levels on February 5 and February 6, 2026
- Members should update their risk management systems and client communication to reflect the new margin structure
- Compliance is mandatory for all Gold and Silver futures contracts across all variants

## Important Dates

- **February 5, 2026 (BOD)**: Initial additional margin implemented - Gold 1.00%, Silver 4.50%
- **February 6, 2026 (BOD)**: Enhanced additional margin implemented - Gold 3.00%, Silver 7.00%
- **Reference Date**: January 2, 2026 - Original circular no. 20260128-2 being modified

## Impact Assessment

**Capital Requirements**: Members trading in gold and silver futures will need to allocate significantly higher margins, particularly for silver positions where the margin increases by 7%. This will impact working capital requirements and position sizing.

**Trading Costs**: The margin increase effectively raises the cost of maintaining futures positions, which may lead to reduced leverage and altered trading strategies.

**Market Liquidity**: Higher margin requirements could potentially reduce market participation and liquidity in gold and silver futures as traders face increased capital constraints.

**Risk Mitigation**: The phased approach allows members time to adjust positions and arrange additional capital while achieving ICCL's objective of reducing systemic risk exposure in precious metals derivatives.
