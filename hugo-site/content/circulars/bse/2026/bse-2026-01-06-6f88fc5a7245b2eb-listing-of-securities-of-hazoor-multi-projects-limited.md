## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative listing notification for a small preferential allotment of shares following warrant conversion. The impact is minimal and limited to Hazoor Multi Projects Limited and its Non-Promoter allottee. The lock-in period until July 29, 2026 means these shares will not be available for trading in the market for approximately 7 months, preventing any immediate supply-side impact on the stock's liquidity or price.
