- Turnover details and debit amounts will be available in EXTRANET (current date > EQ > Transaction) on or before **March 04, 2026**.
- GST at 18% is calculated on the amount in **column 26 of the TF2A file**.
- Invoices for February 2026 will be available in EXTRANET by **March 04, 2026**, under path: Periodic files > 2026 > ZIP file named `SEBIFEB2026.Member_Code`.

- Reference notice: **Exchange Notice No. 20260130-2**.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This notice reaffirms the existing framework under which 18% GST applies to SEBI turnover fees across all segments since July 18, 2022.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure **sufficient funds** are maintained in their settlement (valan) account or Exchange dues account prior to March 05, 2026.
- Members should download and verify turnover fee files from EXTRANET before the debit date.
- GST liability should be confirmed against column 26 of the TF2A file.
- Relevant EXTRANET fee files to review: TF2Ammyy, TF2Bmmyy, TF2Cmmyy, TF2Dmmyy, TF2Emmyy, TF2Fmmyy, TF2Gmmyy, TF2Hmmyy, TF2Immyy, TF2Jmmyy (where `mmyy` = month and year).

## Important Dates

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| July 18, 2022 | GST at 18% on SEBI turnover fees effective from this date |
| March 04, 2026 | Turnover details and invoices available in EXTRANET |
| March 05, 2026 | SEBI turnover fees + GST debited from settlement/Exchange dues accounts |

## Impact Assessment

This is a recurring monthly compliance obligation affecting all trading members on BSE across all segments. The operational impact is moderate — members need to proactively check EXTRANET for their fee computations and ensure adequate liquidity in settlement accounts to avoid any shortfall. No changes to rates or processes are introduced; this serves as a reminder for February 2026 settlement. Members with high trading volumes across multiple segments should pay particular attention to the aggregate fee computation across all applicable TF2 files.
