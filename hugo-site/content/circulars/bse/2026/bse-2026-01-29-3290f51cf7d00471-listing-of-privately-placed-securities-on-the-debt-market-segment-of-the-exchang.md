## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine administrative circular informing trading members about new debt instrument listings. The commercial papers provide short-term debt investment options for institutional investors.

**Liquidity Impact**: Limited impact on overall market liquidity. Commercial papers are typically held till maturity and have lower trading volumes compared to equity securities.

**Issuer Profile**: The issuers represent diverse financial sectors including wealth management (Julius Baer, Nuvama), non-banking finance (Bajaj Finance, Poonawalla Fincorp), and conglomerate holdings (Birla Group), all with high credit ratings indicating low default risk.
