## Securities Moving to GSM Stage II

| Security Code | ISIN | Security Name |
|---|---|---|
| 504375 | INE459E01012 | Softbpo Global Services Ltd. |
| 522245 | INE079L01013 | Iykot Hitech Toolroom Ltd. |
| 523896 | INE316O01021 | Avi Products India Limited |
| 531327 | INE442C01012 | Charms Industries Ltd. |
| 531458 | INE109B01019 | Boston Bio Systems Ltd. |
| 531971 | INE167F01018 | Hari Govind International Ltd. |

## Securities Moving to GSM Stage III

| Security Code | ISIN | Security Name |
|---|---|---|
| 531272 | INE526C01012 | Nikki Global Finance Ltd. |

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework is a surveillance mechanism implemented by stock exchanges to monitor securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or volatility. Movement to higher stages results in additional compliance requirements and trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Enhanced disclosure obligations for listed companies in GSM
- Additional surveillance by exchange on trading patterns
- Potential restrictions on trading including reduced price bands or trade-for-trade settlement
- Investors should exercise caution when trading in securities under GSM

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: As per the circular dated January 22, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The movement of securities into higher GSM stages indicates that these stocks have exhibited characteristics warranting increased surveillance, such as unusual price volatility or sharp movements. For investors, this means:

- Reduced liquidity due to potential trading restrictions
- Heightened risk perception
- Possible requirement for higher margins
- Securities may be subject to trade-for-trade settlement or reduced price bands depending on GSM stage

Investors holding or considering these securities should be aware of the increased surveillance and associated trading restrictions. The movement to Stage III for Nikki Global Finance Ltd. represents a particularly elevated level of concern.
