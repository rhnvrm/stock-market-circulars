  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced on or before the Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects existing shareholders of AVASARA FINANCE LIMITED who wish to participate in the rights issue or trade their entitlements. The 6-day renunciation window (January 09-14) provides a limited timeframe for secondary market trading of REs.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure proper client communication and include mandatory disclaimers in contract notes. The trade-for-trade settlement and demat-only requirement necessitate specific operational handling.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders must act within the defined timeframe to either subscribe, renounce, or trade their rights entitlements, otherwise they will forfeit the entitlements after January 19, 2026.
