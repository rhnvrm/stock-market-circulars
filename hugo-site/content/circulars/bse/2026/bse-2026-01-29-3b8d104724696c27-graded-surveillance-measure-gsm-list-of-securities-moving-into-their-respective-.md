## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework applies progressive surveillance stages to securities based on specific criteria. Higher stages typically involve stricter trading restrictions, additional disclosure requirements, and enhanced monitoring to protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of the GSM stage applicable to these securities
- Trading in these securities will be subject to stage-specific restrictions
- Investors should exercise additional caution when trading in GSM securities
- Brokers and trading members must ensure compliance with GSM-specific requirements

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: January 29, 2026
- Effective Date: As per exchange notification

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Securities in higher GSM stages face increased surveillance and potential trading restrictions including price bands, trade-for-trade settlement, and periodic call auctions.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of enhanced risk factors and potential liquidity constraints associated with GSM securities.

**Market Impact:** Limited impact on overall market operations as only five securities are affected. However, shareholders of these specific companies may experience reduced trading flexibility.
