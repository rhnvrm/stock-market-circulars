## Summary

BSE has published the Demat Auction list for Settlement No. 825 dated February 23, 2026. The auction covers securities from approximately 190 scrips across various sectors where delivery obligations were not met by sellers in the normal settlement cycle.

## Key Points

- Settlement No. 825 demat auction conducted on February 23, 2026
- Approximately 190 scrips listed for auction covering a wide range of sectors
- Notable large-quantity lots include: NOVARTIS IND (4,031 shares), Vistar Amar (4,002 shares), MRC AGROTECH (3,000 shares), BGIL FILMS (3,602 shares), SSPDL LTD (2,066 shares), URJA GLOBAL (2,000 shares), JINDAL POLY (2,000 shares), RICO AUTO IN (1,001 shares)
- Sectors represented include banking, pharmaceuticals, energy, infrastructure, IT, FMCG, and manufacturing
- Auction covers both large-cap and small/mid-cap securities

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational notice under BSE's settlement and auction framework for handling non-delivered securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers and market participants with short delivery positions in the listed scrips must participate in or comply with the auction settlement process
- Buyers of auctioned securities will receive delivery through BSE's auction mechanism
- Sellers who failed to deliver will be required to pay the auction price differential as penalty

## Important Dates

- **Auction Date:** February 23, 2026
- **Settlement Number:** 825

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine demat auction covering failed deliveries from a prior settlement cycle. The impact is limited to counterparties with short delivery positions in the listed scrips. The auction spans a broad cross-section of the market including blue-chip names (HDFC Bank, Infosys, Reliance Industries, SBI, Tata Steel, Wipro), indicating widespread but individually small delivery failures. Large-quantity lots in smaller scrips (e.g., NOVARTIS IND at 4,031 shares, BGIL FILMS at 3,602 shares) may see localized price impact during the auction session. Overall market impact is low.
