**Liquidity**: Immediate tradable float of 1,376,000 shares (19% of listed securities), with additional tranches becoming tradable progressively through 2029.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders holding locked-in securities must wait until respective expiry dates before trading. The staggered unlock schedule may prevent sudden supply shocks to the stock price.
