## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment to promoters following warrant conversion increases the total share capital of Piccadily Agro Industries Ltd by 6,36,942 shares. The three-year lock-in period prevents immediate trading by promoters, limiting short-term supply impact. The shares are fungible with existing equity and carry identical rights. Market impact is confined to this single scrip with no broader implications for trading operations or market structure.
