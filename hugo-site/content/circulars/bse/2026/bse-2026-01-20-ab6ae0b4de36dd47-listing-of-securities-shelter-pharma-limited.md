Limited market impact expected as this is a routine listing event. The preferential allotment of 861,000 shares represents capital raising through warrant conversion. All shares are subject to lock-in periods extending until mid-August 2026, which will prevent immediate trading and limit liquidity impact. The shares rank equally with existing equity shares, maintaining uniform shareholder rights.
