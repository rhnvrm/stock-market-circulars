## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notice with minimal broader market impact. The scheme has a small float of 39,989 units at Rs. 10 per unit (total corpus ~Rs. 3.99 lakh), making it a niche instrument. It is a close-ended scheme maturing in 108 days from allotment (approximately early June 2026), so secondary market liquidity is expected to be limited. Impact is confined to existing unit holders of this specific FMP series who may wish to exit via the exchange before maturity.
