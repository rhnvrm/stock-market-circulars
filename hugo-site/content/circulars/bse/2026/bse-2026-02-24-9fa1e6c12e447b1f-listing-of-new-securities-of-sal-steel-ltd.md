## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 1,92,50,000 shares to S.A.L. Steel Ltd.'s tradeable equity base, representing a preferential allotment to non-promoters. While the shares are listed, the full lock-in on all newly issued shares until August 30, 2027 means no additional selling pressure in the near term. Existing shareholders may experience dilution in earnings per share metrics. The allotment at Rs. 18/- (face value Rs. 10/-) reflects a modest premium, which may be relevant for price discovery context.
