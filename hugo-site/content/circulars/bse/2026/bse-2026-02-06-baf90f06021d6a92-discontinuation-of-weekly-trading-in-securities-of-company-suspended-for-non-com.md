title: Discontinuation of Weekly Trading for Suspended Companies
---

## Summary

BSE announces the discontinuation of weekly trading facility for Procal Electronics India Ltd (Scrip Code: 526009) and Satiate Agri Ltd (Scrip Code: 524546) effective February 24, 2026. These companies were previously allowed to trade on a Trade for Trade basis in the "Z" group on the first trading day of every week following their suspension for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations. The mandated six-month period has now been completed.

## Key Points

- Two companies affected: Procal Electronics India Ltd (526009) and Satiate Agri Ltd (524546)
- Weekly trading facility was provided after initial 15-day suspension period
- Trading was allowed on Trade for Trade basis in "Z" group on first trading day of each week
- Six-month period as per SEBI Master Circular has been completed
- Discontinuation follows SEBI's Standard Operating Procedure for suspension and revocation

## Regulatory Changes

This action is pursuant to SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024, Chapter-VII(A) covering Penal Actions for Non-Compliance. The circular implements the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for suspension and revocation of equity shares for non-compliance with SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must cease trading in these securities from February 24, 2026
- No trading will be permitted even on weekly basis after the discontinuation date
- Companies remain suspended for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations
- Queries should be directed to bse.soplodr@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 06, 2026
- **Reference Circular**: Exchange Notice No. 20250708-42 dated July 08, 2025
- **Discontinuation Effective Date**: February 24, 2026
- **Six-Month Period**: Completed as of discontinuation date

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact**: The discontinuation eliminates the last trading opportunity for investors holding shares in these suspended companies. After February 24, 2026, no trading will be possible until the companies resolve their compliance issues and the suspension is revoked. Existing shareholders will have no market mechanism to exit their positions. This represents the final stage of escalated penal action for continued non-compliance with listing obligations.
