**Operational Impact:** Low - Standard operational procedure for trading members already familiar with the NCB-GSec bidding platform. No changes to existing systems or processes.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Provides opportunity for investors to participate in government securities auction with guaranteed allocation (subject to limits) without competing on yield with institutional investors. The three different tenors (91, 182, 364 days) offer flexibility for short-term investment strategies.
