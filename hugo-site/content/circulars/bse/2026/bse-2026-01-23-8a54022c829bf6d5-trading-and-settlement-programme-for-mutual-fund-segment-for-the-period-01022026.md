- Liquid fund subscriptions follow T+0 payout cycle (same-day settlement)
- Funds payout to AMCs for non-liquid transactions happens before 3:00 PM on T day
- NFO scheme payouts processed on T day based on funds confirmation received by ICCL till 6:00 PM
- Redemption settlements vary by scheme TAT (T1 through T10 cycles)
- February 19, 2026 included in redemption schedule but excluded from liquid fund subscription schedule

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine operational schedule circular.

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine operational circular that ensures smooth functioning of the mutual fund trading platform.

**Operational Impact**: Medium for mutual fund intermediaries and AMCs who need to plan their settlement operations, fund transfers, and back-office processes according to this schedule.
