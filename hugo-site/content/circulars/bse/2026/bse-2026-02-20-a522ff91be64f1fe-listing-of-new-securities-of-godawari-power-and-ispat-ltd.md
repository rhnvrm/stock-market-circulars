## Summary

BSE has listed 13,72,500 new equity shares of Godawari Power and Ispat Ltd. (Scrip Code: 532734) on a preferential basis, issued pursuant to the conversion of warrants to non-promoters. These shares are permitted to trade on the Exchange with effect from Monday, February 23, 2026.

## Key Points

- 13,72,500 equity shares of Re. 1/- each issued at a premium of Rs. 244/- (issue price Rs. 245/-) to non-promoters on a preferential basis
- Shares issued pursuant to conversion of warrants
- New shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares of the company
- Distribution numbers: 669795409 to 671167908
- ISIN: INE177H01039
- All 13,72,500 shares are subject to lock-in until October 10, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification for newly allotted securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed that the new securities are listed and permitted to trade from February 23, 2026
- Lock-in restriction applies to all 13,72,500 shares (dist. nos. 669795409–671167908) until October 10, 2026; these shares cannot be traded during the lock-in period

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** January 7, 2026
- **Trading Effective From:** February 23, 2026 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Expiry:** October 10, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing is routine and of low market impact. All newly issued shares are under lock-in until October 10, 2026, meaning they will not add to tradeable float immediately. The issue price of Rs. 245/- per share (face value Re. 1/- + premium of Rs. 244/-) provides a reference point for market participants. The addition of 13,72,500 shares represents a modest dilution relative to the company's existing share capital.
