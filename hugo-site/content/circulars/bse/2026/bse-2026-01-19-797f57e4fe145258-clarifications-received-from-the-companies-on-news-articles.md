## Summary

BSE issued a circular containing clarifications from two companies responding to rumor verification letters regarding news articles. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited denied speculation about a USD 10 billion acquisition of Organon, stating the information is speculative with no material event requiring disclosure. Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited clarified that post-sale of assets, the company's financials are drawn as not a going concern and the company is not aware of current owners' plans.

## Key Points

- Sun Pharma responded to news article about alleged USD 10 billion Organon acquisition published on news18.com on January 19, 2026
- Sun Pharma stated the acquisition information is speculative in nature
- Sun Pharma confirmed no material event/information requiring disclosure under Regulation 30 of Listing Regulations
- Nagarjuna Fertilizers referenced previous disclosure dated July 12, 2024, regarding sale of assets
- Nagarjuna Fertilizers confirmed company financials drawn as not a going concern post-asset sale
- Nagarjuna Fertilizers stated company not aware of current owners' plans or activities
- Both companies confirmed adherence to disclosure requirements under SEBI Listing Regulations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must respond to BSE rumor verification letters regarding news articles
- Companies must clarify whether speculative news contains material information requiring disclosure under Regulation 30
- Companies must maintain adherence to SEBI Listing Regulations disclosure standards
- Companies must inform stock exchanges of any material events as required under Regulation 30

## Important Dates

- January 19, 2026: Date of BSE rumor verification letter to Sun Pharma
- January 19, 2026: Date of Sun Pharma's response
- January 19, 2026: Date of Nagarjuna Fertilizers' response
- July 12, 2024: Date of Nagarjuna Fertilizers' previous disclosure on asset sale (referenced)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as both clarifications dismiss speculative news without confirming any material events. Sun Pharma's denial of acquisition rumors provides clarity to investors that no such transaction is underway. Nagarjuna Fertilizers' clarification reiterates its non-going concern status previously disclosed, with no new information. The circular serves routine disclosure compliance purposes rather than indicating any material corporate developments.
