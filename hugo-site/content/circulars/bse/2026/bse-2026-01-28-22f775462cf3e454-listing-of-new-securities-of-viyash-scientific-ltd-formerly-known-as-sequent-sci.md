**Market Impact**: The listing of over 18 crore new equity shares represents significant dilution for existing shareholders of Viyash Scientific Ltd. The composite amalgamation scheme consolidates operations of 10 pharmaceutical and life sciences entities into one entity, which may lead to operational synergies and streamlined operations.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will experience dilution due to the substantial increase in share capital. However, the consolidation of multiple entities may create long-term value through economies of scale, integrated operations, and elimination of inter-company complexities.

**Liquidity Impact**: The significant increase in the number of shares outstanding (from distinctive numbers range) will substantially improve stock liquidity and may attract increased trading volumes.

**Operational Impact**: The amalgamation of pharmaceutical manufacturing, research, and life sciences entities suggests strategic consolidation in the sector, potentially creating a more diversified and robust pharmaceutical company.
