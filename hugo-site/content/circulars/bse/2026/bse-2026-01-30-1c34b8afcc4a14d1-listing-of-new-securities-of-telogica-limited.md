## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative filing with minimal market impact. The submission of distinctive numbers and lock-in details is a standard post-allotment compliance requirement. The lock-in periods indicate these are likely promoter or strategic investor holdings that will remain restricted until 2026-2027. No immediate trading impact expected as these shares are subject to lock-in restrictions.
