- Bidding is available via the NCB-GSec module at https://ibbs.bseindia.com
- All three T-Bills are new issuances (not reissues)

## Impact Assessment

This circular is relevant primarily to debt market participants and trading members who engage in government securities auctions. The combined issue size of ₹34,000 crore across three T-Bill tenors indicates significant short-term government borrowing activity. The non-competitive bidding mechanism allows smaller participants to invest in T-Bills without quoting a specific yield, providing broader market access. Equity markets are not directly affected. Members dealing in debt instruments should ensure timely registration on the iBBS platform and adhere to the bid collection deadlines.
