## Summary

Accord Transformer and Switchgear Limited has filed its shareholding pattern with BSE under Regulation 31(1)(b) for the quarter ending February 26, 2026, in connection with the listing of its equity shares. The company has a total of 20,573,289 equity shares held by 530 shareholders.

## Key Points

- Total issued equity shares: 20,573,289
- Promoter & Promoter Group: 12,750,000 shares (61.97%), held by 2 shareholders
- Public shareholding: 7,823,289 shares (38.03%), held by 528 shareholders
- Shares held in dematerialised form: 16,595,289 (80.66% of total)
- No partly paid-up shares issued
- No convertible securities or warrants outstanding
- No depository receipts issued against shares
- Promoter shares are locked-in; no pledge or encumbrance on promoter shares
- Public category demat shares: 3,845,289 (49.15% of public holding)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard disclosure filing under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 — Regulation 31(1)(b).

## Compliance Requirements

- Filed by: Accord Transformer and Switchgear Limited (Listed Entity)
- Filing type: Shareholding Pattern under Reg. 31(1)(b)
- The company has declared 'Yes' to locked-in shares for promoters and 'No' to all other special categories (partly paid, convertibles, DRs, pledge/encumbrance), meaning zero values apply to those columns by default.

## Important Dates

- Quarter ending date: February 26, 2026
- Filing date: February 27, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine post-listing disclosure with no immediate market impact. The promoter holding of ~62% is above the minimum threshold, and the absence of pledged shares or convertible securities indicates a clean capital structure. The relatively low demat percentage in the public category (49.15%) may warrant attention for future liquidity, but poses no immediate concern.
