title: Introduction of Daily STP for NJ Mutual Fund on BSE StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

NJ Mutual Fund has introduced a "Daily" frequency option under its Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) facility, effective February 2, 2026. This enhancement allows investors to transfer fixed amounts on a daily basis from an eligible source scheme to an eligible target scheme on the BSE StAR MF Platform. The minimum transfer amount is Rs. 500 with a minimum of 12 installments required.

## Key Points

- Daily STP frequency introduced as an addition to existing STP options
- Minimum transfer amount: Rs. 500 (and multiples of Re. 1 thereafter)
- For ELSS target schemes: amounts must be in multiples of Rs. 500 only
- Minimum installments required: 12
- STP cycle operates on all business days
- Default start date: 5th business day after submission if not specified by investor
- Perpetual end date unless three consecutive installments fail
- Trustees/AMC reserve the right to modify or discontinue the facility

## Regulatory Changes

This notice-cum-addendum updates the Scheme Information Document (SID), Key Information Memorandum (KIM), and Statement of Additional Information (SAI) of all NJ Mutual Fund schemes to reflect the new Daily STP facility. All other existing terms and conditions remain unchanged.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors must maintain sufficient balance in source scheme for daily transfers
- STP registration will automatically cease after three consecutive installment failures
- All existing STP terms and conditions continue to apply
- Investors can specify custom start and end dates, otherwise defaults apply

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 28, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 2, 2026 (Daily STP facility becomes operational)
- **Default Start Date**: 5th business day following submission if not specified

## Impact Assessment

This is a product enhancement specific to NJ Mutual Fund investors using the BSE StAR MF Platform. The impact is limited to:

- **Investor Benefit**: Provides more flexibility for rupee-cost averaging strategies with daily transfer frequency
- **Market Impact**: Minimal - affects only NJ Mutual Fund unitholders who opt for this facility
- **Operational Impact**: Internal process enhancement for NJ Asset Management Private Limited
- **No broader market implications** for listed companies or trading activities

The facility is optional and available to investors seeking more frequent automated transfers between schemes within the NJ Mutual Fund family.
