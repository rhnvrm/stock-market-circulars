## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced in this circular. This is a routine listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must take note of the new securities being listed
- Trading systems should be updated to reflect the increased share capital for each company
- No special compliance actions required beyond standard listing acknowledgment

- **Effective Trading Date:** January 27, 2026 (Tuesday)
- **Lock-in Period:** None (NA for all securities)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine corporate action that typically has limited impact on stock prices or trading volumes. The increase in share capital is relatively small for most companies, particularly the larger banks.

**Liquidity Impact:** Marginal increase in floating stock for each company. Urban Company sees the largest absolute increase in shares, though as a percentage of total outstanding shares, the impact varies by company.

**Dilution Impact:** Existing shareholders will experience minor dilution. For HDFC Bank and Axis Bank, given their large market capitalizations, the dilution effect is negligible. Urban Company's issuance is more significant in absolute numbers but context of total outstanding shares would determine actual dilution percentage.

**Investor Consideration:** ESOP conversions generally indicate employee confidence and retention but have minimal immediate trading implications since there are no lock-in restrictions preventing immediate sale.
