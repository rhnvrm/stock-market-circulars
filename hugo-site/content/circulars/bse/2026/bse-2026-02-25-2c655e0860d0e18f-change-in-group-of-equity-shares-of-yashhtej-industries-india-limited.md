  to M Group

## Summary

BSE has announced that the equity shares of YASHHTEJ INDUSTRIES (INDIA) LIMITED (SME IPO, Scrip Code: 544708) will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to the Rolling segment (M Group) effective Thursday, March 12, 2026. This follows the Exchange's earlier Notice No. 20260224-17 dated February 24, 2026.

## Key Points

- Equity shares of YASHHTEJ INDUSTRIES (INDIA) LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544708) will move from MT Group (Trade for Trade) to M Group (Rolling segment).
- The change is effective from Thursday, March 12, 2026.
- This is a continuation of the Exchange's prior Notice No. 20260224-17 dated February 24, 2026.

## Compliance Requirements

- **February 25, 2026**: Confirmation notice issued (No. 20260225-2).

## Impact Assessment

This transition from Trade for Trade (MT Group) to Rolling settlement (M Group) is a positive development for market participants trading YASHHTEJ INDUSTRIES shares. Under Trade for Trade, each transaction must result in compulsory delivery, limiting intraday trading. Moving to the Rolling segment allows for netting of positions and greater trading flexibility. This is a standard lifecycle step for SME IPO stocks after their initial listing period, indicating the stock has met exchange criteria for migration to normal trading conditions.
