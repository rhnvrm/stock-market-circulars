## Impact Assessment

For traders and investors, the circular clarifies the tradeable float of Clean Max Enviro Energy Solutions Limited from its listing date. IPO public and ESOP shares are immediately tradeable, while anchor, AIF, and promoter shares will be progressively released over a 3-year window. The staggered lock-in structure reduces near-term selling pressure from large institutional and promoter holders. Investors should monitor the March 27 and May 26, 2026 anchor lock-in expiry dates as potential liquidity events that could influence share price. The 3-year promoter lock-in on the largest tranches provides long-term holding signal from insiders.
