## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in the Non-Convertible Debentures of PRACHAY CAPITAL LIMITED (Code: PCL-14%-14-8-29-UL-PVT, ISIN: INE0IID07710, Scrip Code: 976847) effective January 30, 2026. The suspension is due to the company setting a record date for redemption on exercise of put option and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the effective date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension in PRACHAY CAPITAL LIMITED debentures effective from January 30, 2026
- Debenture ISIN: INE0IID07710 (Scrip Code: 976847)
- Debenture series: PCL-14%-14-8-29-UL-PVT (14% interest rate)
- Purpose: Redemption on exercise of put option and payment of interest
- Record date: January 30, 2026
- Circular number: DR-809/2025-2026
- All trading members instructed not to deal in these securities

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action-driven trading suspension in accordance with standard debt market procedures for record date compliance.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from January 30, 2026
- Trading members should inform their clients holding or interested in trading these debentures about the suspension
- Debenture holders must be on record as of January 30, 2026 to be eligible for redemption proceeds and interest payment
- Compliance with the no-dealing instruction is mandatory for all exchange members

## Important Dates

- **January 21, 2026**: Circular issued by BSE
- **January 30, 2026**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **January 30, 2026**: Trading suspension effective date (no dealings from this date)

## Impact Assessment

The trading suspension has high impact on existing debenture holders who must ensure their holdings are properly recorded by the record date. Investors holding these debentures will be unable to exit their positions from January 30, 2026 onwards. The put option exercise provides debenture holders with early redemption opportunity at their discretion. Since this is a private placement (indicated by 'PVT' suffix), the broader market impact is limited. The suspension ensures proper settlement and prevents trading during the corporate action period, protecting investor interests and maintaining market integrity. Trading members must adjust their systems and client communications accordingly.
