## Summary

BSE has issued a notice (No. 20260226-4) informing trading members of the new ISIN number assigned to AQYLON NEXUS LIMITED (Scrip Code: 530943) following the sub-division of its equity shares from Rs.10/- per share to Re.1/- per share. This notice is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20260219-10 dated February 19, 2026.

## Key Points

- **Company:** AQYLON NEXUS LIMITED (Scrip Code: 530943)
- **New ISIN:** INE416A01051
- **Corporate Action:** Sub-division of equity shares from face value Rs.10/- to Re.1/- per share
- **Ex-Date:** March 5, 2026 (DR-833/2025-2026)
- **Reference Notice:** Exchange Notice No. 20260219-10 dated February 19, 2026
- The new ISIN is effective for all trades conducted on and from the ex-date

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This notice operationalises a previously announced corporate action (share sub-division) by assigning the new ISIN under the existing securities identification framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number INE416A01051 for AQYLON NEXUS LIMITED prior to the ex-date of March 5, 2026.
- All trades in the sub-divided equity shares of Re.1/- each must reference the new ISIN from the ex-date onwards.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Ex-Date (effective date for new ISIN):** March 5, 2026
- **Reference Notice Date:** February 19, 2026 (Notice No. 20260219-10)

## Impact Assessment

This is a standard operational update for trading members. The share sub-division increases the number of shares in circulation while reducing the face value proportionally (10:1 ratio), which typically improves liquidity and affordability of the stock. Trading members and depository participants must ensure systems reflect the new ISIN INE416A01051 before March 5, 2026 to avoid settlement failures or trade discrepancies.
