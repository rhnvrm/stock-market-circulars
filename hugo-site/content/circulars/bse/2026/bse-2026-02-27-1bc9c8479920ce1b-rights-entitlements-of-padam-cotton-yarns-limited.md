## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Circular Date | February 27, 2026 |
| Commencement of RE Trading (Renunciation) | March 02, 2026 |
| Last Day of RE Trading (Renunciation) | March 04, 2026 |
| Rights Issue Open Date | March 02, 2026 |
| Rights Issue Close Date | March 09, 2026 |
| Lapse of unsubscribed/unrenounced REs | After March 09, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a moderate and company-specific impact. Existing shareholders of Padam Cotton Yarns Limited who received Rights Entitlements have a short three-day window (March 02–04, 2026) to renounce their REs on the exchange. Trading members need to ensure client communications and contract note disclaimers are in place before March 02. REs that are neither exercised nor renounced will lapse after the Rights Issue closing date (March 09, 2026), resulting in loss of value for holders. The trade-for-trade settlement mechanism limits speculative activity in these instruments.
