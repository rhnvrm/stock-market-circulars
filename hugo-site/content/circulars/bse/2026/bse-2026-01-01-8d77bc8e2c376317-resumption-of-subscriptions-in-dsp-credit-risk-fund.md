---

## Summary

DSP Mutual Fund has announced the reopening of subscriptions for DSP Credit Risk Fund effective January 01, 2026, after a temporary suspension that began on December 16, 2021. The scheme will accept fresh purchases, additional purchases, and systematic transactions subject to a maximum investment limit of INR 10 crore per PAN and a revised exit load structure with significantly higher penalties for early redemptions.

## Key Points

- Subscriptions were temporarily suspended since December 16, 2021
- Scheme reopens for all types of subscriptions from January 01, 2026
- Total investment value per PAN capped at INR 10 crore (including existing investments and fresh inflows)
- Exit load increased from 1% to 3% for redemptions within 12 months
- Previous 10% free exit allowance removed
- No exit load for redemptions after 12 months from allotment date
- Exit load changes apply to all prospective investments and systematic transactions registered on or after the effective date
- Designated employees' mandatory investments under SEBI alignment requirements are exempt from these restrictions

## Regulatory Changes

**Exit Load Structure Changes:**

Previous Structure:
- Nil exit load for redemptions up to 10% of units within 12 months
- 1% exit load for redemptions exceeding 10% within 12 months
- Nil exit load after 12 months

Revised Structure (Effective January 01, 2026):
- 3% exit load for all redemptions within 12 months from allotment date
- Nil exit load for redemptions on or after 12 months from allotment date
- No exit load for switches between Direct Plan and Regular Plan
- For systematic transactions (SIP, STP), exit load prevailing on registration/enrolment date applies

## Compliance Requirements

**For Investors:**
- Maximum investment limit of INR 10 crore per PAN across all transactions (fresh purchases, additional purchases, Switch-in, SIP, STP-in)
- Must update PAN, KYC, email address, mobile number, and nominee details with AMC
- Should link PAN with Aadhaar Number
- Review Investor Charter available on Fund website

- Apply new exit load structure to all prospective investments from effective date

## Important Dates

- **December 15, 2021**: Notice issued for temporary suspension of subscriptions
- **December 16, 2021**: Subscriptions temporarily suspended
- **December 26, 2025**: Announcement date for reopening
- **January 01, 2026**: Effective date for reopening of subscriptions with new conditions

## Impact Assessment

**For Existing Investors:**
- Subject to INR 10 crore per PAN cap for any additional investments
- Previous investments not affected by exit load changes unless new subscriptions made
- Higher exit load (3%) discourages short-term redemptions

**For New Investors:**
- Access to credit risk fund strategy now available after 4+ year suspension
- Investment limit may restrict large institutional or HNI allocations
- Significantly higher exit load (3% vs previous 1%) for 12-month lock-in period encourages longer holding periods
- No partial free exit option (previous 10% allowance removed)

**Market Impact:**
- Limited direct market impact as this affects single mutual fund scheme
- May influence investor behavior towards longer-term holdings in the credit risk category
- Signals fund manager's confidence in portfolio quality and liquidity management
