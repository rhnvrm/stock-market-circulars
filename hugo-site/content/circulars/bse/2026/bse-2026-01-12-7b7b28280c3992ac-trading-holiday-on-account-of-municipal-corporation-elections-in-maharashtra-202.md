- This is a modification to the previously published 2026 holiday calendar
- No trading will occur in Mutual Fund Segment on this day
- Other segments may operate normally (not specified in this notice)

## Regulatory Changes

Partial modification to BSE notice number 20251216-22 dated December 16, 2025, which originally declared Trading Holidays for the Year 2026 in the Mutual Fund Segment. An additional holiday has been added to the calendar.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must note the trading closure for January 15, 2026

**Operational Impact**: Members and participants need to adjust their operational schedules, inform clients, and ensure no mutual fund transactions are scheduled for January 15, 2026. Settlement cycles for trades executed before this date should be planned accordingly.

**Scope**: This holiday applies only to the Mutual Fund Segment of BSE and does not affect equity, derivatives, or other trading segments unless separately notified.
