## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine listing of new equity shares from warrant conversion. The number of shares (12.3 lakh) represents a relatively small addition to the company's equity base.

**Lock-in Consideration**: All newly issued shares are subject to lock-in until July 23, 2026, meaning they cannot be traded until that date, limiting immediate market supply impact.

**Dilution**: The preferential allotment to non-promoters will result in minor dilution for existing shareholders, with the exact percentage depending on the company's total outstanding shares.
