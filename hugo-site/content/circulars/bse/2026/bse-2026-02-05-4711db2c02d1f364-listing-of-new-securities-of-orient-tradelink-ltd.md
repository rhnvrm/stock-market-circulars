## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with limited market impact. The listing increases Orient Tradelink Ltd.'s equity base by 53.64 lakh shares, which will be tradable from February 6, 2026. However, all shares are locked-in until August 31, 2026, preventing immediate liquidity impact. The preferential allotment to non-promoters at Rs. 16/- per share suggests capital raising activity. Trading members and investors should note the lock-in restrictions when considering transactions in this scrip.
