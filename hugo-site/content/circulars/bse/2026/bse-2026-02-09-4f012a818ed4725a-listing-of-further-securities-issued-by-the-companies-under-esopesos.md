- **Lock-in Period**: Not Applicable (NA) for all securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The additional shares represent routine ESOP/ESOS allotments to employees and constitute a small percentage of total outstanding shares for each company. The absence of lock-in periods indicates these shares can be traded immediately, but the volumes are relatively small and unlikely to cause significant price movements.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in tradable float for the 15 listed companies. The largest addition is Ather Energy with 494,266 shares.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may experience minor dilution, though the impact is negligible given the small proportion of new shares relative to existing share bases (ranging from 0.0003% to 0.03% based on typical outstanding share counts for these companies).
