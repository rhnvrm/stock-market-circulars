## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** February 23, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This circular affects traders and investors holding or trading in the 33 specified scrips. Stocks assigned a 2% band (8 scrips) face the tightest restrictions, likely reflecting heightened surveillance concern. Stocks revised to 20% bands (5 scrips: Asarfi Hospital, Oricon Enterprises, Shri Keshav Cements, Travels & Rentals, U.Y. Fincorp) are being given wider trading room, potentially reflecting a relaxation from prior tighter bands. Overall market impact is limited as these are primarily small/mid-cap scrips, but individual stock liquidity and intraday trading strategies will be directly affected.
