---

## Summary

BSE received clarification letters from three listed companies — Associated Coaters Limited (Scrip Code: 544183), Tanvi Foods (India) Limited, and Vesuvius India Limited — in response to exchange queries regarding significant price or volume movements in their respective securities. All three companies affirm that they have complied with SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, and that the observed movements are purely market-driven with no undisclosed material or price-sensitive information.

## Key Points

- **Associated Coaters Limited** (BSE: ASSOCIATED, Scrip Code: 544183) responded on February 20, 2026, to a BSE email dated February 19, 2026, stating that all price-sensitive events have been disclosed as required under Regulation 30 of SEBI LODR, and that share price movement is purely market-driven.
- **Tanvi Foods (India) Limited** responded on February 21, 2026, to a BSE clarification request dated February 20, 2026, stating all material information has been disclosed and management has no connection to the share price movement.
- **Vesuvius India Limited** responded on February 23, 2026, to a BSE email dated February 23, 2026 (Reference: L/SURV/ONL/PV/SG/2025-2026/927), regarding significant increase in trading volume; confirmed all material information bearing on operations/performance has been disclosed.
- All three companies reiterate ongoing commitment to compliance under SEBI LODR Regulation 30 and applicable laws.

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. These are reactive compliance communications in response to BSE surveillance queries under existing SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies are required to respond to BSE surveillance queries regarding unusual price or volume movements under Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015.
- Listed entities must confirm whether any undisclosed material information exists that could account for the observed market activity.
- All three companies have fulfilled this obligation by submitting written clarifications to BSE's Corporate Relations Department.

## Important Dates

- **February 19, 2026**: BSE query sent to Associated Coaters Ltd regarding price movement.
- **February 20, 2026**: Associated Coaters Ltd response submitted; BSE query sent to Tanvi Foods (India) Ltd.
- **February 21, 2026**: Tanvi Foods (India) Ltd response submitted.
- **February 23, 2026**: BSE query sent to and response received from Vesuvius India Ltd regarding volume movement.

## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal direct market or operational impact. The clarification letters are a standard regulatory procedure under BSE's surveillance mechanism. All three companies deny knowledge of any undisclosed material event driving the price or volume movement, which provides no new investment signal. Investors and market participants should note that these responses do not confirm or deny the underlying cause of price/volume changes — they only confirm regulatory compliance status. Vesuvius India Ltd's response regarding volume movement (as opposed to price) may warrant additional monitoring.
