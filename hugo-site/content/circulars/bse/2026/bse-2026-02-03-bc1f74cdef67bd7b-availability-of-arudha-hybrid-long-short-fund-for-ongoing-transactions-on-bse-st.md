## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it is purely informational. It provides investors access to a new hybrid long-short fund product on the BSE StAR MF platform. The fund offers comprehensive plan options catering to different investor preferences for income distribution and investment approaches (Regular vs Direct plans). The availability expands the mutual fund product offerings on BSE's platform but does not affect existing market operations or require any action from market participants unless they wish to invest in these schemes.
