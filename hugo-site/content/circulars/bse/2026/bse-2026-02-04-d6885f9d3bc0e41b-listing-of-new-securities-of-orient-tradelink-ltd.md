## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing of preferential allotment shares from warrant conversion for a single company. The shares represent capital raised from non-promoters and will increase the free float marginally.

**Liquidity Impact**: Limited impact expected. All shares are under lock-in until August 31, 2026, preventing immediate trading by allottees.

**Dilution**: The 24.48 lakh new shares will dilute existing shareholders' holdings proportionately, though the extent depends on the existing share capital structure of Orient Tradelink Ltd.
