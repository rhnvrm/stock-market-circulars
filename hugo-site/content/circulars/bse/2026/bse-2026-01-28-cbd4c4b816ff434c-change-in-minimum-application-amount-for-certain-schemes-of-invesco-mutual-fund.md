## Important Dates

Effective Date: The circular is dated January 28, 2026. No specific implementation date mentioned; changes are expected to be effective immediately or as per standard amendment timelines.

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact on Accessibility**: The reduction in minimum application amounts from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100 significantly lowers the entry barrier for retail investors, potentially expanding the investor base for these schemes.

**Enhanced Investment Flexibility**: Introduction of daily (Rs. 20 minimum) and weekly (Rs. 100 minimum) SIP frequencies provides greater flexibility for investors with smaller savings capacity or those preferring more frequent investment schedules.

**Operational Impact**: Investors can now access six Invesco equity and hybrid schemes with 90% lower minimum investment amounts, making systematic investing more accessible across income segments.

**Market Reach**: The changes align with industry trends toward democratizing mutual fund investments and may increase Assets Under Management (AUM) through broader retail participation.

**IDCW Option Enhancement**: Extension of daily/weekly SIP to IDCW (Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal) options provides income-focused investors with enhanced systematic investment capabilities.
