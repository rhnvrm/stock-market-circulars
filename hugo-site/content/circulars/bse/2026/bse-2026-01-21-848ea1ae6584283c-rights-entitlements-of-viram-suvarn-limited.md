## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform all clients about commencement of RE trading
- Must clearly mention ISIN of the RE (INE607V20010) to avoid confusion with ordinary shares
- Must include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases informing clients that:
  - Purchase of REs only gives right to participate in ongoing Rights Issue by making application with requisite money OR renounce the REs before issue closes
  - REs which are neither subscribed nor renounced on or before Issue Closing Date shall lapse and be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market-wide impact as it pertains specifically to VIRAM SUVARN LIMITED shareholders and traders. Existing shareholders receive rights to subscribe to additional shares or renounce their entitlements for trading. The trade-for-trade and demat-only requirements ensure transparent settlement. REs provide temporary trading opportunity for 8 days (January 23-30) while the broader Rights Issue remains open for 15 days (January 23 to February 06). Non-action by the Issue Closing Date results in lapse of entitlements.
