title: Revision of Price Bands - Circuit Filter Changes to 2%
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the circuit filter percentage to 2% for 68 securities listed on the exchange. This revision implements tighter price band restrictions, limiting the maximum price movement allowed during a trading session. The circular lists all affected securities with their scrip codes, ISIN numbers, and company names.

## Key Points

- Circuit filter revised to 2% for 68 securities
- Tighter price movement restrictions implemented
- Affects securities across various sectors including pharma, infrastructure, textiles, and finance
- Complete list provided with scrip codes and ISIN numbers for reference
- Likely indicates enhanced surveillance measures for these securities

## Regulatory Changes

The exchange has modified the circuit filter mechanism for the listed securities from their previous levels to a uniform 2% band. This change represents a more restrictive trading environment for these specific securities, typically implemented as a surveillance measure to control excessive volatility or unusual price movements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure their systems recognize the new 2% circuit filter for all affected securities
- Price orders beyond the 2% band (both upper and lower limits) will be rejected
- Members should update risk management systems and client communication regarding the revised price bands
- Market participants must adjust trading strategies to account for the tighter circuit limits

## Important Dates

Effective Date: The circular is dated February 04, 2026. The revised circuit filters are applicable from the date specified in the circular (typically effective immediately or from the next trading session).

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** The 2% circuit filter significantly restricts intraday price volatility for all 68 affected securities. This will limit potential gains/losses within a single trading session and may impact liquidity.

**Market Participant Impact:** Day traders and short-term traders will face reduced opportunity for intraday profits. Institutional investors and long-term holders are less affected.

**Surveillance Context:** The application of a 2% circuit filter typically indicates that these securities are under enhanced surveillance due to concerns about price manipulation, unusual volatility, or other regulatory factors.

**Liquidity Concerns:** Tighter circuit filters may reduce trading volumes as price discovery is constrained, potentially widening bid-ask spreads.

## Affected Securities Summary

The circular covers 68 companies across diverse sectors including:
- Industrial and manufacturing companies
- Pharmaceutical and healthcare firms
- Real estate and infrastructure developers
- Financial services and investment companies
- Textile and chemical manufacturers
- Technology and entertainment sectors

Note: The content appears truncated at "Samtel India L" - the full company name for scrip code 500371 (INE538C01017) is likely "Samtel India Limited."
