## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification with limited market impact. The preferential allotment to Non-Promoters through warrant conversion represents approximately 5.86 lakh shares with a total value of approximately Rs. 26.67 crores at the issue price of Rs. 455 per share. The lock-in period until July 11, 2026, ensures these shares cannot be immediately traded by the allottees, minimizing short-term supply pressure. The pari-passu ranking ensures equitable treatment with existing shareholders.
