## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: The extension provides existing eligible shareholders with an additional week to evaluate and participate in the Rights Issue, potentially increasing subscription rates. Shareholders who may have missed the original deadline now have more time to exercise their rights or renounce them on-market.

**Market Impact**: Limited broader market impact as this affects only Galaxy Agrico Exports Limited shareholders. The extension indicates the company's intention to maximize shareholder participation in the Rights Issue.

**Operational Impact**: Post-issue activities timeline will be revised accordingly. The company, registrar (Purva Sharegistry), and BSE will need to update all communication materials and systems to reflect the new deadlines.
