## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will impact trading flexibility for these securities. IIFL Finance Ltd, being a significant financial services entity, receives a relatively wider 20% band, allowing greater price discovery. Seven securities have 10% bands, indicating moderate surveillance concerns. The 5% bands for Luxury Time Ltd and MPDL Ltd, and particularly the 2% band for Thrive Future Habitats Ltd, suggest heightened surveillance measures and will significantly restrict intraday price movements for these stocks.
