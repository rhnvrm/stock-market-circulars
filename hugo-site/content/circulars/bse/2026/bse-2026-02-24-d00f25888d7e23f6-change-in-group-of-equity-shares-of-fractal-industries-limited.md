## Regulatory Changes

The equity shares of Fractal Industries Limited will move from the Trade for Trade (MT Group) settlement mechanism to the standard Rolling settlement (M Group). In Trade for Trade, each transaction must be settled individually with mandatory delivery; Rolling settlement allows netting of trades and standard T+1 settlement.

- **February 24, 2026**: Current continuation notice issued
- **March 11, 2026**: Effective date of transfer from MT Group to M Group (Rolling segment)

## Impact Assessment

This migration from Trade for Trade (MT Group) to Rolling segment (M Group) is operationally significant for traders and investors in Fractal Industries Limited. Post-migration, the stock will be eligible for normal Rolling settlement, potentially improving liquidity and easing trading restrictions that are typically imposed under the Trade for Trade mechanism. Traders holding positions should be aware of the change in settlement obligations from March 11, 2026 onwards.
