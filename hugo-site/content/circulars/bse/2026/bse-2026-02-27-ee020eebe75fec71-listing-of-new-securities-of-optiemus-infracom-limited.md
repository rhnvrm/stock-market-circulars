## Summary

BSE Notice No. 20260227-36 informs trading members that 7,866 new equity shares of Optiemus Infracom Limited (Scrip Code: 530135) have been listed and are permitted to trade on BSE with effect from Monday, March 2, 2026. The shares were issued to non-promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to conversion of warrants.

## Key Points

- 7,866 equity shares of Rs. 10/- face value each are listed on BSE effective March 2, 2026
- Shares issued at a premium of Rs. 662.25, making the total issue price Rs. 672.25 per share
- Issued to non-promoters on a preferential basis via conversion of warrants
- New shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares of the company
- ISIN: INE350C01017
- Distribution numbers: 88376627 to 88384492
- Date of allotment: January 2, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced. This is a standard listing notification pursuant to an earlier preferential allotment and warrant conversion approved under applicable SEBI regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to update their records to reflect the new securities available for trading from March 2, 2026
- The 7,866 shares are subject to a lock-in period and cannot be traded by the allottees until the lock-in expires

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** January 2, 2026
- **Trading Commencement Date:** March 2, 2026 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Expiry Date:** September 10, 2026 (for all 7,866 shares, Dist. Nos. 88376627 to 88384492)

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this listing on the market is minimal. Only 7,866 shares are being added to the tradeable pool, which is a very small incremental addition to the total equity of Optiemus Infracom Limited. Additionally, all newly listed shares are under lock-in until September 10, 2026, meaning they will not be available for secondary market trading by the allottees during this period. Existing shareholders are unaffected in terms of rights or ranking, as the new shares are pari-passu with existing equity.
