## Summary

Trading in equity shares of Caspian Corporate Services Ltd (Scrip Code 534732) will resume on January 13, 2026 following consolidation of equity shares from Re. 1/- to Rs. 10/- face value. A new ISIN number INE176N01039 has been assigned for the consolidated shares with a market lot of 1 share.

## Key Points

- Trading resumption date: January 13, 2026
- Share consolidation: Re. 1/- fully paid up to Rs. 10/- fully paid up (10:1 consolidation)
- New ISIN: INE176N01039 (replaces old ISIN)
- Market lot: 1 share
- Scrip Code: 534732 (unchanged)
- DR reference: DR-797/2025-2026
- Trading members advised to exercise caution when entering prices due to face value change

## Regulatory Changes

This circular continues from Exchange Notice No. 20251223-37 dated December 23, 2025. The consolidation changes the share structure from Re. 1/- face value to Rs. 10/- face value, a 10-fold increase in face value per share.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN INE176N01039 for all transactions from January 13, 2026 onwards
- Trading members must exercise abundant precautions when quoting prices for the consolidated equity shares
- All market participants must recognize the new face value of Rs. 10/- per share when trading commences

## Important Dates

- **January 7, 2026**: Notice date
- **January 13, 2026**: Trading resumption date; new ISIN becomes valid for transactions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Trading resumption affects existing shareholders and potential investors in Caspian Corporate Services Ltd. The 10:1 consolidation means share prices will need to be adjusted proportionally.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN and ensure correct price entry accounting for the 10x face value increase. Risk of pricing errors if members do not adjust for the consolidation ratio, hence the exchange's caution advisory.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will hold 1/10th the number of shares but at 10x the face value, maintaining the same investment value. Market lot remains at 1 share, improving accessibility for small investors.
