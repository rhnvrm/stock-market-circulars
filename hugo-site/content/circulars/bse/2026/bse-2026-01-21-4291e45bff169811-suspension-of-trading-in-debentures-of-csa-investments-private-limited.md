## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of CSA Investments Private Limited debentures. This is a routine suspension for a private placement debt security undergoing redemption. The suspension prevents trading activity during the corporate action period to ensure proper settlement of redemption proceeds and interest payments to eligible debenture holders as per the record date. Market-wide impact is minimal as this affects a single private company's debt instrument.
