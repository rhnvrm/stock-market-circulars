title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective January 12, 2026. The circular identifies 4 new securities entering LT-ASM, 7 securities moving to lower ASM stages while remaining in LT-ASM, and 22 securities moving out of the LT-ASM framework entirely. No securities are being moved to higher ASM stages or directly placed in Stage IV.

## Key Points

- 4 securities newly shortlisted in LT-ASM Framework: Bedmutha Industries, Novateor Research Laboratories, Shah Metacorp, and Taylormade Renewables
- 7 securities continue in LT-ASM but move to lower stages (3 to Stage I, 2 to Stage II, 2 to Stage III)
- 22 securities moving out of LT-ASM Framework completely
- No securities moving to higher ASM stages or direct Stage IV placement
- All changes effective from January 12, 2026

## Securities Affected

**Part A - New LT-ASM Additions:**
1. Bedmutha Industries Ltd (533270, INE844K01012)
2. Novateor Research Laboratories Ltd (542771, INE08JY01013)
3. Shah Metacorp Ltd (533275, INE482J01021)
4. Taylormade Renewables Ltd (541228, INE459Z01017)

**Part C - Moving to Lower ASM Stages:**

- Stage II: CIAN Agro Industries & Infrastructure, Indo Thai Securities
- Stage III: Axiscades Technologies, BGR Energy Systems

**Annexure II - Exiting LT-ASM:**
22 securities including Apollo Micro Systems, Bacil Pharma, Bharat Seats, KIOCL, MPIL Corporation, Skyline Ventures India, and others

## Regulatory Changes

Securities in LT-ASM Framework are subject to enhanced surveillance measures including higher margin requirements, restricted trading mechanisms, and additional disclosure requirements. The framework uses a staged approach (Stage I through IV) with progressively stricter measures based on surveillance parameters.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable ASM stage requirements for affected securities
- Enhanced margin and trading restrictions apply to securities entering or remaining in LT-ASM
- Investors should note special trading conditions for securities under surveillance measures
- Risk management systems must be updated to reflect new ASM classifications

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** January 12, 2026 - All changes to LT-ASM classifications become effective

## Impact Assessment

The LT-ASM framework changes will significantly impact trading in the affected securities. The 4 new additions will face stricter surveillance including potential price bands, additional margin requirements, and enhanced disclosure obligations. The 7 securities moving to lower stages will experience some relaxation in surveillance measures, improving liquidity. The 22 securities exiting LT-ASM will return to normal trading conditions, likely improving market participation and reducing trading costs. Market participants should adjust risk management and trading strategies accordingly for all affected securities.
