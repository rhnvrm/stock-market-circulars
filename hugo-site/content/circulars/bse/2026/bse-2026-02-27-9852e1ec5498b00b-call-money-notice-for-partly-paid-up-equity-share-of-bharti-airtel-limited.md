## Impact Assessment

This is a high-impact event affecting holders of Bharti Airtel's partly paid-up equity shares (symbol: AIRTELPPCM). With approximately 39.23 crore shares subject to a call of Rs. 401.25 each, the aggregate call money is approximately Rs. 15,744 crore, making this one of the larger call money exercises in recent market history. Shareholders who do not pay the call money risk forfeiture of their partly paid shares. Trading members and SCSBs must ensure their IBBS access is active and operational before March 2, 2026. The 15-day window (March 2–16, 2026) provides reasonable time for compliance, but early submission is advisable to avoid last-minute system congestion.
