title: BOLT PRO TWS System Configuration Update
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updated system configuration requirements for the BOLT PRO TWS Application. All trading members using this platform must review and update their systems to meet the new recommended specifications to ensure optimal performance and stability. The application must be used strictly on Windows 11 OS, as other Windows versions may cause runtime errors.

## Key Points

- Minimum processor requirement: Intel I5 or equivalent
- RAM requirement: 8 GB minimum, 16 GB recommended
- Network requirement: 1 Ethernet port
- Storage requirement: 100 GB free disk space
- Operating system: Windows 11 (mandatory)
- Using BOLT PRO TWS on non-recommended Windows OS versions may lead to runtime errors
- Configuration update aims to ensure optimal performance, stability and enhanced user experience

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a technical infrastructure update.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must review their current system configurations
- Systems must be updated to meet or exceed the recommended specifications
- BOLT PRO TWS must be operated exclusively on Windows 11 operating system
- Members experiencing issues or requiring clarification should contact BSE Helpdesk at 022-45720400/600, 022-69158500 or bsehelp@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- Notice Date: January 23, 2026
- No specific implementation deadline mentioned, but immediate compliance is implied

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading members using BOLT PRO TWS will need to audit their existing infrastructure and potentially upgrade hardware (RAM, storage) and operating systems (to Windows 11). This may require capital expenditure and system downtime for upgrades.

**Market Impact:** Low - No direct market impact, but inadequate system performance could affect trading efficiency for individual members if configurations are not updated.

**Technical Impact:** High for non-compliant systems - Members running on older Windows versions face risk of runtime errors and operational disruptions if they do not upgrade to Windows 11.
