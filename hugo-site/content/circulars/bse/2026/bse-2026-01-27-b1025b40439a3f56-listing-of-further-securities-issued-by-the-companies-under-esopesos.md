## Key Points

- Total of 658,010 equity shares listed across 4 tranches
- Tranche 1: 188,400 shares (Serial No. 12528959772-12529148171) - No lock-in

- Tranche 4: 269,610 shares (Serial No. 12529143372-12529229381) - Lock-in applied
- Lock-in period for applicable tranches: January 15, 2026 to February 14, 2026 (30 days)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must adhere to lock-in restrictions for tranches 2 and 4
- Locked-in shares cannot be traded during the specified lock-in period
- Trading participants should note serial number ranges for verification

## Important Dates

- Listing Date: January 27, 2026
- Lock-in Period Start: January 15, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. This is a routine administrative listing of employee stock options with relatively small share volumes. The lock-in provisions on approximately 54% of the shares (355,610 shares) will prevent immediate trading. These listings represent standard employee compensation mechanisms and do not indicate material corporate actions or changes in market structure.
