## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of preferential allotment shares representing warrant conversions. The shares increase the equity base of Orient Tradelink Ltd. by 24,48,000 shares, but the lock-in period until August 31, 2026 means these shares will not be available for trading by current holders, limiting immediate supply impact.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and new distinctive number ranges. The pari-passu status means no special treatment required for corporate actions.

**Dilution**: The new shares will dilute existing shareholders, though the exact percentage depends on the pre-issue capital base (not mentioned in the circular).
