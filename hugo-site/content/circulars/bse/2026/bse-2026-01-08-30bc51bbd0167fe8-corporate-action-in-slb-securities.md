## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium. Affects participants in the SLB segment who have borrowed or lent these securities. The bonus issue for Authum Investment requires mandatory position closure, which could lead to temporary volatility.

**Operational Impact:** SLB participants must monitor and manage their positions in these three securities, ensuring compliance with foreclosure requirements and shut period restrictions. The bonus issue creates additional operational requirements compared to standard dividend actions.

**Liquidity Impact:** The shut periods will temporarily reduce liquidity in the SLB segment for these securities, potentially affecting hedging and arbitrage strategies that rely on securities lending.
