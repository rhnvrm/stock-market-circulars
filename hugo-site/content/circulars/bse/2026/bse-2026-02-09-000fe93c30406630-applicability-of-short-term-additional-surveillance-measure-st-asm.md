Ten securities are newly shortlisted under ST-ASM Stage I, one security (Vivimed Labs Ltd) continues in the framework but moves to a lower stage, and seven securities are moving out of the ST-ASM framework. The changes include both mainboard and SME scrips.

## Key Points

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects 18 securities with changes in trading conditions. New additions face enhanced surveillance which may reduce speculative activity and liquidity.

**Operational Impact**: Two securities transitioning to other frameworks (LT-ASM and ESM) indicate persistent concerns requiring more stringent measures. Five securities exiting indicates improvement in trading patterns.
