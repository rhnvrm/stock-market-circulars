## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard operational notice for a scheduled demat auction under existing BSE auction settlement procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Member brokers whose clients have delivery shortfalls in Settlement No. 828 must participate in the auction process
- Buyers of auctioned securities will receive shares at auction-determined prices
- Sellers who failed to deliver will be debited at auction price plus applicable penalties
- Members must ensure timely settlement of auction obligations as per BSE guidelines

## Important Dates

- **Auction Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Settlement Reference:** Settlement No. 828

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine demat auction notice with moderate market impact confined to the 93 listed securities. Notable large-quantity auctions in Viram Suvarna (37,000 shares), SBL Infratech (28,800 shares), and Empower India (14,136 shares) may see localized price pressure. Blue-chip inclusions such as Reliance Industries, ITC, Tata Motors, HUL, and Tata Steel involve small quantities and are unlikely to cause significant price movement. Holders and traders of these specific scrips should be aware of potential auction-related volatility on the settlement date.
