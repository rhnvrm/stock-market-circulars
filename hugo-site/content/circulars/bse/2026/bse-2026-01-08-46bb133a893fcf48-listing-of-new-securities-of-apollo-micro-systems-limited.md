## Lock-in Details

| Number of Shares | Distribution Numbers | Lock-in Period Until |

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of 12.1 million shares represents a significant increase in share capital. The two-tier lock-in structure (majority locked until July 2027) will limit immediate supply pressure on the stock.

**Liquidity Impact**: Medium-term liquidity impact as only 14.6 lakh shares become tradeable in July 2026, while the bulk (1.07 crore shares) remains locked until July 2027.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution in equity. The preferential allotment to promoters and non-promoters at Rs. 114 per share will impact ownership percentages and earnings per share calculations.
