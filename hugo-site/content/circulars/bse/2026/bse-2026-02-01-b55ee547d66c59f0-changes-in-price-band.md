Tighter bands (2%, 5%) indicate higher surveillance concerns, while wider bands (10%, 20%) allow greater price movement flexibility.

- Systems should be updated to reflect new price band percentages before market opening on February 2, 2026
- Clarifications can be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Violations of price band limits will be subject to standard exchange surveillance actions

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 1, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 2, 2026
- **Implementation:** From market opening on February 2, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Traders and investors in these 9 securities will face restricted price movement ranges, potentially limiting intraday volatility and speculative trading. Securities with 2% bands (Shantai Industries, Simandhar Impex) will have the most constrained trading ranges.

**Market Operations:** Trading systems and risk management frameworks must be updated to accommodate the revised bands. The changes signal heightened surveillance on these securities, which may affect investor sentiment and liquidity.

**Investor Consideration:** Price bands are typically applied due to concerns about volatility, unusual price movements, or other surveillance triggers. Investors should exercise caution and review the underlying reasons for surveillance measures before trading in these scrips.
