## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to HILTON METAL FORGING LIMITED shareholders and participants in the rights issue. The 3-day renunciation window provides limited trading opportunity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure proper client communication, contract note disclaimers, and understanding of T+1 settlement mechanics for trade-for-trade basis. Clients need awareness that unexercised REs will lapse after the issue closing date.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders receive rights entitlements that can be traded during the 3-day window, exercised during the 8-day rights issue period, or allowed to lapse. Time-sensitive decision required.
