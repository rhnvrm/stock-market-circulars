## Summary

BSE has announced that the equity shares of INDO SMC LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544681), an SME IPO company, will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to the Rolling segment (M Group) effective February 04, 2026. This change follows the previous notice dated January 20, 2026, and represents a shift to more flexible trading arrangements for the company's shares.

## Key Points

- Scrip Code: 544681
- Current segment: Trade for Trade segment (MT Group)
- New segment: Rolling segment (M Group)
- Effective date: Wednesday, February 04, 2026
- Notice number: 20260121-3

## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for INDO SMC LIMITED shares will transition from a restricted Trade for Trade (T2T) segment to the standard Rolling settlement segment. The T2T segment requires compulsory delivery of shares and is typically used for securities with high price volatility or surveillance concerns. The shift to Rolling segment (M Group) indicates normalized trading conditions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must note the segment change in their systems
- All dealings in the equity shares must be processed under M Group from February 04, 2026
- Trading Members requiring clarification should contact Mr. Nitinkumar Pujari (Tel: 022-2272 8398)

## Important Dates

- **January 20, 2026**: Prior notice issued (Notice No. 20260120-49)
- **January 21, 2026**: Current notice published
- **February 04, 2026**: Effective date for segment transfer

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium positive impact for INDO SMC LIMITED shareholders. The move from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment increases liquidity and trading flexibility, as T2T segments restrict intraday trading and require full delivery. This typically signals improved market confidence in the stock.

**Trading Impact**: Enhanced trading flexibility with ability for intraday positions, margin trading, and normal settlement cycles instead of compulsory delivery. This should improve liquidity and potentially reduce impact costs for traders.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the group change from MT to M Group by the effective date.
