## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This represents a substantial increase in Biocon's equity base through the issuance of over 171 million new shares. The share swap arrangement suggests a strategic corporate action, potentially an acquisition or merger transaction. The preferential allotment to non-promoters indicates external stakeholder participation.

**Dilution Impact**: Existing shareholders will experience dilution depending on the pre-issue share capital. The significant number of shares suggests a major capital event.

**Liquidity Impact**: Post lock-in expiry on July 13, 2026, the free float will increase substantially, potentially improving liquidity. However, the immediate impact is neutral as shares remain locked for 6 months.

**Price Impact**: The issue price of Rs. 405.78 provides a reference point for valuation. Market participants should monitor trading patterns when these shares become tradable on January 12, 2026, though actual free-float impact will occur only after lock-in expiry.
