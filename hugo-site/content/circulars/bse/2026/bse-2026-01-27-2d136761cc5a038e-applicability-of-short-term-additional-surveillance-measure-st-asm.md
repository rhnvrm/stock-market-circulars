title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update on the applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective January 28, 2026. The circular identifies securities being newly shortlisted into the ST-ASM framework, securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages, and securities exiting the framework. The ST-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance on securities showing unusual price movements or volatility over 5/15/30 day periods.

## Key Points

- 4 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework (Bharat Rasayan Ltd, Dhampur Bio Organics Ltd, Oasis Securities Ltd, Spinaroo Commercial Ltd)
- 1 security (Amit Securities Ltd) moving to higher Stage II ASM
- 6 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework (Astron Multigrain Ltd, Dolphin Offshore Enterprises, Neopolitan Pizza And Foods Ltd, Shree Rama Multi-Tech Ltd, Spright Agro Ltd, Wardwizard Innovations & Mobility Ltd)
- Consolidated list includes 16+ securities currently under various ST-ASM stages
- Framework includes special markings for SME scrips (@) and T+0 scrips (~)
- Securities may exit ST-ASM due to inclusion in other frameworks (LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge, ESM)

## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term ASM framework continues BSE's surveillance mechanism to identify and monitor securities with abnormal price movements. Securities under ST-ASM face enhanced surveillance with potential restrictions on trading to protect investor interests. The framework operates in stages (Stage I, Stage II, etc.) with progressively stricter measures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised ST-ASM list effective January 28, 2026
- Trading members should inform clients about securities under ST-ASM framework
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in ST-ASM securities
- Investors should be aware of additional surveillance and potential trading restrictions on listed securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 28, 2026 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities newly added to ST-ASM may experience reduced liquidity and increased volatility due to enhanced surveillance measures. Stage upgrades indicate continued concerns about price movements.

**Market Participants**: Brokers and investors holding or trading these securities must adjust strategies considering additional monitoring and potential restrictions.

**Investor Protection**: The framework aims to protect retail investors from excessive speculation and manipulation in volatile securities. Securities exiting the framework indicate improved stability or migration to other surveillance mechanisms.

**SME Segment**: Multiple SME scrips included, reflecting BSE's heightened focus on surveillance in the SME segment where retail participation is significant.
