## Impact Assessment

The suspension affects debt market participants holding or trading commercial papers of these 15 issuers. Impact is limited to specific instruments approaching maturity. The simultaneous redemption of 13 commercial papers on February 12 indicates coordinated issuance cycles among financial services companies. Market liquidity in these specific instruments will cease from suspension dates through redemption completion. No broader market implications expected as this is routine redemption process.
