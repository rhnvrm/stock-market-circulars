## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine NFO launch that expands the product offerings on BSE StAR MF Platform. The introduction of a Specialized Investment Fund with equity long-short strategy provides investors with an additional investment vehicle but does not affect broader market operations.

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium for mutual fund distributors and members of BSE StAR MF Platform who need to:
- Configure systems to handle the new scheme codes and ISINs
- Manage payment collection and settlement timelines
- Monitor transaction status and cancellation processes
- Ensure compliance with fund transfer deadlines

**Investor Impact**: Provides access to a specialized equity long-short strategy through 360 ONE MUTUAL FUND, offering flexibility through multiple plan options and SIP facility. The extended trading hours on the last day provide additional convenience for lumpsum investments.
