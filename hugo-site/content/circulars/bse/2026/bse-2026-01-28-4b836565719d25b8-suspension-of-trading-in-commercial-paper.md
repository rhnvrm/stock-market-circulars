Investors holding these securities will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms of issuance. No trading disruption expected as these are scheduled redemptions. The diversity of issuers (financial services, industrial, infrastructure, real estate trusts) indicates normal market activity across sectors. Trading members must update their systems to prevent inadvertent trades during the suspension period.
