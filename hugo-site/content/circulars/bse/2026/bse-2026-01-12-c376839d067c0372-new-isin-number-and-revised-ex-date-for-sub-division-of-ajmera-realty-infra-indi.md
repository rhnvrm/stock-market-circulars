  India Ltd
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a revised notice regarding the stock sub-division of Ajmera Realty & Infra India Ltd (Scrip Code: 513349). Due to a trading holiday on January 15, 2026, the ex-date for the sub-division has been revised to January 14, 2026. The company will split each existing equity share of Rs.10 face value into five equity shares of Rs.2 face value each. A new ISIN number INE298G01035 has been assigned for the sub-divided shares, effective from the ex-date.

## Key Points

- Stock sub-division ratio: 1 equity share of Rs.10 split into 5 equity shares of Rs.2 each
- Revised ex-date: January 14, 2026 (changed from January 15, 2026)
- Record date: January 15, 2026
- Old ISIN INE298G01027 (Rs.10 face value) will become invalid for transactions from January 14, 2026 onwards
- New ISIN INE298G01035 (Rs.2 face value) effective from January 14, 2026
- Change necessitated by settlement/trading holiday on January 15, 2026
- DR reference: DR-798/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action implementation with revised timeline due to trading holiday.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN number INE298G01035 for all trades from January 14, 2026 onwards
- The old ISIN number INE298G01027 must not be used for transactions on or after January 14, 2026
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the revised ex-date and new ISIN
- All transactions in the sub-divided shares (Rs.2 face value) must be conducted through the new ISIN

## Important Dates

- **January 12, 2026**: Notice date for revised ex-date and new ISIN
- **January 14, 2026**: Revised ex-date for sub-division (trades from this date onwards will be in sub-divided shares)
- **January 15, 2026**: Record date and trading holiday
- **January 14, 2026**: Old ISIN INE298G01027 becomes invalid; new ISIN INE298G01035 becomes effective

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The stock sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the face value and market price proportionally. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors. The revised ex-date due to the trading holiday ensures proper settlement cycles are maintained.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants must update their systems to accommodate the new ISIN number and ensure smooth transition from the old to new securities. Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares of Rs.2 face value for every 1 share of Rs.10 face value held as of the record date. The ISIN change requires updates to trading, clearing, and settlement systems to prevent disruptions.
