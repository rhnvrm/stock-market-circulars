title: Suspension of Trading in Debentures of Mahindra Rural Housing Finance Limited
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in specific Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of Mahindra Rural Housing Finance Limited (MRHFL) effective January 15, 2026. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for interest payment and redemption of the debentures with ISIN INE950O07420 (Code: 974569). Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Company: Mahindra Rural Housing Finance Limited (MRHFL)
- Debenture ISIN: INE950O07420
- BSE Code: 974569
- Debenture Series: MRHFL-8.20%-30-1-26-PVT
- Record Date: January 15, 2026
- No Dealings From: January 15, 2026
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Notice Number: DR-799/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a routine trading suspension notification in accordance with standard procedures for debt securities reaching their redemption date.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified MRHFL debentures from January 15, 2026
- Trading members must ensure their systems and operations reflect the trading suspension
- Debenture holders as of the record date (January 15, 2026) will be eligible for interest payment and redemption proceeds

## Important Dates

- **January 9, 2026**: Circular issued
- **January 15, 2026**: Record date for interest payment and redemption
- **January 15, 2026**: Trading suspension becomes effective (no dealings allowed)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. The trading suspension is limited to a single debt security series and is a routine corporate action for maturing debentures. This is a standard procedure and does not indicate any credit issues or operational concerns.

**Investor Impact**: Medium for affected debenture holders. Investors holding these specific NCDs cannot trade them from January 15, 2026. However, this is expected as the debentures are reaching maturity (January 30, 2026 based on the series name) and holders will receive their redemption proceeds and final interest payment.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Trading members need to ensure compliance with the suspension directive, but this is a routine operational requirement for debt market participants.
