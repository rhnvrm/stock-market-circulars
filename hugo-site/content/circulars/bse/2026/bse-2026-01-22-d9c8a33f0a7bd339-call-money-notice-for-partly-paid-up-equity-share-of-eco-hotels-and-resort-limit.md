**Operational Impact**: Medium for affected stakeholders - Trading Members, SCSBs, and intermediaries need to facilitate the call money collection process through the IBBS platform. Shareholders must arrange funds to meet the call obligation of Rs. 3.80 per share.

**Financial Impact**: Company will receive Rs. 48.93 crore (1,28,76,808 shares × Rs. 3.80) if all shareholders meet the call obligation. Non-payment by shareholders may lead to forfeiture of shares as per company's articles of association.
