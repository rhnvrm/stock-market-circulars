## Impact Assessment

This preferential issue to the promoter represents a significant capital raise for Adani Ports. The lock-in period of approximately 18 months demonstrates long-term commitment from the promoter. The shares being pari-passu with existing shares means they carry equal voting and dividend rights. The substantial number of shares (approximately 14.38 crore) may impact the company's share capital structure and dilution metrics, though the promoter allotment typically strengthens promoter holding. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the expanded share capital.
