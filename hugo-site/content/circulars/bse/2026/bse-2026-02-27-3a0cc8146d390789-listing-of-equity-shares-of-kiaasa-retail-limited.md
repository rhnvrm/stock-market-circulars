## Compliance Requirements

- Listed entity has submitted the mandatory declaration table under Regulation 31
- Where 'No' is declared for any item, the corresponding values are treated as zero by default on the stock exchange dissemination platform
- Columns for partly paid-up shares, outstanding convertible securities/warrants, depository receipts, and pledged shares are suppressed from public display as all relevant declarations are 'No'

## Important Dates

- **Record Date for Shareholding Pattern**: February 26, 2026 (Post-IPO)
- **Circular Date**: February 27, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This filing has minimal market impact as it is a routine regulatory disclosure. The confirmation that no promoter shares are pledged or encumbered is a positive signal for investor confidence. The presence of lock-in shares for both promoter and public categories is standard for post-IPO scenarios and limits near-term selling pressure from locked shareholders. No actionable changes for market participants are required beyond noting the updated shareholding structure.
