title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities List Updates Effective February
  01, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updated lists for the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework effective February 01, 2026. The changes include:
- 1 security newly shortlisted in ESM (Colinz Laboratories Ltd)
- 2 securities moving to higher ESM stages (Gujarat Inject Kerala Ltd, Sarup Industries Ltd)
- 14 securities moving to lower ESM stages
- 23 securities exiting the ESM framework entirely

ESM is a risk management framework that places additional trading restrictions on securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or other risk indicators.

## Key Points

- **New ESM Entry**: Colinz Laboratories Ltd (531210, INE923C01011) enters ESM framework
- **Higher Stage Movements**: 2 securities upgraded to stricter surveillance stages due to continued risk concerns
- **Lower Stage Movements**: 14 securities downgraded to less restrictive ESM stages showing improvement
- **ESM Exits**: 23 securities removed from ESM framework, returning to normal trading conditions
- **Effective Date**: All changes take effect from February 01, 2026
- **SME Scrips**: Several SME-listed securities included in these changes (marked with #)

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework applies progressive surveillance stages with increasing restrictions:
- Securities in higher ESM stages face stricter trading conditions (lower price bands, trade-to-trade settlement, additional margins)
- Movement between stages based on continued risk assessment
- Exit from ESM indicates normalization of trading behavior and risk profile

## Compliance Requirements

- **Investors and Traders**: Be aware of ESM status before trading; ESM securities have restricted trading conditions
- **Broker-Dealers**: Ensure proper risk disclosures to clients trading ESM securities
- **Listed Companies**: Monitor ESM status and address underlying concerns to facilitate exit from framework
- **Market Participants**: Review positions in affected securities before February 01, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 01, 2026 - All ESM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Securities Entering/Moving Higher**: Increased trading restrictions may reduce liquidity and require additional margins. Colinz Laboratories and 2 other securities face stricter surveillance.

**Securities Moving Lower**: 14 securities benefit from relaxed restrictions, potentially improving liquidity and trading activity.

**Securities Exiting ESM**: 23 securities return to normal trading framework, removing restrictions and improving market access. Notable exits include Essar Shipping, Systematix Securities, and several SME scrips.

**Overall Market Impact**: Medium - affects specific securities rather than broad market. Investors holding these stocks should review positions and adjust strategies based on new surveillance status.
