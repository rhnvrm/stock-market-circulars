## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The addition of 2.30 crore shares represents significant equity dilution for Ugro Capital Limited. The preferential allotment to non-promoters at Rs. 185 per share will increase the company's equity base and total outstanding shares.

**Liquidity Impact:** Lock-in until June 30, 2026 means these shares will not be available for trading in the secondary market for approximately 5.5 months from listing date, limiting immediate supply impact.

**Shareholding Impact:** The conversion of CCDs to equity shares will alter the shareholding pattern, increasing non-promoter holdings. Investors should review updated shareholding disclosures.

**Capital Structure:** The conversion adds to paid-up equity capital while reducing debt component (CCDs), improving the debt-equity ratio and capital structure of Ugro Capital Limited.
