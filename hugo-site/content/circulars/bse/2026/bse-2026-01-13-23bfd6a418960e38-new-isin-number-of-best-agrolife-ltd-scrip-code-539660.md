The new ISIN will be effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of January 16, 2026. This notice is in continuation to Exchange Notice No. 20260106-25 dated January 06, 2026.

## Key Points

- Company: BEST AGROLIFE LTD (Scrip Code: 539660)
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Re.1/- (1:10 ratio)
- New Face Value: Re.1/- per equity share
- Ex-Date: January 16, 2026
- Reference: DR-800/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action where the company has sub-divided its equity shares, requiring issuance of a new ISIN for the shares with revised face value.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must use the new ISIN INE052T01021 for all trades in BEST AGROLIFE LTD equity shares executed on or after January 16, 2026
- All market participants should update their systems and records with the new ISIN

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 13, 2026
- **Ex-Date**: January 16, 2026 (new ISIN becomes effective)
- **Previous Notice Reference**: January 06, 2026 (Notice No. 20260106-25)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The sub-division increases the number of shares outstanding by 10 times while reducing the price per share proportionately, making the stock more accessible to retail investors. The liquidity profile may improve due to lower per-share price.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market infrastructure providers must ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN before the ex-date to avoid trade settlement issues. Shareholders will see their shareholding quantity multiplied by 10 with proportionate reduction in per-share value, with no change to total investment value.
