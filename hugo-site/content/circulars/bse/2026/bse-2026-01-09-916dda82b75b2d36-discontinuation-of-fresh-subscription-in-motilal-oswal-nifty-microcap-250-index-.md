title: Discontinuation of Fresh Subscription in Motilal Oswal Nifty Microcap 250 Index
  Fund
---

## Summary

Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company Limited has discontinued subscription in units of Motilal Oswal Nifty Microcap 250 Index Fund with immediate effect from the cut-off time of January 8, 2026. This decision was made in consultation with SEBI as microcap is not defined as a category based on market capitalization. The discontinuation affects fresh purchases, additional purchases, switch-ins, and all new and existing SIP/STP registrations.

## Key Points

- Fresh and additional purchases through lump sum mode discontinued immediately
- Switch-in transactions from other Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund schemes stopped
- Fresh registrations under SIP and STP discontinued
- Existing SIPs/STPs paused effective from January 8, 2026
- Switch-in transactions received until cut-off time on January 8, 2026 will be processed
- Any subscription amount received after cut-off time will be refunded without interest
- Decision made in consultation with SEBI
- Reason: Microcap is not defined as a category based on market capitalization

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI consultation led to the discontinuation as microcap does not qualify as a defined category based on market capitalization. This represents a regulatory clarification on fund categorization that necessitates closure of fresh subscriptions for this specific fund.

## Compliance Requirements

- AMC must refund any subscription amounts received after January 8, 2026 cut-off time without interest
- All pending switch-in transactions received until cut-off time on January 8, 2026 must be processed
- Existing SIP/STP arrangements must be paused
- This addendum forms an integral part of the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)
- All other terms and conditions of SID and KIM remain unchanged

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 8, 2026 (cut-off time)
- **Circular Date**: January 8, 2026
- **Last Date for Switch-in Processing**: January 8, 2026 (up to cut-off time)
- **SIP/STP Pause Date**: January 8, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: High - Existing investors cannot make additional investments through any mode (lump sum, SIP, STP, or switch-in). Existing SIP/STP arrangements are paused, requiring investors to redirect their systematic investment plans to other schemes.

**Market Impact**: Medium - While this affects only one specific fund, it sets a precedent for regulatory treatment of microcap categorization in mutual funds. Investors seeking microcap exposure will need to find alternative investment vehicles.

**Operational Impact**: High - The AMC must immediately halt all subscription processing, pause all existing systematic plans, process refunds for post-cut-off subscriptions, and communicate changes to all distributors and investors.
