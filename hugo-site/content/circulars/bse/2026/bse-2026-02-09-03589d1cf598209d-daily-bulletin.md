## Impact Assessment

This bulletin has medium impact for specific shareholders and debenture holders of the listed companies. The dividend announcements affect shareholder returns, while NCD redemptions and commercial paper maturities impact debt investors' cash flows. The cancellation of Aurionpro Solutions' dividend is notable. Overall market impact is limited as these are routine corporate actions affecting individual securities rather than market-wide changes.
