## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. ESOP share listings are routine corporate actions representing a small percentage increase in outstanding shares. The dilution impact ranges from negligible to minor across the 10 companies.

**Trading Impact:** Low liquidity impact expected as these shares become tradable without restrictions. ICICI Bank and IDFC First Bank have the largest absolute numbers but represent minimal dilution given their large existing share base.

**Corporate Impact:** Positive for employee compensation and retention. Companies fulfilling commitments under employee incentive schemes. No impact on operations or fundamentals.

**Investor Impact:** Marginal dilution for existing shareholders. Share price impact typically neutral to slightly negative but immaterial given the small quantities relative to total market capitalization.
