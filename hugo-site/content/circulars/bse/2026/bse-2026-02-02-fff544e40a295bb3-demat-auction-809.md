## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects liquidity and settlement for specific securities. While routine, demat auctions can lead to price volatility in affected scrips during auction execution.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers with delivery failures face:
- Potential mark-to-market losses if auction prices differ from trade prices
- Penalties and charges as per BSE rules
- Impact on risk management and client relations

**Investor Impact:** Clients of buying brokers may experience delayed delivery if securities are sourced through auction rather than normal settlement. The wide range of securities (from blue-chips to small-caps) indicates settlement issues across market segments.
