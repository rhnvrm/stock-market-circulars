## Summary

BSE has issued a notice (No. 20260224-49) directing trading members not to deal in the Non-Convertible Debentures of INDIGRID INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST with effect from February 27, 2026. The suspension is necessitated by the company fixing a Record Date for Early Redemption of the debentures and Payment of interest.

## Key Points

- Trading members are advised not to deal in INDIGRID INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST debentures from **February 27, 2026**.

- The circular reference number is **DR-830/2025-2026**.

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must **not execute any trades** in the debenture series IGT-8.9922%-14-2-29-PVT-InvIT (INE219X07025 / Code 958599) from February 27, 2026 onwards.

## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Circular Date | February 24, 2026 |
| Record Date | February 27, 2026 |
| No Dealings From | February 27, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

The suspension affects trading in one specific debenture series of INDIGRID INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST, an Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT). Investors and traders holding or intending to trade in ISIN INE219X07025 on or after February 27, 2026 will be unable to do so on the BSE debt segment. The early redemption implies debenture holders will receive their principal back along with accrued interest, concluding this instrument's lifecycle on the exchange.
