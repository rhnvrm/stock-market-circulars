- Security charge and personal guarantee terms remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

2. Personal guarantee remains unchanged

3. Corporate Guarantee: Reduced from 100% of the debt to 20% of the debt

## Impact Assessment

The reduction in corporate guarantee coverage from 100% to 20% of the debt represents a material weakening of security for debenture holders.

This modification may impact the risk profile and valuation of these debt securities in the secondary market.
