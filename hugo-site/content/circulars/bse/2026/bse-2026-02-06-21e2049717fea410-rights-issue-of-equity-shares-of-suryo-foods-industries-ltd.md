## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will face potential dilution if they do not participate in the rights issue. The 3:4 ratio represents a 75% rights entitlement, which is relatively favorable. At Rs. 20 per share (including premium), shareholders need to evaluate the offer price against current market price.

**Market Impact**: The stock will trade ex-rights from February 11, 2026, which typically results in a price adjustment to reflect the dilution effect. Trading members and investors should account for this adjustment in their trading strategies.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems are configured to handle ex-rights trading from the specified date. Proper settlement procedures under DR-818/2025-2026 must be followed.
