## Impact Assessment

The revision of price bands is a surveillance measure to control volatility in these securities. Tighter bands (2%, 5%) suggest heightened regulatory scrutiny and aim to prevent excessive price fluctuations. Securities with 2% bands (Aptus Pharma, Rotographics) face the most restrictive trading environment, while Yajur Fibres with 20% band has relatively more flexibility. These measures may impact liquidity and trading strategies for affected stocks.
