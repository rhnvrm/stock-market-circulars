Effective January 7, 2026 (Settlement No. DR-793/2025-2026), the scrip will be moved from P group to XT group, traded in Trade to Trade (T2T) segment with compulsory demat settlement, and the market lot will be reduced from 100 shares to 1 share.

## Key Points

- Group change: P group to XT group
- Market lot revised from 100 shares to 1 share
- Trade to Trade (T2T) segment for reasons other than non-signing of depository agreements
- Compulsory demat settlement required
- Netting not allowed in the scrip
- Shortages will be directly closed-out
- ISIN: INE0OUS01011 (existing, unchanged)

The scrip will be moved to the XT group and traded in the Trade to Trade segment. All trades must be settled in compulsory dematerialized form following the company's signing of agreements with both depositories. The market lot has been standardized to 1 equity share from the previous lot size of 100 shares.

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members dealing with Shentracon Chemicals will need to adjust their trading and settlement processes for this scrip. The reduction in market lot from 100 to 1 share provides greater flexibility for smaller transactions.

**Market Impact**: Medium - The move to XT group and T2T segment indicates regulatory oversight for reasons other than depository agreement non-compliance. This may affect liquidity as netting is not allowed and all positions must be delivered. The compulsory demat requirement ensures investor protection and settlement efficiency.

**Investor Impact**: The smaller market lot of 1 share makes the scrip more accessible to retail investors, while T2T segment requirements ensure delivery-based trading only.
