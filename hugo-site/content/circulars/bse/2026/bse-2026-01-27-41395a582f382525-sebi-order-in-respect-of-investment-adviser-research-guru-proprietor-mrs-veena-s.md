## Impact Assessment

This enforcement action highlights SEBI's strict monitoring of registered investment advisers and zero-tolerance approach toward fraudulent operations. The case demonstrates serious concerns about front-running registrations where actual operations are conducted by unauthorized persons. The alleged franchising model poses systemic risks by allowing unregistered entities to provide investment advisory services under cover of legitimate registration. This action serves as a warning to all registered intermediaries to ensure compliance with operational requirements and prevent misuse of registration credentials. Investors should verify that investment advisers are operating in accordance with their registration and that authorized persons are actually managing the advisory services.
