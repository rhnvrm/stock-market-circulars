## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 116 scrips with varying liquidity levels. While most quantities are small, some scrips like WELCURE DRUG, EVEXIA LIFEC, Lasa Superge, and Rajnish Well have significant auction quantities that could impact price discovery.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers with delivery shortfalls must arrange funds to purchase securities through auction at potentially unfavorable prices. Clients with short positions may face higher costs due to auction premiums.

**Liquidity Impact:** Large auction quantities in small-cap/illiquid stocks (WELCURE DRUG - 613,972 shares, Rajnish Well - 5,000 shares, Lasa Superge - 5,000 shares) may experience significant price volatility during auction execution.
