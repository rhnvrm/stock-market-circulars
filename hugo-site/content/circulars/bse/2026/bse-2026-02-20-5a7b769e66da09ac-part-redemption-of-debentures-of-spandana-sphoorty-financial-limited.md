## Impact Assessment

This part redemption reduces the face value of each debenture from its current level to Rs. 87,500, indicating a partial principal repayment to debenture holders. The impact is contained to holders of this specific NCD series and traders in the BSE debt segment. The 11.25% coupon and December 2027 maturity remain unchanged. Existing holders will receive a partial principal payout along with accrued interest on the record date. Post-redemption, the outstanding principal per debenture decreases, which will be reflected in the trading price.
