## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) is a surveillance framework applied to securities showing abnormal price movements or other concerns. Securities under ESM face additional trading restrictions and monitoring. The framework operates in multiple stages with progressively stringent measures as securities move to higher stages.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors and traders must be aware of ESM status before trading affected securities
- Securities in ESM may have additional margin requirements and trading restrictions
- Market participants should review the consolidated list to understand current ESM classifications
- Brokers must inform clients about ESM status of securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 6, 2026 - All ESM changes become effective from market opening

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - ESM classification typically results in reduced liquidity, higher transaction costs, and increased margin requirements for affected securities.

**Trading Impact**: Securities newly added to ESM or moving to higher stages will face stricter surveillance and may experience reduced trading activity. Stage migration indicates continued concerns about price movements or market behavior.

**Investor Impact**: Existing investors in affected securities should monitor positions closely. New investors should understand ESM implications including potential difficulty in exiting positions and higher costs.

**Affected Securities Summary**:
- **New to ESM**: Bodhtree Consulting Ltd, Vision Cinemas Ltd
- **Moving to Higher Stages**: CDG Petchem Ltd, Mahamaya Steel Industries Ltd, Mega Nirman and Industries Ltd, Regal Entertainment & Consultants Ltd, SC Agrotech Ltd
- **Total Securities in ESM**: 26+ securities across Stage I and Stage II classifications
