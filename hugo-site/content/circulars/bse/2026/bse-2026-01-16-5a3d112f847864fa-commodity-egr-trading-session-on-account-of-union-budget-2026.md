## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The special session allows market participants to react to Union Budget announcements in real-time for commodity and gold markets. This is particularly significant as budget announcements often impact commodity prices, import duties, and gold-related policies.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members need to ensure staffing and system availability on a Sunday. The compressed session (only morning session) may lead to higher trading volumes and volatility during the active hours.

**Segment Specific**: Affects only Commodity Derivatives and Electronic Gold Receipt segments. Equity and other segments have separate circulars for their trading arrangements.
