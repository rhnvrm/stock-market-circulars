## Important Dates

- **Lock-in Start Date (Most Tranches)**: January 19, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The listing adds Shayona Engineering Limited to BSE's equity segment, but immediate trading liquidity will be limited due to extensive lock-in periods covering 38,91,150 shares (99.97% of total). Only 1,118 shares are immediately available for trading.

**Investor Impact**: Promoters and early investors holding locked-in shares cannot exit their positions until respective lock-in periods expire. The staggered lock-in structure (2027, 2028, 2029) will gradually release shares into the market over three years.

**Trading Impact**: Limited float in the initial period may result in higher volatility and price discovery challenges. Trading activity will increase progressively as lock-in periods expire.
