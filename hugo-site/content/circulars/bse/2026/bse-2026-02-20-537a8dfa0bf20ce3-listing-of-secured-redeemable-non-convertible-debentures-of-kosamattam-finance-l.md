## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt listing with no broad market impact. The listing enables secondary market trading of these NCDs on BSE's debt segment for existing allottees. The credit rating of IND A/Stable indicates investment-grade quality. Investors in fixed-income instruments may find the higher-yield series (Options VI–VIII offering 10.22%–10.47% effective yield) of interest, though liquidity in the secondary market for retail NCDs is typically limited. The issuance is by Kosamattam Finance Limited, an NBFC primarily engaged in gold loan financing.
