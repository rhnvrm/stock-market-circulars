## Impact Assessment

The listing introduces approximately 5.95 crore new units into the market, representing potential dilution for existing unit holders of Anzen India Energy Yield Plus Trust. However, the one-year lock-in on all newly allotted units (until March 03, 2027) limits immediate selling pressure and protects near-term price stability. Market participants should factor the eventual unlocking into their medium-term outlook on the trust's unit price. The preferential allotment to non-sponsors at Rs. 117/- also establishes a reference price point for the trust's valuation.
