|---|---|
| Circular Date | 24 February 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

The trading restriction is limited to the partly paid equity shares of a single company (ANNVRRIDHHI VENTURES LTD, Scrip Code 890229) and is effective from the record date. The impact is narrow, affecting only holders of and traders in these specific partly paid shares. Shareholders of partly paid shares will receive call notices for the First Call of Rs. 2.50 per share, which may result in further capital outflow for existing partly paid shareholders who choose to pay the call money.
