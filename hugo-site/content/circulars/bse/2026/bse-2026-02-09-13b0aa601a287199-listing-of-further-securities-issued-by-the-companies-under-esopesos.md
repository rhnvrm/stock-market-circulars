## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing of ESOP shares is a routine corporate action that typically has negligible impact on stock prices. The quantities being listed represent a small fraction of the total outstanding shares for these companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in tradable float for each company. The additional shares may provide slight improvement in liquidity but are unlikely to materially affect trading dynamics.

**Dilution Impact**: Minor dilution to existing shareholders, as these shares were already accounted for in the companies' authorized ESOP pools. The dilution effect was anticipated when the ESOP schemes were originally approved.

**Investor Consideration**: These listings indicate that employees are exercising their stock options, which can be viewed as a positive sign of employee confidence in the company's prospects. The absence of lock-in periods means these shares can be immediately traded in the market.
