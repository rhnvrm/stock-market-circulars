title: Adjustment of Futures and Options Contract of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd on account
  of Stock Split
---

## Summary

BSE has announced mandatory adjustments to all Futures and Options contracts of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd (Scrip Code: 500247, Derivatives Asset Code: KOTB) following the company's 1:5 stock split. The adjustments will be implemented at end of day on January 13, 2026, with the ex-date being January 14, 2026. Each equity share of Rs. 5 will be subdivided into five equity shares of Rs. 1 each.

## Key Points

- Adjustment factor: 5 (based on 5:1 stock split ratio)
- Strike prices will be divided by 5 (e.g., 2100 becomes 420)
- Market lot will be multiplied by 5 (existing 400 becomes 2000)
- Futures prices will be divided by 5 and rounded to nearest tick size
- All positions will be multiplied by 5
- Adjustments comply with SEBI guidelines for corporate actions

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. The circular implements existing SEBI guidelines for adjustment of Futures & Options contracts on announcement of corporate actions, specifically stock splits.

## Compliance Requirements

- Equity Derivatives Segment members must note the automatic adjustments
- Trading members should contact designated Relationship Managers for clarifications
- All existing F&O contracts will be automatically adjusted by the exchange
- Traders must account for revised strike prices, market lots, and positions in their trading strategies

## Important Dates

- **January 2, 2026**: Notice date
- **January 13, 2026**: Adjustment implementation date (end of day)
- **January 14, 2026**: Record date and ex-date for stock split

## Impact Assessment

High impact on derivatives market participants holding KOTB contracts. All active futures and options positions will undergo systematic adjustments including:

- Strike price reduction by factor of 5 increases granularity of available strikes
- Market lot increase from 400 to 2000 shares maintains contract value but changes position sizing
- Existing positions multiply by 5, maintaining economic exposure but changing contract count
- Traders must recalibrate margin requirements and risk management parameters
- Potential for temporary volatility during adjustment period
- Enhanced liquidity expected post-split with lower strike price intervals
