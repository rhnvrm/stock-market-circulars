title: Introduction of Daily SIP for WHITEOAK Mutual Fund on BSE StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

WhiteOak Capital Mutual Fund (WOCMF) has introduced a Daily frequency option under its Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) facility for all existing schemes, effective February 01, 2026. This new frequency allows investors to make daily SIP investments on all business days (Monday to Friday) through the BSE StAR MF Platform, complementing the existing SIP frequency options.

## Key Points

- Daily SIP frequency available across all existing WhiteOak Capital Mutual Fund schemes from February 01, 2026
- Minimum investment: Rs. 100 per installment (in multiples of Re. 1) for equity schemes
- Minimum investment: Rs. 500 per installment for debt schemes and WhiteOak Capital ELSS Tax Saver Fund
- Minimum 6 installments required
- Investments will occur on all business days Monday to Friday (installments skipped on non-business days)
- Investors must select "As & when presented" as payment frequency in SIP Mandate/OTM
- SIP registration discontinued if 3 consecutive installments are not honored
- Daily SIP not available for Daily IDCW Plans

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a product enhancement introducing an additional SIP frequency option for WhiteOak Capital Mutual Fund schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors enrolling for Daily SIP must select "As & when presented" as payment frequency in the SIP Mandate/OTM
- SIP Top-Up frequency limited to half-yearly/yearly basis (minimum Rs. 100 in multiples of Re. 1)
- SIP Pause and Modify facilities not available under Daily frequency
- All existing SIP terms and conditions apply to Daily SIP facility
- Standard mutual fund disclosure: "Mutual Fund Investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully"

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 01, 2026 - Daily SIP frequency becomes available
- **Notice Date**: January 22, 2026 - Date of circular issuance

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a product feature enhancement specific to WhiteOak Capital Mutual Fund schemes that provides investors with additional flexibility in SIP frequency selection.

**Operational Impact**: Limited to WhiteOak MF investors and BSE StAR MF Platform operations. The daily frequency option may increase transaction processing volume but is voluntary and affects only participating investors.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for investors seeking higher SIP frequency and rupee cost averaging benefits through daily investments. The feature accommodates investors with daily cash flows but comes with restrictions (no pause/modify facility, limited top-up frequency).

**Platform Impact**: Enhances BSE StAR MF Platform's product offerings by enabling daily SIP functionality for WhiteOak schemes, potentially improving platform competitiveness.
