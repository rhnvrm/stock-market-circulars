**Market Impact:** Medium - affects liquidity in SLB segment for 19 securities during shut periods. Large-cap stocks like ITC, Nestle India, and CONCOR may see reduced lending availability.

**Trading Impact:** SLB participants cannot initiate new lending/borrowing transactions during shut periods. Existing positions may need early settlement to avoid forced closures.

**Investor Impact:** Dividend announcements are positive for shareholders. Go Fashion buyback may provide price support. SLB lenders should note that securities on loan may need to be recalled to qualify for dividend entitlements.

**Sectoral Distribution:** Diversified impact across sectors including FMCG (ITC, Nestle, Gillette), infrastructure (CONCOR, HUDCO), finance (REC, Manappuram), manufacturing (Carborundum, Coromandel), shipping (Great Eastern), technology (KPIT, Route Mobile), and commodities (MOIL).
