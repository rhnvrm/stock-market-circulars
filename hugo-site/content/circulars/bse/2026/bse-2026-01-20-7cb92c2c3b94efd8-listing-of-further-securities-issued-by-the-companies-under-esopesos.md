3. **Routine Nature**: ESOP/ESOS listings are regular corporate actions that typically have negligible price impact
4. **Diversified Impact**: The listing covers 8 different companies across multiple sectors, spreading any potential impact
5. **Established Companies**: All companies are well-established with significant market capitalization, further minimizing relative dilution impact
