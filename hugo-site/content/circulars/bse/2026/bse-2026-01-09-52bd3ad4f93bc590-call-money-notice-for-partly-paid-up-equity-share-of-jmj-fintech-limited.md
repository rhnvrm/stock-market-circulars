## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium for involved parties - Trading Members and SCSBs need to facilitate call money collection through IBBS platform

**Investor Impact:** High for affected shareholders - mandatory payment of Rs 7.35 per share required to convert partly paid-up shares to fully paid-up shares; failure to pay may result in forfeiture of shares and amounts already paid
