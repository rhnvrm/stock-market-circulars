## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this affects privately placed non-convertible debentures of a specific issuer. Debenture holders will receive partial redemption proceeds and interest payment. The reduced face value reflects the partial principal repayment, which is a standard corporate action for structured debt instruments. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face value from the effective date.
