title: Single Window Automatic and Generalised Access for Trusted Foreign Investors
  (SWAGAT-FI) framework for FPIs and FVCIs
---

## Summary

SEBI has introduced the Single Window Automatic and Generalised Access for Trusted Foreign Investors (SWAGAT-FI) framework through amendments to the FPI Regulations. This framework simplifies registration and compliance requirements for eligible foreign portfolio investors. The circular modifies the FPI Master Circular to accommodate SWAGAT-FI FPIs, allowing resident Indian contributions through LRS in global funds with less than 50% Indian exposure, and enables unified account management across FPI, FVCI, and other foreign investment categories.

## Key Points

- SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2025 notified on December 03, 2025
- Four categories eligible for SWAGAT-FI FPI registration: government/government-related investors, appropriately regulated mutual funds/unit trusts, insurance companies, and pension funds
- Mutual funds must operate as blind pools with diversified investors and independent investment managers
- Insurance companies must invest own funds without segregated portfolios
- Resident Indian contributions allowed through RBI's LRS in global funds with less than 50% Indian exposure
- SWAGAT-FI applicants must be from identified jurisdictions regulated by identified statutory authorities
- Existing FPIs meeting requirements can convert to SWAGAT-FI status by applying to their DDP
- Depositories must facilitate unified accounting for all securities across FPI, FVCI, and other foreign investment categories
- List of identified jurisdictions and regulatory bodies to be specified by CDSSF in consultation with SEBI
