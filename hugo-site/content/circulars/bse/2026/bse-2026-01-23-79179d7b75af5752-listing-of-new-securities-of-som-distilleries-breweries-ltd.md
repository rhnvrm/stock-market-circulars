## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. The shares are issued to promoters and are locked-in for approximately 1.5 years from the trading commencement date. This represents a capital infusion through warrant conversion and increases promoter stake. The preferential allotment at Rs. 110/- per share indicates promoter confidence. No immediate liquidity impact as shares cannot be sold until mid-2027.
