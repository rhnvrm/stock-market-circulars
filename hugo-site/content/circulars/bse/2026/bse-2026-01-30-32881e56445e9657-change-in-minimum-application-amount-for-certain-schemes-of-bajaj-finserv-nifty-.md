The changes increase the minimum investment threshold significantly, from Rs. 500 to Rs. 5,000 for fresh lumpsum purchases and from Rs. 100 to Rs. 1,000 for additional purchases on an ongoing basis.

## Key Points

- Fresh purchase (lumpsum) minimum amount increased from Rs. 500 to Rs. 5,000

- Switch-in minimum amount increased from Rs. 500 to Rs. 5,000
- Changes apply to both Bajaj Finserv Nifty 50 Index Fund and Bajaj Finserv Nifty Next 50 Index Fund
- All multiples remain at Re. 1 thereafter
- All other provisions of the SID and KIM remain unchanged
- Notice dated January 29, 2026 from Pune office

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

This change represents a 10x increase in minimum fresh purchase amounts and a 10x increase in additional purchase requirements. The revision may limit accessibility for smaller retail investors while potentially attracting more committed investors with higher investment capacity. The change is administrative in nature and does not affect the underlying investment strategy or portfolio composition of the funds. Market impact is minimal as this affects only two specific mutual fund schemes and does not influence trading operations or broader market participants.
