## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification following SEBI regulations for preferential allotment and warrant conversion.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the new securities are available for trading from February 4, 2026
- Lock-in restrictions apply to all 3,00,000 shares until August 31, 2026
- Shares issued in accordance with preferential allotment norms

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Dates**: August 12, 2025 (1,00,000 shares) and August 13, 2025 (2,00,000 shares)
- **Trading Commencement**: February 4, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry**: August 31, 2026
- **Circular Date**: February 3, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The allotment of 3 lakh shares represents a relatively small issuance that is unlikely to materially impact trading volumes or stock price. 

**Operational Impact**: Trading members can trade these securities from February 4, 2026, subject to lock-in restrictions. The shares are fungible with existing equity shares.

**Dilution**: The preferential allotment increases the equity base of Orient Tradelink Ltd., though the quantum suggests limited dilution to existing shareholders.

**Lock-in Period**: Complete lock-in until August 31, 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure from allottees.
