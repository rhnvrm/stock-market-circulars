## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The number of shares being listed represents a small fraction of the total outstanding equity for each company. The largest issuance is 587,818 shares by Lloyds Metals and Energy.

**Trading Impact**: Negligible impact on liquidity or trading volumes expected. ESOP/ESOS issuances are routine corporate actions that incrementally increase float.

**Investor Impact**: No direct impact on existing shareholders. These shares were allotted to employees as part of compensation and incentive structures. The absence of lock-in periods means shares are immediately tradable, though employee holders typically retain shares for longer periods.
