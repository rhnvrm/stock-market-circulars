## Important Dates

- **January 2, 2026**: Board approval and communication to BSE
- **January 16, 2026**: Record date for sub-division and bonus issue eligibility
- **January 16, 2026**: Effective date of sub-division
- **January 19, 2026**: Deemed date of allotment for bonus shares (T+1)

- **January 20, 2026**: Listing effective date and trading commencement (T+2)

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their holdings increase significantly - the 10:1 stock split followed by 1:2 bonus issue means shareholders will hold 15 shares for every 1 original share (10 from split + 5 from bonus). This increases liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors.

**Market Impact**: The stock split to Re.1/- face value will improve price accessibility and trading volumes. The bonus issue represents a capitalization of reserves and increases the company's equity base from approximately 2.36 crore shares to 35.47 crore shares post both actions.

**Warrant Holders**: Outstanding warrant holders will receive their proportionate bonus shares (1,17,18,750 reserved) only after full conversion by paying the balance 75% amount due.

**Trading Impact**: New ISIN assignment may require broker/demat account updates. Shareholders should expect automatic credit of new shares without any action required on their part.
