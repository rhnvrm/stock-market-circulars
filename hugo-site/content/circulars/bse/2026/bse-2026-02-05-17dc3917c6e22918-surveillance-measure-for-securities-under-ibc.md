## Summary

BSE has issued surveillance measures for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) framework. One security, Alka India Ltd (Scrip Code: 530889, ISIN: INE061B01038), has been shortlisted under Stage 1 of the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) for companies in Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP) effective February 06, 2026. No securities were added to or removed from Stage 0, and no securities moved between Stage 1 and Stage 2.

## Key Points

- Alka India Ltd added to IBC Stage 1 ASM effective February 06, 2026
- No securities added to Stage 0 (Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure)
- No securities moved from Stage 1 to Stage 2
- No securities moved from Stage 2 to Stage 1
- No securities excluded from ASM framework
- Consolidated list shows 14+ securities currently under IBC surveillance across various stages
- Securities marked with ^ are recommencement scrips
- Securities marked with ~ are T+0 scrips shortlisted via parent company

## Regulatory Changes

The IBC surveillance framework continues to operate with multiple stages:
- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company
- **Stage 1**: Additional Surveillance Measure for companies in Insolvency Resolution Process
- **Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance for continued IBC proceedings

Alka India Ltd has now entered Stage 1, subjecting it to additional surveillance measures and potential trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and investors should note the surveillance status of Alka India Ltd
- Enhanced due diligence required for trades in Stage 1 securities
- Market participants must comply with any additional margin or trading restrictions applicable to ASM securities
- Investors should monitor announcements regarding insolvency proceedings

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 06, 2026 - Alka India Ltd enters Stage 1 IBC ASM

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Alka India Ltd will face additional surveillance measures that may include higher margins, price bands, or trading restrictions. Liquidity may be impacted as investors become cautious about securities under insolvency proceedings.

**Investor Impact**: Existing and potential investors in Alka India Ltd should exercise heightened caution due to the company's entry into formal insolvency resolution process under IBC. Stage 1 classification indicates the company is undergoing Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP).

**Market Impact**: Limited broader market impact as only one security is affected in this update. However, the consolidated list shows multiple securities remain under IBC surveillance, indicating ongoing stress in certain segments.
