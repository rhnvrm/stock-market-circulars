## Summary

Government of Singapore (the Seller) has notified BSE and NSE of a proposed Offer for Sale (OFS) of IndiGrid Infrastructure Trust units through the stock exchange mechanism. The base offer comprises 4,36,31,371 units (4.58% of unit capital) with an oversubscription option of additional 2,64,59,185 units (2.78%), totaling up to 7,00,90,556 units (7.36% of unit capital). The OFS will be conducted in accordance with SEBI OFS Circular and Stock Exchange operational guidelines.

## Key Points

- **Oversubscription Option**: Up to 2,64,59,185 additional units representing 2.78% of unit capital
- **Total Potential Offer**: Up to 7,00,90,556 units representing 7.36% of unit capital
- **Seller**: Government of Singapore (public unitholder)
- **Offer Mechanism**: Stock exchange OFS mechanism via designated windows on BSE and NSE
- **Regulatory Framework**: SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD-PoD2/CIR/P/2024/00181 dated December 30, 2024
- **Investor Categories**: Separate sessions for non-retail and retail investors
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Not for release in United States except to Qualified Institutional Buyers

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. The OFS is conducted under existing framework:
- SEBI Master Circular for comprehensive guidelines on OFS (December 30, 2024)
- BSE Revised Operational Guidelines for OFS (notice 20240701-19 dated July 01, 2024)
- NSE Revised Operating Guidelines for OFS (circular 93/2024 dated July 12, 2024)

## Compliance Requirements

- **Bidders and Brokers**: Must read entire Notice along with OFS Guidelines before participating
- **Stock Exchanges**: Provide separate designated windows for the OFS
- **Seller**: Comply with disclosure requirements under OFS Guidelines including vital offer details
- **Geographic Compliance**: Restrictions on distribution in United States and other jurisdictions apply

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 04, 2026
- **T Day (Non-Retail Investors Only)**: February 05, 2026
- **T+1 Day (Retail Investors and Non-Retail with Un-allotted Bids)**: February 06, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The potential sale of up to 7.36% of IndiGrid Infrastructure Trust units represents a significant secondary market offering that could impact unit prices and trading volumes. The two-day offering structure allows both institutional and retail participation.

**Liquidity Impact**: The large block offering will increase unit float and may enhance liquidity in IndiGrid units, though could create short-term price pressure depending on demand.

**Investor Impact**: Retail investors get dedicated access on T+1 Day, while institutional investors can participate across both days. Non-retail investors with un-allotted bids can carry forward to T+1 Day.

**Strategic Significance**: Government of Singapore's divestment of up to 7.36% stake indicates portfolio rebalancing by a major institutional holder, which could signal changing investment priorities or capital allocation strategies.
