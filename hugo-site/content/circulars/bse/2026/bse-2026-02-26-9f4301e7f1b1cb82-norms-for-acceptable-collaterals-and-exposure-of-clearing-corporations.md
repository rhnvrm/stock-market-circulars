## Impact Assessment

- **Clearing Members & Custodians:** Must verify that bank guarantees or collateral instruments are only from the 34 listed banks. Any collateral from an unlisted bank would be non-compliant.
- **Banks:** Banks not on the list cannot be used for collateral with ICCL, potentially affecting business with clearing members.
- **Market Operations:** Minimal disruption expected as this appears to be a routine refresh; however, members must act promptly if any previously used bank has been removed.
- **Contact:** For queries, contact ICCL Risk Department – risk.monitoring@icclindia.com | +91-22-22728759/5733/8811/5059 (Sushant Majhi, Chief Risk Officer).
