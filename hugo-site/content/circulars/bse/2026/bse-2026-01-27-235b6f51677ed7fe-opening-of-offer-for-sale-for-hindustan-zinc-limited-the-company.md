**Ownership Structure**: Post-OFS, Vedanta Limited's promoter holding in Hindustan Zinc Limited will reduce by up to 1.58% (if greenshoe option is fully exercised), which may affect market perception of promoter commitment.

**Liquidity**: The OFS will provide institutional and retail investors an opportunity to acquire shares through the stock exchange mechanism, potentially improving free float and liquidity.

**Investor Categories**: The two-day structure allows non-retail investors to bid on T day with retail investors and carry-forward bids on T+1 day, ensuring broader participation across investor segments.
