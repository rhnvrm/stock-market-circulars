## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this affects a single privately placed debenture series. The part redemption reduces the outstanding face value per debenture, which is a routine corporate action. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face value for accurate pricing and settlement. No impact on broader debt market operations or trading in other securities.
