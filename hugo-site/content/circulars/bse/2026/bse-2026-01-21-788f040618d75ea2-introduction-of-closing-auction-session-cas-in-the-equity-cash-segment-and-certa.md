title: Introduction of Closing Auction Session (CAS) in the Equity Cash Segment and
  certain modifications in the Pre-Open Auction Session
---

## Summary

SEBI introduces Closing Auction Session (CAS) in the equity cash segment to determine closing prices through an auction mechanism instead of the current Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) method. Initially applicable to stocks with derivative contracts, CAS will operate from 3:15 PM to 3:35 PM as a separate 20-minute session. The closing price determined through CAS will be used for derivatives settlement, index computation, and mutual fund NAV determination. This change brings Indian markets in line with global practices and provides fairer, more transparent closing prices with aggregated liquidity.

## Key Points

- CAS will be implemented in phased manner - initially for stocks with derivative contracts available
- Current VWAP-based closing price (last 30 minutes) will be replaced by auction-based price discovery for derivative stocks
- Remaining securities will continue using VWAP method during transition
- CAS session duration: 20 minutes (3:15 PM to 3:35 PM)
- Order entry session closes randomly between 3:28 PM to 3:30 PM (system-driven)
- Equity derivatives segment continues to operate until 3:40 PM
- Post close session in cash segment: 3:50 PM to 4:00 PM (trades at closing price)
- CAS aggregates market interest into single liquidity pool for better execution of large orders
- Provides equal and transparent access to all investor categories
- Facilitates passive funds to transact at closing price, reducing tracking error
