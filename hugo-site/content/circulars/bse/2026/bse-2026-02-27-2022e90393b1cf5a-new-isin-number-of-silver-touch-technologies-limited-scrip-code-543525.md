## Summary

BSE has assigned a new ISIN number to Silver Touch Technologies Limited (Scrip Code: 543525) consequent to the sub-division (stock split) of its equity shares from a face value of Rs.10/- per share to Rs.2/- per share. The new ISIN is effective for all trades on and from the ex-date of March 6, 2026. This notice continues from Exchange Notice No. 20260220-50 dated February 20, 2026.

- DR Reference: DR-834/2025-2026
- Notice issued by: Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

Following the sub-division of equity shares, the existing ISIN is superseded by the new ISIN INE625X01026. Trading members and depositories must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN for Silver Touch Technologies Limited equity shares of Rs.2/- each.

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative update following a board-approved share sub-division. The new ISIN ensures continuity of trading in the post-split shares. Traders and investors holding Silver Touch Technologies shares should note the ISIN change to avoid settlement failures. The sub-division increases the number of shares in circulation while reducing the face value proportionally, potentially improving share liquidity.
