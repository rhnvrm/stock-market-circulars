## Impact Assessment

The impact of this circular is low. ESOP/ESOS listings are routine corporate actions representing employee share vesting. The number of shares being added is small relative to the total issued capital of each company. A summary of newly listed shares by company:

| Company | Scrip Code | ISIN | Shares Listed | Face Value (₹) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 360 One Wam Limited | 542772 | INE466L01038 | 3,84,008 | 1 |
| Aadhar Housing Finance Limited | 544176 | INE883F01010 | 7,96,299 | 10 |
| BlackBuck Limited | 544288 | INE0UIZ01018 | 1,81,071 | 1 |
| BlueStone Jewellery and Lifestyle Limited | 544484 | INE304W01038 | 65,494 | 1 |
| Fedbank Financial Services Limited | 544027 | INE007N01010 | 21,750 | 10 |
| HDFC Asset Management Company Limited | 541729 | INE127D01025 | 51,428 | 5 |
| Ideaforge Technology Limited | 543932 | INE349Y01013 | 7,026 | 10 |
| India Shelter Finance Corporation Limited | 544044 | INE922K01024 | 63,770 | 5 |
| Lenskart Solutions Limited | 544600 | INE956O01016 | 15,45,820 | 2 |
| Rose Merc. Limited | 512115 | INE649C01012 | 12,000 | 10 |
| Viyash Scientific Limited | 512529 | INE807F01027 | 1,13,001 | 2 |

Minor dilution of existing shareholders is expected but is negligible in most cases given the small proportion of new shares relative to total outstanding capital.
