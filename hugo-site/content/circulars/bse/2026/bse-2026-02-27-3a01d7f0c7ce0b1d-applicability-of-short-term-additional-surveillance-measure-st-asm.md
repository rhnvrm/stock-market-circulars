## Summary

BSE has issued a circular specifying changes to the Short Term (ST) Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework effective March 02, 2026. Eight securities are newly shortlisted under the ST 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework, no securities are moving to higher or lower stages, and twelve securities are exiting the framework — several due to inclusion in stricter frameworks such as Trade for Trade or LT-ASM.

## Key Points

- **8 securities newly added** to the ST 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework (Annexure I, Part A) w.e.f. March 02, 2026.
- **No securities** are being moved to a higher or lower ASM stage within the ST framework.
- **12 securities are exiting** the ST-ASM Framework (Annexure II), with varying reasons including inclusion in LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, and other surveillance frameworks.
- Annotations: Securities marked `*` are added/removed as per NSE; `@` denotes SME scrips; `**` denotes movement to Trade for Trade framework; `*` (in removal list) denotes movement to LT-ASM.
- A consolidated list of all securities currently under ST-ASM is provided in Annexure III.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Brokers and trading members** must apply applicable ST-ASM trading restrictions (margin requirements, price bands, trade-for-trade settlements) for the 8 newly included securities from March 02, 2026.
- **Investors and portfolio managers** holding positions in affected securities should review margin and settlement obligations under the ST-ASM framework.
- Securities moving out of ST-ASM due to Trade for Trade or LT-ASM inclusion remain under heightened surveillance — standard trading conditions do NOT apply until those frameworks also release the security.
- Refer to Annexure III (consolidated list) for the complete and current picture of all securities under ST-ASM and their respective stages (Stage I, II, etc.).

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** March 02, 2026 — all additions, stage changes, and removals take effect.
- **Circular Date:** February 27, 2026.

## Impact Assessment

- **Newly added securities** will face enhanced surveillance including higher margins, potential price band restrictions, and trade-for-trade settlement under the ST 5/15/30 Days ASM framework — this typically reduces liquidity and increases trading costs for retail and institutional participants.
- **6 of 12 exiting securities** are moving to stricter frameworks (Trade for Trade or LT-ASM), meaning their trading restrictions are escalating, not relaxing — investors should not interpret removal from ST-ASM as a sign of improved risk profile for these scrips.
- The **SME segment** is specifically impacted, with Shanti Spintex Ltd added and Accretion Nutraveda Ltd and Icon Facilitators Ltd exiting — SME stocks are generally less liquid, so ASM inclusion has an outsized impact.
- **Ratnamani Metals & Tubes Ltd** (a relatively well-known mid-cap) exiting ST-ASM with no noted escalation to another framework suggests a normalization of its trading pattern.
