## Regulatory Changes

**Reference Price Calculation:**

**Constituent Weighting Rules:**

## Compliance Requirements

- Compliance with minimum 65% REIT aggregate weight requirement for portfolio construction

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The methodology changes will affect index composition and weighting calculations, impacting passive funds and ETFs tracking the BSE REIT & INVIT Index. The shift in reference price date from Wednesday to Monday may result in different constituent weights compared to the previous methodology.

**Operational Impact:** Index fund managers will need to adjust their rebalancing processes to accommodate the new reference date and ensure compliance with the 65% minimum REIT weight requirement. The introduction of fast-tracked IPO provisions allows for more timely inclusion of significant new REIT/INVIT listings, potentially reducing tracking error for passive funds.

**Investment Impact:** The minimum 65% aggregate weight requirement for REITs ensures the index maintains its primary focus on real estate investment trusts while allowing INVIT exposure. Fast-track provisions improve index representativeness by enabling quicker inclusion of major new listings.
