## Important Dates

- **Effective Date for Reduced Face Value Trading:** February 25, 2026
- **Reference Number:** DR-828/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

The partial redemptions reduce the outstanding principal on these PTCs, directly lowering the face value at which they trade on the BSE debt market segment. Investors and trading members holding or transacting in these instruments must account for the new face values in valuations, settlement, and margin calculations. The impact is confined to participants in the structured debt/securitisation market and does not affect equity markets. The wide range of reduced face values reflects varying principal repayment amounts across the different Vajra Trust series.
