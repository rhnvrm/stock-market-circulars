## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective January 05, 2026. The circular details securities newly shortlisted in LT-ASM, securities moving between different ASM stages, and securities being removed from the framework. Three new securities have been added to LT-ASM, one security moves to higher stage, four securities move to lower stages, and twelve securities are being removed from the framework.

## Key Points

- 3 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Jackson Investments Ltd, Safa Systems & Technologies Ltd, and Samtel India Ltd
- Cupid Breweries And Distilleries Ltd moved to higher ASM Stage II while continuing in LT-ASM
- 4 securities moved to lower ASM stages: Bharat Global Developers Ltd and Espire Hospitality Limited to Stage I; NACL Industries Ltd and Sumeet Industries Ltd to Stage III
- No securities shortlisted in Direct Stage IV LT-ASM Framework
- 12 securities moving out of LT-ASM Framework including A B Infrabuild Ltd, Accedere Ltd, Gourmet Gateway India Ltd, Healthy Life Agritec Ltd, Mangalam Industrial Finance Ltd, Netweb Technologies India Ltd (both regular and T+0 scrips), Priya Ltd, Ratnabhumi Developers Ltd, Roni Households Ltd, Sunita Tools Ltd, and Vipul Ltd
- All changes effective from January 05, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The LT-ASM framework is being updated with movements across multiple categories:

**Part A - New Additions:** Three securities are being newly placed under Long Term ASM surveillance framework.

**Part B - Stage Upgrades:** Securities continuing in LT-ASM but moving to higher surveillance stages due to continued concerns.

**Part C - Stage Downgrades:** Securities showing improvement being moved to lower surveillance stages while remaining in framework.

**Part D - Direct Stage IV:** Lists securities directly placed in highest surveillance stage (currently nil).

**Removals:** Securities exiting LT-ASM due to inclusion in other frameworks like Trade for Trade, GSM Framework, ESM Framework, or IBC Framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of the revised LT-ASM status of affected securities
- Enhanced due diligence and surveillance applicable for securities in LT-ASM framework
- Different trading restrictions apply based on ASM stage (I, II, III, or IV)
- Special monitoring required for T+0 scrips shortlisted based on parent company criteria
- Members should note securities moved to other surveillance frameworks (Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, IBC) and follow respective framework requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** January 05, 2026 - All LT-ASM framework changes become applicable
- **Circular Date:** January 02, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects trading conditions and liquidity for 19 securities. Securities in LT-ASM framework typically face additional price bands, surveillance charges, and disclosure requirements which can impact trading volumes and investor participation.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading the affected securities will experience modified trading conditions. Securities moving to higher ASM stages face stricter surveillance while those moving out may see normalized trading conditions.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to update their surveillance systems and risk management frameworks to reflect the new LT-ASM classifications and ensure compliance with stage-specific requirements.

**Positive Developments:** 12 securities moving out of LT-ASM indicates improved compliance or inclusion in more appropriate frameworks. 4 securities downgraded to lower stages showing positive trends.
