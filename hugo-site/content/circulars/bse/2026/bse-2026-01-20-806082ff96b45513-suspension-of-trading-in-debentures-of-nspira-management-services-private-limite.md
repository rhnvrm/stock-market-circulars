- Record date for redemption: January 22, 2026
- No dealings permitted from: January 22, 2026
- Notice reference: DR-804/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

- Members must ensure compliance with the trading suspension directive
- All pending orders in the affected debentures should be cancelled or rejected

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 20, 2026
- **Record Date**: January 22, 2026
- **Trading Suspension Date**: January 22, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The suspension affects only a single series of privately placed debentures of a private limited company, which typically has limited secondary market trading activity.

**Investor Impact**: Minimal. Debenture holders will receive redemption proceeds as per the redemption terms. Only those attempting to trade on or after January 22, 2026 will be affected by the suspension.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to block trading in the specified ISIN from the suspension date.
