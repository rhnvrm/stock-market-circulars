## Impact Assessment

This listing represents a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment of 11.95 lakh shares to non-promoters pursuant to warrant conversion increases the company's equity base. The lock-in period until July 31, 2026 ensures these shares cannot be traded immediately, limiting short-term supply impact. The pari-passu ranking means the new shares have equal rights with existing shares. This is a standard capital-raising activity with no immediate trading implications beyond increased share count.
