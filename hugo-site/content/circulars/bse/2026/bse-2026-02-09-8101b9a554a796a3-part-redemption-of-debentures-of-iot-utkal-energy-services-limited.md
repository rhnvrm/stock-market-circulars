## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects debenture holders and traders of IOT UTKAL ENERGY SERVICES LIMITED debt securities

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the reduced face values for accurate pricing and settlement. The part redemption represents a routine debt servicing activity that reduces the outstanding principal amount of the debentures.

**Financial Impact**: Debenture holders will receive partial principal repayment along with interest payment as per the terms of the debentures. The reduced face values (Rs. 57,627.12 and Rs. 18,922) will be the new basis for all future trading and calculations.
