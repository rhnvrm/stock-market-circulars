## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: October 13, 2025

  - 10,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 20650001 to 20660000): July 29, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this represents a small preferential allotment (160,000 shares) issued through warrant conversion. The lock-in period until July 2026 restricts immediate liquidity of these shares. This is a routine corporate action affecting only the specific allottees and does not materially alter the company's capital structure or trading dynamics.
