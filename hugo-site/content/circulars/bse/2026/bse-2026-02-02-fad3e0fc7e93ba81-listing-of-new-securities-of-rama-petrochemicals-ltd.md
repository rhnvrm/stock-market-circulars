## Impact Assessment

The listing represents a capital infusion through preferential allotment to promoters via warrant conversion. With all shares subject to lock-in until August 2027, there will be no immediate tradable supply from this allotment. The issue represents approximately 11.98% dilution (assuming total pre-issue shares of around 1.05 crore based on distinctive numbers). Market impact is minimal due to the lock-in restriction and promoter nature of the allotment.
