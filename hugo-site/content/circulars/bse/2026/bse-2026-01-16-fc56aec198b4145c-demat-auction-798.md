## Regulatory Changes

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine settlement process that occurs regularly. The auction mechanism ensures orderly settlement of failed deliveries.

**Operational Impact:** Limited to specific brokers and clients who have delivery obligations for the listed scrips. The auction process will compel delivery or impose penalties as per exchange rules.

**Investor Impact:** Minimal for general investors. Only affects those who have outstanding delivery obligations in the listed scrips for this specific settlement cycle. Notable inclusions of high-profile stocks like CIPLA (50 shares), TATA STEEL (5 shares), and KOTAK MAHINDRA (320 shares) suggest some institutional or retail delivery failures that will be resolved through the auction mechanism.
