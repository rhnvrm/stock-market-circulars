## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must update their records to reflect the new share issuances
- Trading systems should be updated to accommodate the additional shares
- Companies must ensure proper disclosure of the diluted share capital in subsequent filings

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 06, 2026
- **Trading Commencement Date**: February 09, 2026 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Period**: Not Applicable (NA) for all listed securities

## Impact Assessment

The listing of these ESOP shares represents a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The total number of shares being listed (1.76 million) is relatively small compared to the existing market capitalization of these companies. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares are immediately tradable, though the impact on share prices is expected to be negligible given the small dilution percentages. This is a positive development for employee shareholders who can now trade their vested stock options on the exchange.
