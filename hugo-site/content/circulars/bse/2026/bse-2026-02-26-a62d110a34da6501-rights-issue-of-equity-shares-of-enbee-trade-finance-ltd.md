## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Circular Date | 26 February 2026 |

| Ex-Rights Basis Effective From | 04 March 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

This is a company-specific corporate action with moderate impact confined to existing shareholders and trading members dealing in ENBEE TRADE & FINANCE LTD. (512441). The rights ratio of 21:10 represents a significant dilution (210% issuance relative to existing holdings), which may exert downward price pressure on the ex-rights date. Shareholders need to evaluate whether to subscribe, renounce, or let rights lapse. The low face value (Re. 1/-) and at-par pricing indicate a minimal cash outlay per right, but the high ratio increases total exposure. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the ex-rights marker from 04/03/2026.
