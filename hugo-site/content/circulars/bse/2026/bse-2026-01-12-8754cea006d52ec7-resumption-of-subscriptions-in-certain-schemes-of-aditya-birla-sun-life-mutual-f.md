## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited has announced the resumption of fresh subscriptions and switch-in applications in three international equity schemes effective January 12, 2026. The schemes will accept subscriptions up to ₹1 crore per PAN per day across all transaction types including fresh purchase, additional purchase, and systematic transactions (SIP/STP).

## Key Points

- Fresh subscriptions and switch-ins recommenced from Monday, January 12, 2026
- Maximum subscription limit set at ₹1 crore per PAN per day
- Limit applies across all subscription transactions including fresh purchase, additional purchase, SIP, and STP
- Three schemes affected: Aditya Birla Sun Life International Equity Fund, Global Emerging Opportunities Fund, and Global Excellence Equity Fund of Fund
- ABSLAMC reserves right to modify maximum subscription amount in future
- Addendum number: 04/2026
- Notice dated: January 9, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

This is an operational modification to scheme subscription policies rather than a regulatory change. The AMC has exercised its discretion to reopen subscriptions that were previously restricted or closed.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors must adhere to the ₹1 crore per PAN per day subscription limit across all transaction types
- Distributors and platforms need to update their systems to enforce the daily subscription cap
- This addendum forms integral part of the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: Monday, January 12, 2026 - Resumption of fresh subscriptions
- **Notice Date**: January 9, 2026 - Date of official announcement

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This affects only investors in three specific international equity schemes of Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for investors seeking exposure to international equity markets through these schemes, as they can now make fresh investments subject to the daily limit. The ₹1 crore per PAN per day limit is substantial enough to accommodate most retail and HNI investors.

**Operational Impact**: Fund distributors and platforms need to update their systems to track and enforce the daily subscription limits per PAN across multiple transaction types.
