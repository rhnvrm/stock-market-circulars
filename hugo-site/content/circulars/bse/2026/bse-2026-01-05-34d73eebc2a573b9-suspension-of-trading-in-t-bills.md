title: Suspension of Trading in T-Bills - Three Securities Maturing January 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a suspension notice for trading in three Treasury Bills that are scheduled to mature on their redemption date. Trading members are instructed not to deal in these T-Bills effective January 6, 2026. This is a standard operational procedure for maturing government securities.

## Key Points

- Three T-Bills will be suspended from trading effective January 6, 2026
- Suspension is due to securities reaching their redemption/maturity date
- Notice issued under reference DR-792/2025-2026
- Applies to debt segment trading members

## Securities Affected

| Scrip Code | ISIN | Particulars |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 805089 | IN002025Y156 | 182TB80126 |
| 805012 | IN002024Z396 | 364TB80126 |
| 805127 | IN002025X281 | 91TB080126 |

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealings in the three specified T-Bills from January 6, 2026
- Members should update their trading systems to reflect the suspension
- No new positions should be opened in these securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 5, 2026
- **Suspension Effective Date**: January 6, 2026
- **Redemption Date**: On or around January 6, 2026 (implied)

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited and procedural in nature. This affects only debt market participants holding or trading these specific T-Bills. As this is a scheduled maturity event, market participants would have been aware of the redemption dates. The suspension ensures orderly settlement and prevents trading in securities about to be redeemed. No broader market disruption is expected as this is standard operating procedure for maturing government securities.
