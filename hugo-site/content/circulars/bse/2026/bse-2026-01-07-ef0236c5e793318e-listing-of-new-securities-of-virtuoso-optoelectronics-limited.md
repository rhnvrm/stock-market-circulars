## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are informed to note the listing of these new securities for trading purposes effective from the listing date.

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment**: November 7, 2025
- **Listing Date**: January 8, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry**: July 11, 2026 (for all 586,081 shares)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment represents capital raising through warrant conversion for Virtuoso Optoelectronics Limited. The lock-in period until July 11, 2026, restricts immediate trading of these shares. The listing expands the company's free float marginally and does not affect existing trading members' operations beyond awareness of the new securities.
