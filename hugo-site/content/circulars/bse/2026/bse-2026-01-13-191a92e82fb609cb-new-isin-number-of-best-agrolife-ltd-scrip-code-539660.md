title: New ISIN Number for Best Agrolife Ltd Following Share Sub-Division
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a new ISIN number INE052T01021 for Best Agrolife Ltd (Scrip Code: 539660) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs.10/- to Re.1/-. This change continues from the earlier notice dated January 06, 2026, and will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date of January 16, 2026.

## Key Points

- Company: Best Agrolife Ltd (Scrip Code: 539660)
- New ISIN Number: INE052T01021
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Old Face Value: Rs.10/- per share
- New Face Value: Re.1/- per share
- Ex-Date: January 16, 2026
- Document Reference: DR-800/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action where the company has sub-divided its equity shares, requiring issuance of a new ISIN to distinguish the new share denomination from the old one.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number INE052T01021
- All trades executed on or after January 16, 2026 must use the new ISIN
- Back-office systems, demat records, and trading platforms need to be configured to recognize the new share denomination
- Members should refer to the continuation notice from January 06, 2026 (Notice No. 20260106-25) for additional context

## Important Dates

- **January 06, 2026**: Original notice issued (Notice No. 20260106-25)
- **January 13, 2026**: New ISIN notification date
- **January 16, 2026**: Ex-date - new ISIN becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division increases the number of outstanding shares by 10x while proportionally reducing the price, making shares more affordable for retail investors. This could potentially improve liquidity and trading volumes.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members, custodians, and depositories must ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN before the ex-date to avoid trade disruptions. Existing shareholders will see their holdings adjusted automatically in demat accounts.

**Investor Impact**: Low to Medium - Existing shareholders' total investment value remains unchanged as they receive 10 shares for every 1 share held. The psychological impact of lower per-share price may attract more retail participation.
