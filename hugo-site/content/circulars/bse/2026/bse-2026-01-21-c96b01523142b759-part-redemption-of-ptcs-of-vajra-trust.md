## Impact Assessment

This corporate action affects debt market participants holding or trading Vajra Trust PTCs. The partial redemption returns capital to investors while reducing the outstanding face value of the securities. Trading members must ensure their systems reflect the updated face values to maintain accurate pricing and settlement. The action is routine for pass-through certificate structures where periodic principal repayments reduce face values over the life of the securities.
