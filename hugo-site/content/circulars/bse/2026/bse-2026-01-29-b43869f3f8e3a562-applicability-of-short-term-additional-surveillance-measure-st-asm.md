## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to apply short-term surveillance measures for 5/15/30 day periods to securities demonstrating price volatility or unusual trading patterns. Securities may exit ST-ASM if they move to other surveillance frameworks including LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge Framework, or ESM Framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the changed surveillance status of affected securities
- Trading in newly listed ST-ASM securities will be subject to enhanced surveillance measures
- Brokers and traders should adjust their risk management systems for the affected securities
- Additional margin requirements and position limits may apply to ST-ASM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 30, 2026 - All changes to ST-ASM framework take effect

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of 10 securities in ST-ASM will result in enhanced trading restrictions and monitoring for these stocks, potentially affecting their liquidity and trading volumes. The exit of 7 securities from the framework indicates improved price stability or movement to other surveillance categories. Market participants trading in these securities should be aware of the changed surveillance status and adjust their trading strategies accordingly. The framework helps maintain market integrity by identifying and monitoring securities with abnormal price movements.
