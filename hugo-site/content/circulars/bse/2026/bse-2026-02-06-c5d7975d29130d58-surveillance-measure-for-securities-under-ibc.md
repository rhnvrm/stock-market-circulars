## Summary

BSE has issued surveillance measures for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) framework, effective February 09, 2026. Five companies have been shortlisted in Stage 1 of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) for companies under Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP). The circular provides annexures listing securities at different stages of IBC surveillance and a consolidated list of all securities currently under the IBC framework.

## Key Points

- Five securities moved to Stage 1 ASM under IBC: Aanchal Ispat Ltd, Axis Solutions Ltd, Maxgrow India Ltd, Spentex Industries Ltd, and Steelco Gujarat Ltd
- No securities moved from Stage 1 to Stage 2 or from Stage 2 to Stage 1
- No securities moved to Stage 0 (Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure)
- No securities excluded from ASM for IBC
- Consolidated list includes 13+ securities under various stages of IBC surveillance
- Framework includes special marking for T+0 scrips and recommencement scrips

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements BSE's Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework specifically for companies undergoing Insolvency Resolution Process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The framework has multiple stages:

- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company regarding IBC proceedings
- **Stage 1**: Active Additional Surveillance Measure for companies in IRP under IBC
- **Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance for companies continuing in IRP

Special categories are marked with symbols:
- (*) indicates securities aligned with NSE measures
- (~) indicates T+0 scrips shortlisted in IBC framework as per parent company
- (^) indicates recommencement scrips

## Compliance Requirements

**For Listed Companies:**
- Companies under IBC proceedings must ensure timely disclosure of insolvency-related developments
- Compliance with enhanced disclosure requirements under the surveillance framework

**For Trading Members:**
- Monitor securities under IBC surveillance for additional risk management
- Apply appropriate margin requirements for securities in different IBC stages
- Inform clients about surveillance status and associated risks

**For Investors:**
- Exercise heightened caution when trading securities under IBC surveillance
- Understand the insolvency status and potential outcomes for invested companies
- Be aware of potential trading restrictions or limitations

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 09, 2026 - All surveillance measures become applicable
- **Circular Date**: February 06, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Securities under IBC surveillance typically experience reduced liquidity and investor interest
- Price discovery may be impaired due to uncertainty around insolvency resolution outcomes
- Five companies moving to Stage 1 face enhanced scrutiny and potential trading restrictions

**Operational Impact:**
- Companies in Stage 1 ASM under IBC face operational restrictions and creditor-driven management
- Resolution process outcomes could range from restructuring to liquidation
- Timeline for resolution typically extends over several months to years

**Investor Impact:**
- High risk of capital loss for equity investors in companies under IRP
- Trading in these securities subject to additional risk warnings and surveillance measures
- Limited price appreciation potential until successful resolution
- Consolidated list provides transparency for investors to identify all securities under IBC framework

**Systemic Impact:**
- Surveillance framework helps protect market integrity by flagging distressed companies
- Provides early warning system for investors about companies in financial difficulty
- Aligns BSE surveillance with IBC framework for consistent treatment of insolvency cases
