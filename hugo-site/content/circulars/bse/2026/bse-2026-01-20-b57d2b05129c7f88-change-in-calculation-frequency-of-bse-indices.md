Market participants relying on intraday index movements for these specific indices will no longer have access to real-time values.

**Operational Impact**: Market participants, data vendors, and financial product providers using these indices will need to adjust their systems and expectations. Index funds and ETFs tracking these indices, algorithmic trading strategies, and real-time portfolio monitoring systems may be affected.

**Data Availability**: Intraday index values will no longer be available for BSE Largecap, Midcap, and Smallcap indices after January 27, 2026. Only end-of-day values will be published.

**Note**: BSE Sensex and other major indices not mentioned in this circular continue to be calculated in real-time.
