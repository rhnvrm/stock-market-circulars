## Impact Assessment

This preferential allotment represents a significant capital raise by Adani Ports through promoter investment. The issuance of over 14.38 crore shares at Rs. 1199/- per share represents substantial capital infusion. The 18-month lock-in period on all shares provides stability and demonstrates promoter commitment. Existing shareholders should note the dilution impact, though the pari-passu ranking ensures equal rights. The premium pricing at Rs. 1197/- over face value indicates strong valuation and promoter confidence in the company's prospects.
