## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of over 514 million new equity shares represents a substantial increase in the share capital of Allcargo Logistics Limited, likely resulting from a corporate restructuring involving multiple group entities. This will significantly dilute existing shareholding percentages and increase the free float, potentially affecting liquidity and price discovery.

**Operational Impact**: The composite scheme of arrangement consolidates multiple Allcargo group entities (Allcargo Supply Chain Private Limited, Gati Express and Supply Chain Private Limited, Allcargo Gati Limited, and Allcargo ECU Limited), indicating a major corporate restructuring. This may streamline operations and simplify the group structure.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders' ownership percentages will be diluted due to the large number of new shares issued. However, the scheme of arrangement likely provides proportional benefits to existing shareholders. Investors should review the scheme document for detailed shareholding implications.
