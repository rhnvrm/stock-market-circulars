## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine monthly settlement schedule that enables orderly trading and settlement operations in the ITP-SME segment.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Trading members and clearing members need to plan their operations according to the published schedule. The special timing arrangements on February 2 and 20 accommodate weekend settlements and require attention to modified deadlines.

**Participant Impact**: All ITP-SME segment participants must follow this schedule for trade execution and settlement obligations. The evening settlement windows on February 2 and 20 provide additional flexibility for settlement completion before extended weekends.
