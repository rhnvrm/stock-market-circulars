## Impact Assessment

This is a routine preferential allotment listing with limited broad market impact. The addition of 10,50,000 shares increases the tradable float of Rudra Ecovation Limited; however, the entire allotment is subject to lock-in until October 1, 2026, meaning these shares will not be available for trading in the secondary market until that date. Existing shareholders may see a minor dilution effect. No systemic or sector-wide impact is anticipated.
