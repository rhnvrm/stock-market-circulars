## Summary

BSE has listed 1,00,00,000 (1 crore) new equity shares of Leading Leasing Finance and Investment Co. Limited (Scrip Code: 540360) issued to non-promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to warrant conversion. Trading in these new securities will commence from January 8, 2026. The shares carry a lock-in period until July 14, 2026.

## Key Points

- 1 crore equity shares of Rs. 1/- each issued at premium of Rs. 6.40/- per share
- Issue price: Rs. 7.40/- per share
- Allotted to non-promoters on preferential basis through warrant conversion
- Distinctive Numbers: 553565501 to 563565500
- ISIN: INE715Q01029
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares
- Trading effective from January 8, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following SEBI preferential allotment regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the new securities listing for Leading Leasing Finance and Investment Co. Limited
- Lock-in restrictions must be enforced on all 1 crore shares until the specified lock-in expiry date
- Shares cannot be transferred or traded until lock-in period expires

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment**: November 25, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: January 8, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry**: July 14, 2026 (all 1,00,00,000 shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine listing of preferentially allotted shares through warrant conversion. The 1 crore new shares represent capital infusion but are subject to lock-in restrictions until mid-2026, limiting immediate market liquidity impact.

**Company Impact**: The preferential allotment at Rs. 7.40/- per share raises approximately Rs. 7.40 crores for the company, strengthening its capital base. The allotment to non-promoters may marginally dilute promoter holding.

**Trading Impact**: Minimal immediate impact as all shares are locked-in for approximately 6 months. Post lock-in expiry in July 2026, additional supply may affect stock liquidity and price discovery.
