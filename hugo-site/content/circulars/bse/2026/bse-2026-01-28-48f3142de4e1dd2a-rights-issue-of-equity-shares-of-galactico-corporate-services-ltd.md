## Summary

GALACTICO CORPORATE SERVICES LTD (Scrip Code: 542802) has announced a rights issue of equity shares with a record date of January 31, 2026. The company will issue 23 equity shares of Re.1/- each for every 100 equity shares held, at an issue price of Re.1.75 per share (face value Re.1/- plus premium of Re.0.75). Trading in the company's equity shares will be conducted on an ex-rights basis from January 30, 2026 (Settlement No. DR-809/2025-2026).

- Total issue price: Re.1.75 per share
- Entire issue price payable at time of application
- Scrip Code: 542802

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action announcement under existing BSE regulations for rights issues.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must execute transactions on ex-rights basis from the specified date
- Full payment of Re.1.75 per share required at time of application
- Trading members must note the record date and ex-rights date for proper settlement

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: January 31, 2026
- **Ex-Rights Date**: January 30, 2026
- **Settlement Number**: DR-809/2025-2026
- **Notice Date**: January 28, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This rights issue will allow existing shareholders of GALACTICO CORPORATE SERVICES LTD to subscribe to additional equity shares in proportion to their holdings. The relatively small entitlement ratio (23:100) suggests a modest capital raising exercise. The ex-rights trading from January 30, 2026 will reflect the dilution effect on share price. Shareholders who do not participate will experience dilution of their ownership percentage. Trading members need to ensure proper handling of ex-rights transactions during the specified settlement period.
