## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that Rights Entitlements (REs) for Renunciation of ONIX SOLAR ENERGY LIMITED (Scrip Code: 751090, Scrip ID: ONIX-RE) will be available for trading on the Exchange effective Thursday, February 26, 2026. The Rights Issue itself is open from February 26 to March 6, 2026, while the trading window for renunciation of REs runs from February 26 to March 2, 2026.

## Key Points

- Rights Entitlements (REs) for ONIX SOLAR ENERGY LIMITED are permitted for trading on BSE from February 26, 2026
- Scrip Code: 751090 | Scrip ID: ONIX-RE | ISIN: INE173M20012
- Market Lot: 1 | Group: R
- REs shall be settled on T+1 Rolling Settlement on a trade-for-trade basis
- REs are tradable in dematerialized form only
- REs that are neither subscribed nor renounced before the Issue Closing Date shall lapse and be extinguished
- Trading members must prominently inform clients that purchase of REs does not constitute purchase of ordinary shares

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular operationalizes existing BSE framework for rights entitlement trading as outlined in prior notices: 20200305-21 (March 5, 2020) and 20200518-34 (May 18, 2020).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform all clients about the commencement of trading in REs, specifying ISIN INE173M20012
- Members must clarify to clients that REs should not be mistaken for ordinary shares of ONIX SOLAR ENERGY LIMITED
- Contract notes and bills for RE purchases must prominently include a disclaimer stating that purchase of REs only grants the right to participate in the ongoing Rights Issue or renounce REs before the issue closes
- Members must ensure clients are aware that unsubscribed and unrenounced REs will lapse after the Issue Closing Date

## Important Dates

- **February 26, 2026**: Rights Issue opens; RE trading for renunciation commences
- **March 2, 2026**: Last day for trading in Rights Entitlements (RE renunciation window closes)
- **March 6, 2026**: Rights Issue closes; unsubscribed/unrenounced REs lapse after this date

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a moderate and company-specific impact, primarily affecting existing shareholders of ONIX SOLAR ENERGY LIMITED and trading members facilitating RE transactions. The T+1 trade-for-trade settlement mechanism reduces counterparty risk but limits netting benefits. Investors wishing to renounce their rights have a narrow 5-day trading window (February 26 to March 2, 2026). Trading members face compliance obligations to properly disclose the nature of REs to clients to prevent confusion with ordinary equity shares.
