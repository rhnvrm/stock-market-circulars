## Impact Assessment

The listing represents a significant corporate restructuring involving the amalgamation of 10 companies into Viyash Scientific Ltd. The issuance of approximately 18.19 crore shares substantially increases the company's equity base. Since the shares rank pari-passu with existing shares, existing shareholders' rights remain protected. The amalgamation consolidates operations across multiple pharmaceutical and life sciences entities, potentially creating operational synergies. Market participants should note the substantial increase in share capital when evaluating trading volumes and liquidity. The name change from Sequent Scientific Ltd to Viyash Scientific Ltd reflects the post-merger identity.
