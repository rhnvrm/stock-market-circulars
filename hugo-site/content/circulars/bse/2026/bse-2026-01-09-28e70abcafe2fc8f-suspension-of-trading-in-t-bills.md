## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading for three Treasury Bills (T-Bills) effective January 12, 2026, as they approach their redemption dates. The suspended T-Bills include a 364-day T-Bill (ISIN: IN002024Z404), a 182-day T-Bill (ISIN: IN002025Y164), and a 91-day T-Bill (ISIN: IN002025X299). Trading members are advised not to deal in these instruments from the specified date.

## Key Points

- Three T-Bills with different tenures (364-day, 182-day, and 91-day) will be suspended from trading
- Suspension effective from January 12, 2026
- Notice issued under DR-796/2025-2026
- Applies to debt segment trading members

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational notice for T-Bill maturity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified T-Bills from January 12, 2026 onwards
- Members should update their trading systems to prevent inadvertent trading in these instruments
- Affected T-Bills:
  - Scrip Code 805015 (ISIN: IN002024Z404) - 364TB15126
  - Scrip Code 805092 (ISIN: IN002025Y164) - 182TB15126

## Important Dates

- **Trading Suspension Date:** January 12, 2026
- **Redemption Date:** On or after January 15, 2026 (implied from suspension date)

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and traders of the three specific T-Bills mentioned. This is a routine administrative action associated with the normal maturity cycle of government securities. Trading members dealing in the debt segment should ensure their systems are updated to prevent trading in these instruments post-suspension. No broader market impact is expected as this is part of the standard T-Bill lifecycle management.
