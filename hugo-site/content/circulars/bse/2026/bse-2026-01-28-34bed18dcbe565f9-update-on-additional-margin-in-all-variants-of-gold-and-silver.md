title: Update on Additional Margin in All Variants of Gold and Silver
---

## Summary

ICCL has issued a modification to circular no. 20251125-3 dated November 3, 2025, continuing additional margin requirements on Gold and Silver commodity derivatives contracts during their respective tender periods. The additional margin of 4.5% continues for Silver variants and 1% for Gold variants as part of periodic risk management review to mitigate systemic risk.

## Key Points

- Additional margins will continue to be levied during tender periods for specified contracts
- Silver contracts (SILVERKG, SILVERM, SILVER) expiring January 30 and February 5, 2026: 4.5% additional margin
- Gold contracts (GOLD, GOLDM) expiring February 5, 2026: 1% additional margin
- This is a modification of previous circular dated November 3, 2025
- Measure implemented as part of periodic review of risk management adequacy

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular modifies and continues the additional margin framework previously established in ICCL circular no. 20251125-3 dated November 3, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Clearing Members and Participants must ensure additional margins are maintained for affected contracts
- Members must account for 4.5% additional margin on Silver variants during tender period
- Members must account for 1% additional margin on Gold variants during tender period
- Compliance required in accordance with ICCL Rules, Bye-laws, and Regulations

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 28, 2026
- **SILVERKG Expiry**: January 30, 2026 (4.5% additional margin during tender period)
- **SILVERM Expiry**: January 30, 2026 (4.5% additional margin during tender period)
- **SILVER Expiry**: February 5, 2026 (4.5% additional margin during tender period)
- **GOLD Expiry**: February 5, 2026 (1% additional margin during tender period)
- **GOLDM Expiry**: February 5, 2026 (1% additional margin during tender period)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Moderate impact on commodity derivatives market participants trading Gold and Silver contracts. The continuation of additional margins affects liquidity and capital requirements for positions held during tender periods.

**Operational Impact**: Members must ensure adequate margin funding for positions in affected contracts. The differential margin rates (4.5% for Silver vs 1% for Gold) reflect different risk profiles of these precious metals.

**Risk Management**: This measure is designed to mitigate systemic risk during tender periods when physical delivery obligations crystallize, protecting the clearing system from default risk during critical settlement phases.
