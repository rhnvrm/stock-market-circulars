## Summary

BSE has announced the listing and permission to trade for 1,92,50,000 new equity shares of S.A.L. Steel Ltd. (Scrip Code: 532604, ISIN: INE658G01014), issued at Rs. 18/- per share on a preferential basis to non-promoters. These shares are available for trading on the Exchange with effect from Wednesday, February 25, 2026.

## Key Points

- 1,92,50,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- face value issued at a premium of Rs. 8/- (issue price Rs. 18/-) to non-promoters on preferential basis
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares of the company
- Distribution numbers: 84966701 to 104216700
- Date of allotment: October 30, 2025
- ISIN: INE658G01014
- All 1,92,50,000 shares are subject to a lock-in period until August 30, 2027

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification for newly issued securities pursuant to a preferential allotment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new listing and must ensure these securities are available for trading from February 25, 2026
- Lock-in restrictions apply to all 1,92,50,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 84966701 to 104216700) until August 30, 2027; trading of these shares is restricted during the lock-in period

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** October 30, 2025
- **Trading Effective From:** February 25, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry:** August 30, 2027

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action. The listing of 1,92,50,000 preferentially allotted shares increases the total share count of S.A.L. Steel Ltd. The lock-in period until August 2027 restricts these shares from being traded, limiting immediate dilution impact on existing shareholders. Market impact is expected to be minimal as this is a standard preferential allotment disclosure.
