## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - SLB participants need to adjust their lending and borrowing strategies to account for the shut periods. Those with existing positions should be aware of the restrictions on new transactions.

**Sector Coverage**: The circular affects multiple sectors including IT services (Zensar, Wipro), power generation (NLC India), banking (Bank of Maharashtra, Central Bank of India), and financial services (Angel One), indicating broad market coverage of the restrictions.
