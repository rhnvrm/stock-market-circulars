## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:**
The revised price bands will affect intraday price movement limits for these 30 securities. Securities with tighter bands (2-5%) will have more restricted price movements, potentially reducing volatility but also limiting trading opportunities. Securities with wider bands (20%) will allow greater price discovery.

**Market Participants:**
Traders and investors in these securities need to be aware of the new daily price limits. Day traders and algorithmic trading strategies may need adjustment based on the new volatility constraints.

**Surveillance Rationale:**
The varying price bands suggest different levels of surveillance concerns across securities, with tighter bands indicating higher regulatory oversight for price stability and investor protection.
