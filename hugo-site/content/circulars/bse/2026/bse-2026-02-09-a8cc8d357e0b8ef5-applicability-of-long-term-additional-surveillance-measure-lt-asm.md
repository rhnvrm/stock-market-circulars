BSE has issued updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective February 10, 2026. Two new securities have been shortlisted for inclusion in the LT-ASM framework: Delta Industrial Resources Ltd and Stratmont Industries Ltd. Additionally, Neopolitan Pizza And Foods Ltd will continue in the framework but will be moved to a higher ASM Stage II. No securities are being moved out of the LT-ASM framework at this time.

- No securities being removed from LT-ASM framework
- Changes effective from February 10, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework, which is designed to alert investors about securities that have witnessed unusual price movements and abnormal trading volumes. Securities under LT-ASM are subject to additional surveillance and trading restrictions based on their stage classification (Stage I through Stage IV).

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of securities newly included in LT-ASM framework
- Trading in these securities will be subject to ASM framework restrictions including potential price bands, additional margins, and other surveillance measures
- Investors and traders should exercise caution when dealing with securities under surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 10, 2026 - All changes to LT-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The inclusion of new securities and stage escalation will result in increased trading restrictions and margin requirements for affected stocks. This is intended to protect investors from potential volatility and ensure orderly trading.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading in Delta Industrial Resources Ltd, Stratmont Industries Ltd, and Neopolitan Pizza And Foods Ltd will face enhanced surveillance measures including possible reduced position limits, higher margins, and trade-for-trade settlement.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members must update their systems to reflect the new ASM classifications and ensure appropriate risk controls are in place for these securities.
