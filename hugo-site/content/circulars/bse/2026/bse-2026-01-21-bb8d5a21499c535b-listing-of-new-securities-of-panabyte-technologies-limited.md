## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following preferential allotment procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new securities and lock-in restrictions for Panabyte Technologies Limited.

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: October 18, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The listing represents approximately 21.8% increase in issued capital (from estimated 54,95,000 to 66,90,000 shares based on distribution numbers). The preferential allotment to non-promoters may result in dilution of existing shareholding. Lock-in restrictions ensure these shares cannot be traded until July 31, 2026, limiting immediate market impact. This is a routine corporate action with minimal impact on overall market operations.
