title: Withdrawal of Additional Margin in All Variants of Gold and Silver
---

## Summary

The Indian Clearing Corporation Limited (ICCL) has announced the withdrawal of additional margins levied on gold and silver futures contracts. The additional margin of 1% on all variants of GOLD contracts and 4.5% on all variants of SILVER contracts for near-month futures will be withdrawn effective trade date February 2, 2026. This follows ICCL circular number 20260128-2 dated January 28, 2026.

## Key Points

- Additional margin of 1% in GOLD contract (all variants) will be withdrawn
- Additional margin of 4.5% in SILVER contract (all variants) will be withdrawn
- Withdrawal applies to near-month future contracts only
- Effective from trade date February 2, 2026
- Issued by Chief Risk Officer - Risk Management Department

## Regulatory Changes

The withdrawal of additional margins represents a reversal of previously imposed risk mitigation measures. This reduces the overall margin requirements for trading near-month gold and silver futures contracts on the BSE commodity derivatives segment.

## Compliance Requirements

Members and participants trading in gold and silver futures contracts should:
- Update their margin calculation systems to reflect the reduced margin requirements
- Adjust risk management frameworks accordingly
- Note the effective date of February 2, 2026 for implementation
- Contact ICCL Risk Management Department for any clarifications at risk.monitoring@icclindia.com or +91-22-2272 5186/8902

## Important Dates

- **January 28, 2026**: Reference circular (20260128-2) on additional margin update
- **January 31, 2026**: Notice date for margin withdrawal announcement
- **February 2, 2026**: Effective date for withdrawal of additional margins

## Impact Assessment

The withdrawal of additional margins will reduce the overall cost of trading gold and silver futures contracts for market participants. This is expected to:
- Improve liquidity in near-month gold and silver futures
- Reduce capital requirements for traders and hedgers
- Lower barriers to entry for commodity derivatives trading
- Potentially increase trading volumes in these contracts
- Reflect improved market conditions or reduced volatility assessment by ICCL risk management
