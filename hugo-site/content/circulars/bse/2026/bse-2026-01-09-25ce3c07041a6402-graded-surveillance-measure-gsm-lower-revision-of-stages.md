title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Lower Revision of Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the downward revision of Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages for 56 securities. The revision includes 29 securities moving from Stage 1 to Stage 0 (complete removal from GSM framework) and 27 securities moving from higher stages (Stage 2 and Stage 3) to lower stages. This indicates improved performance or compliance by these companies under the surveillance framework.

## Key Points

- 29 securities moving from Stage 1 to Stage 0 (complete exit from GSM)
- 21 securities moving from Stage 2 to Stage 1
- 6 securities moving from Stage 3 to Stage 2
- Securities span across multiple groups including X, XT, Z, ZP, B, T, and P
- Notable security: Noida Toll Bridge Company Ltd. (Group B) moving from Stage 1 to Stage 0

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members should note the revised GSM stages for affected securities
- Updated margin and trading parameters will apply as per the new GSM stage
- Market participants should refer to BSE's GSM framework guidelines for specific restrictions applicable to each stage
- Companies must continue to maintain compliance standards to avoid re-entry into higher GSM stages

- Effective Date: As specified in the circular (typically immediate or next trading day)
