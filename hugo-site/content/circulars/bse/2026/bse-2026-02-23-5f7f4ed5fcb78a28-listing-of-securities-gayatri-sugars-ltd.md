## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Date of Allotment | January 11, 2025 |
| BSE Notice Date | February 23, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

The listing of 66,10,007 shares at Rs. 10.00/- face value represents a relatively modest equity expansion for Gayatri Sugars Ltd. Since the entire tranche is under lock-in until September 15, 2026, there is no immediate free-float impact or selling pressure in the near term. Trading members should note the new share block in the distribution range 67693634–74303640. Market impact is expected to be minimal given the lock-in restriction and the at-par issue price.
