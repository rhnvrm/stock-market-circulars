## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a company-specific corporate action affecting only the debenture holders of KEERTANA FINSERV LIMITED. The part redemption reduces the outstanding face value of the debentures to Rs. 50,000 per unit.

**Investor Impact**: Moderate for affected debenture holders - Holders on record date will receive partial redemption proceeds along with interest payment. Post-redemption, the face value and corresponding interest payments will be based on the reduced face value.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the reduced face value from the effective date. Standard settlement procedures apply under the designated settlement number.
