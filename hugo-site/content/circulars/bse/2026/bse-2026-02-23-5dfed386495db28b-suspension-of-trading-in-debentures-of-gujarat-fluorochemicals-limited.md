title: Suspension of Trading in Debentures of Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited
---

## Summary

BSE has directed trading members not to deal in the Non-Convertible Debentures of Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited with effect from March 4, 2026, ahead of the fixed record date for redemption and interest payment on the debenture series GFL-8.52%-20-3-26-PVT (ISIN: INE09N307018, Code: 974687).

## Key Points

- Trading in debentures of Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited (ISIN: INE09N307018, BSE Code: 974687) is suspended from March 4, 2026.
- The debenture series is identified as GFL-8.52%-20-3-26-PVT, carrying a coupon rate of 8.52%.
- Record date is fixed as March 4, 2026 for both redemption of debentures and payment of interest.
- Notice reference: DR-832/2025-2026, BSE Notice No. 20260223-39.
- All trading members on the Exchange's Debt segment are required to comply.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational notice under BSE's listing compliance framework requiring suspension of trading in a specific debenture series prior to its record date.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease dealing in the debentures of Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited (ISIN: INE09N307018 / Code: 974687) from March 4, 2026 onwards.
- Members should update their systems and alert desks to block transactions in this ISIN on or after the record date.

## Important Dates

- **February 23, 2026**: BSE notice issued.
- **March 4, 2026**: Record date for redemption and interest payment; no dealings permitted from this date.

## Impact Assessment

The suspension affects only holders and prospective traders of the specific NCD series (GFL-8.52%-20-3-26-PVT) in the debt market segment. The debenture is due for full redemption on or around March 20, 2026 (as indicated by the series name), so this suspension is a routine pre-redemption measure with limited broader market impact. Existing holders will receive redemption proceeds and final interest as per the company's schedule.
