## Impact Assessment

The listing of only 227 shares has negligible market impact given ICICI Bank's large total share capital. These shares were previously withheld (kept in abeyance) due to disputes or pending legal/corporate matters and are now resolved. The distinctive number allocations across 9 tranches (ranging from 5 to 100 shares each) suggest these belong to multiple individual shareholders whose abeyance conditions have been cleared.
