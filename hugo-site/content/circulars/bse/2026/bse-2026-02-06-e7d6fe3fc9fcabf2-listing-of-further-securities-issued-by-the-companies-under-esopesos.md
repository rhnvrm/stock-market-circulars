## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. These are routine ESOP/ESOS conversions representing employee stock option exercises. The share quantities are relatively small compared to the existing float of these companies. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares are immediately tradeable, but the employee nature of the issuance typically results in gradual market absorption rather than immediate selling pressure.
