**Market Impact**: Medium - affects existing shareholders and potential investors of DR Lalchandani Labs Limited who wish to participate in the rights issue or trade the rights entitlements.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure proper client communication, include mandatory disclaimers in contract notes, and handle T+1 trade-for-trade settlement for REs. Investors must understand the distinction between REs and ordinary shares, and be aware that unexercised/unrenounced REs will lapse after the issue closing date.
