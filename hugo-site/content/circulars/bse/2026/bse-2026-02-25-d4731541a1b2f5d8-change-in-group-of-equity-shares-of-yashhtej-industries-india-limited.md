## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that the equity shares of YASHHTEJ INDUSTRIES (INDIA) LIMITED (SME IPO, Scrip Code: 544708) will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to the Rolling segment (M Group) with effect from Thursday, March 12, 2026. This notice is in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20260224-17 dated February 24, 2026.

## Key Points

- Scrip Code: 544708 — YASHHTEJ INDUSTRIES (INDIA) LIMITED (SME IPO)
- Transfer from: Trade for Trade segment (MT Group)
- Transfer to: Rolling segment (M Group)
- Effective date: Thursday, March 12, 2026
- Continuation of prior notice: BSE Notice No. 20260224-17 dated February 24, 2026
- Contact person: Mr. Anurag Jain, Tel: 022-2272 8822

## Regulatory Changes

The equity shares of YASHHTEJ INDUSTRIES (INDIA) LIMITED will move from the restrictive Trade for Trade (MT Group) settlement to the standard Rolling settlement (M Group). In the Trade for Trade segment, each trade must result in delivery; no netting or speculative positions are permitted. The shift to Rolling segment allows normal trading with netting of positions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new group classification (M Group) for Scrip Code 544708 effective March 12, 2026.
- No delivery-mandatory restrictions will apply post-transfer; standard Rolling segment rules will govern settlement.
- Members should note the change in settlement obligations applicable from the effective date.

## Important Dates

- **February 24, 2026**: Original notice (BSE Notice No. 20260224-17) issued
- **February 25, 2026**: Current notice issued confirming transfer details
- **March 12, 2026**: Effective date of transfer from MT Group to M Group (Rolling segment)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine post-SME-IPO segment migration. The transfer from Trade for Trade (MT Group) to Rolling segment (M Group) improves liquidity for the stock by allowing position netting and removing the compulsory delivery constraint. Impact is limited to traders and investors in YASHHTEJ INDUSTRIES (INDIA) LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544708). This change is standard practice for SME IPO stocks after the initial mandatory Trade for Trade period concludes.
