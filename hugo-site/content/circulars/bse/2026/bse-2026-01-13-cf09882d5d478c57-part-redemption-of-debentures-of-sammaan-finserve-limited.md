## Impact Assessment

This is a standard debt corporate action involving part redemption of approximately 60% of the original face value (Rs. 600 out of Rs. 1,000). Debenture holders will receive partial redemption proceeds along with accrued interest. The reduced face value will affect future interest calculations and trading prices. Trading members need to ensure proper system updates to handle the face value change for accurate position tracking and settlement.
