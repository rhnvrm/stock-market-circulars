## Impact Assessment

The part redemption reduces the face value of each debenture from its original amount to Rs. 4,68,750, directly affecting the market price and settlement value of the instrument. Trading members and debenture holders must account for the revised face value in portfolio valuations and trade settlements from 27 February 2026 onwards. The impact is limited to holders of this specific privately placed NCD and does not affect broader equity markets.
