## Summary

BSE has published the demat auction settlement list for Settlement No. 802 dated January 21, 2026. This auction involves 140 different scrips with specific quantities of securities that need to be settled through the demat auction mechanism. The auction covers a diverse range of companies across various sectors including banking, manufacturing, infrastructure, mutual funds, and consumer goods.

## Key Points

- Settlement Number: 802
- Settlement Date: January 21, 2026
- Total number of scrips involved: 140 scrips
- Quantities range from 1 share to 20,000 shares depending on the scrip
- Covers equity shares across multiple sectors and market capitalizations

- Also includes mutual fund units from 360 ONE and other asset managers

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced in this circular. This is a standard operational notification for demat auction settlement.

## Compliance Requirements

- Concerned brokers and clearing members must deliver the specified quantities of securities as per the auction settlement
- Participants must ensure timely delivery of securities to complete the settlement process
- All deliveries must be made in demat form through the depository system
- Settlement obligations must be fulfilled as per BSE's clearing and settlement regulations

## Important Dates

- **Settlement Date:** January 21, 2026
- **Settlement Number:** 802

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine operational settlement affecting specific securities with relatively small quantities. The demat auction mechanism is used to complete failed delivery obligations from previous trading sessions.

**Operational Impact:** Low to Medium - Affects only those brokers and clearing members who have short delivery obligations in the listed scrips. The quantities involved are generally small except for a few securities.

**Investor Impact:** Minimal - Individual investors are not directly impacted unless their broker has failed to deliver securities. The auction mechanism ensures settlement completion and market integrity.

**Notable Securities:** While many prominent companies are listed (Reliance, ITC, ICICI Bank, Tata Steel, Havells, Trent, Page Industries), the quantities involved are very small, indicating minor delivery failures rather than systemic issues.
