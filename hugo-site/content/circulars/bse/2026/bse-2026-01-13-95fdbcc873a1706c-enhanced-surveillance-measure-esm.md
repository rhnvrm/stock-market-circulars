title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities List Update Effective January
  14, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective January 14, 2026. Three securities are being newly added to ESM: Bhakti Gems and Jewellery Ltd, Pro Clb Global Ltd, and Samtel India Ltd. Additionally, Maruti Interior Products Ltd (SME scrip) will be moved to a higher ESM stage. No securities are exiting the ESM framework or moving to lower stages. The circular also provides a consolidated list of all securities currently under ESM across different stages.

## Key Points

- 3 new securities added to Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework
- Bhakti Gems and Jewellery Ltd (Scrip Code: 540545, ISIN: INE986W01016)
- Pro Clb Global Ltd (Scrip Code: 540703, ISIN: INE438C01010)
- Samtel India Ltd (Scrip Code: 500371, ISIN: INE538C01017)
- Maruti Interior Products Ltd (Scrip Code: 543464, ISIN: INE0JSJ01014) moved to higher ESM stage
- No securities moving out of ESM framework
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages
- Consolidated list includes securities across ESM Stage I and Stage II

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework applies additional surveillance measures to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or other concerns. Securities under ESM are subject to:
- Trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday trading)
- 100% upfront margin requirements
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Price bands and other trading restrictions depending on ESM stage

Higher ESM stages impose progressively stricter trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ESM framework restrictions for affected securities
- Clients trading in ESM securities must provide full upfront margins
- Only delivery-based trading permitted (no intraday squaring off)
- Members must monitor and report any suspicious trading patterns
- Enhanced due diligence required for client orders in ESM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 14, 2026
- Changes to ESM framework including new additions and stage movements become effective from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of securities to ESM framework typically results in reduced liquidity and trading volumes for affected stocks due to stricter trading conditions. The trade-for-trade mechanism and 100% margin requirements discourage speculative trading.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will face:
- Mandatory delivery-based trading only
- Higher capital requirements (100% upfront margin)
- Potential difficulty in exiting positions due to reduced liquidity
- Increased price volatility due to lower trading volumes

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to:
- Update their risk management systems
- Communicate restrictions to clients
- Ensure proper margin collection before order placement
- Monitor compliance with ESM framework rules

The consolidated list provided helps market participants identify all securities currently under enhanced surveillance across different stages, enabling better risk assessment and trading decisions.
