## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine administrative listing of ESOP/ESOS securities affecting a relatively small number of shares (9,960 total). The lock-in provisions on 4,981 shares ensure controlled release into the market over the next year, while 4,979 shares are immediately tradable. No broader implications for market operations or trading activity.
