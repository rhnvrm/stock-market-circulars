title: Pre-Trade Risk Control – Enhancements for Stop Loss Limit Orders in Equity
  Derivatives Segment - Implementation Date Update
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the implementation timeline for pre-trade risk control enhancements for stop loss limit orders in the equity derivatives segment. Following market participant feedback on the earlier circular dated January 14, 2026 (circular no. 20260114-28), the enhancement will now go live on February 9, 2026, instead of the originally planned date. A mock trading session for testing will be available on February 7, 2026.

## Key Points

- Implementation date revised to Monday, February 9, 2026 based on market participant feedback
- Mock trading session scheduled for Saturday, February 7, 2026 for testing purposes
- This is a continuation of circular no. 20260114-28 dated January 14, 2026
- Trading members and third-party trading application vendors must complete necessary system development
- Enhancement applies to stop loss limit orders in equity derivatives segment

## Regulatory Changes

This circular does not introduce new regulatory changes but postpones the implementation of pre-trade risk control enhancements previously announced for stop loss limit orders in the equity derivatives segment.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must undertake necessary system development to accommodate the pre-trade risk control enhancements before February 9, 2026
- **Third-Party Trading Application Vendors**: Must update their systems to support the new risk control features
- **Testing Required**: All participants should utilize the mock trading session on February 7, 2026 to validate system readiness

## Important Dates

- **January 14, 2026**: Original circular no. 20260114-28 issued
- **January 16, 2026**: Updated implementation timeline announced (this circular)
- **February 7, 2026**: Mock trading session for testing
- **February 9, 2026**: Live implementation of enhancements

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: The timeline extension reduces implementation pressure on trading members and vendors, allowing additional time for system development and testing. This should result in smoother deployment with fewer technical issues.

**Market Impact**: Minimal immediate market impact as this is an administrative update. The actual enhancement will improve risk management for stop loss limit orders when implemented, potentially reducing order-level risks in equity derivatives trading.

**Stakeholder Impact**: Positive for trading members and technology vendors who requested more preparation time. The extended timeline demonstrates regulatory responsiveness to market feedback.
