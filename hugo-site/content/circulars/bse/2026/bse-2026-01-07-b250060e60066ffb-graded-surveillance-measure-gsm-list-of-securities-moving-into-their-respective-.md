## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of four securities into different stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. Three companies - Quadrant Televentures Ltd (511116), Worldwide Aluminium Ltd (526525), and ANS Industries Ltd (531406) - are moving to GSM Stage II. One company - Rajasthan Tube Manufacturing Company Ltd (530253) - is moving to the more restrictive GSM Stage III. The circular notes that securities may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM or IBC frameworks.

## Key Points

- Quadrant Televentures Ltd (Security Code: 511116, ISIN: INE527B01020) moved to GSM Stage II
- Worldwide Aluminium Ltd (Security Code: 526525, ISIN: INE550D01010) moved to GSM Stage II

- Securities marked (#) may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM Framework
- Securities marked ($) may move to lower GSM stages if included in IBC Framework

## Regulatory Changes

The movement to higher GSM stages imposes stricter surveillance measures on the affected securities. GSM is a graded framework where securities are placed in different stages based on various surveillance criteria. Higher stages (Stage II and III) typically involve additional trading restrictions such as:
- Trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday trading)
- Price bands restrictions
- Additional disclosures required
- Potential impact on margin requirements

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors and traders must be aware of the enhanced surveillance measures applicable to these securities
- Trading members should ensure compliance with trade-for-trade settlement requirements
- Enhanced due diligence required before trading in these securities
- Investors should review the specific restrictions applicable to each GSM stage
- Listed companies may need to provide additional disclosures or clarifications to facilitate removal from GSM

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: January 7, 2026
- Effective Date: The GSM stage changes are effective from the date of circular unless otherwise specified

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - Movement to higher GSM stages significantly reduces liquidity in affected securities as trade-for-trade requirements eliminate intraday trading opportunities and discourage speculative activity.

**Investor Impact:** High - Existing investors face reduced liquidity and potential difficulty in exiting positions. New investors face higher transaction costs and settlement obligations.

**Trading Impact:** Stricter surveillance measures may lead to reduced trading volumes and wider bid-ask spreads. The securities may see increased volatility due to reduced market participation.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and trading members must ensure their systems and processes accommodate the trade-for-trade settlement requirements and other restrictions associated with GSM securities.
