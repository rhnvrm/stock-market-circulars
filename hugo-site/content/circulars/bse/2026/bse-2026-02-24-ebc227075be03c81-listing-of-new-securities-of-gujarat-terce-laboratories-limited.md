- The entire allotment of 3,71,000 shares is subject to a lock-in period and cannot be freely traded until June 16, 2027

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 3,71,000 shares to the tradable universe of Gujarat Terce Laboratories Limited (Scrip Code: 524314), representing a promoter preferential allotment. However, since all newly listed shares are under lock-in until June 16, 2027, there is no immediate increase in free-float or liquidity. Market impact is minimal and confined to the company's existing shareholders and traders monitoring promoter shareholding changes.
