## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This circular is an informational notice regarding routine ESOP/ESOS share listings.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants are required to take note of the newly listed securities
- The listed shares are immediately available for trading on the Exchange
- Standard trading and settlement procedures apply to these securities

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: February 04, 2026
- **Listing Effective Date**: February 05, 2026 (Thursday)
- **Lock-in Period**: Not Applicable (NA) for all companies

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine administrative listing of ESOP/ESOS shares that represents standard employee compensation execution. The share quantities are relatively small compared to the outstanding equity base of these companies, resulting in minimal dilution.

**Trading Impact**: The shares are immediately available for trading without restrictions, providing liquidity to employee option holders who may choose to sell their vested shares.

**Company-Specific Impact**: 
- The dilution effect varies by company but is generally minimal
- ICICI Bank's 348,380 shares represent negligible dilution given its large capital base
- Smaller companies like Quick Heal (153 shares) and SBI Cards (8,096 shares) show minimal issuance
- No lock-in period indicates these are fully vested options exercised by employees

**Investor Considerations**: Investors should note the incremental share count increase for accurate valuation calculations, though the impact on per-share metrics is expected to be negligible.
