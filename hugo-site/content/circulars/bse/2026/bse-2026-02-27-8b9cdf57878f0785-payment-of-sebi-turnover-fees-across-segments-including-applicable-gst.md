This GST applicability has been in effect since July 18, 2022. Members are directed to ensure sufficient funds in their settlement/exchange dues accounts before the debit date.

## Key Points

- SEBI turnover fees are subject to 18% GST across all trading segments, effective July 18, 2022.
- Debit of turnover fees (including GST) will occur on **March 5, 2026** from the respective settlement (valan) account or Exchange dues account of trading members.
- Segment-wise turnover data and debit amounts will be available on **EXTRANET** (current date > EQ > Transaction) on or before **March 4, 2026**.
- GST at 18% is applicable on the amount in **column no. 26 of the TF2A file**.
- Invoices will be available on EXTRANET by **March 4, 2026**, under: Periodic files > 2026 > ZIP file named **SEBIFEB2026.Member_Code**.
- SEBI turnover fees and GST will be debited **separately** from the settlement account with appropriate narration.
- Relevant turnover files: TF2Ammyy, TF2Bmmyy, TF2Cmmyy, TF2Dmmyy, TF2Emmyy, TF2Fmmyy, TF2Gmmyy, TF2Hmmyy, TF2Immyy, and TF2Jmmyy (where mmyy = month and year).

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes are introduced. This notice reaffirms the existing GST applicability of 18% on SEBI turnover fees across all segments, as established since July 18, 2022. Members are referred to Exchange notice no. 20260130-2 for background details.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure **sufficient funds** are available in their settlement (valan) account or Exchange dues account before **March 5, 2026** to cover SEBI turnover fees plus 18% GST.
- Members should download their invoices from EXTRANET by March 4, 2026, using the path: Periodic files > 2026 > SEBIFEB2026.Member_Code.
- Members should verify their turnover figures and fee amounts via the TF2A–TF2J files available on EXTRANET on or before March 4, 2026.

## Important Dates

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| July 18, 2022 | GST at 18% on SEBI turnover fees effective |
| March 4, 2026 | Turnover data and invoices available on EXTRANET |
| March 5, 2026 | Debit of SEBI turnover fees + GST from settlement/Exchange dues accounts |

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine monthly compliance notice with moderate operational impact on all BSE trading members. Members active across multiple segments (Cash, F&O, Currency, Commodity, IRD, Debt, Repo, EGR) should ensure adequate liquidity in their settlement accounts well before March 5, 2026, to avoid any shortfall. No new fees or rates are being introduced; the 18% GST on SEBI turnover fees remains unchanged. Members should reconcile their segment-wise turnover data against the TF2 files on EXTRANET as a best practice before the debit date.
