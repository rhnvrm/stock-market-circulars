## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact:** High severity for affected shareholders who invested based on false promises of listing and dividends. Investors from Patel community specifically targeted and defrauded over 11+ year period with no returns.

**Company Impact:** Enforcement action against KKP Marketing India Limited and all 11 named individuals under multiple sections of SEBI Act. Potential for penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and criminal proceedings.

**Market Impact:** Limited direct market impact as company is unlisted. However, sets important precedent for SEBI enforcement against unlisted companies conducting irregular public issues and fraudulent practices.

**Regulatory Precedent:** Demonstrates SEBI's jurisdiction and willingness to act on complaints regarding unlisted companies engaging in public solicitation and fraud, protecting retail investors even in non-market contexts.
