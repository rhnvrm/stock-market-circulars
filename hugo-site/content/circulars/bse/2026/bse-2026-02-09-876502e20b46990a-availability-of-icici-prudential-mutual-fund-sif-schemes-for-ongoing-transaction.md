  StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

BSE announces the reopening of ICICI Prudential ISIF EQUITY EX-TOP 100 LONG-SHORT FUND and ISIF HYBRID LONG-SHORT FUND for ongoing transactions on the BSE StAR MF Platform effective February 10, 2026. The schemes will accept fresh/additional purchases, SIPs, redemptions, and switch transactions. Important restrictions apply to redemption and switch-out transactions with specific frequency limits for hybrid schemes.

## Key Points

- Four ICICI Prudential SIF schemes (both Regular and Direct plans) reopening for transactions
- ISIF EQUITY EX-TOP 100 LONG-SHORT FUND: Daily redemption and switch-out allowed
- ISIF HYBRID LONG-SHORT FUND: Redemption and switch-out limited to twice weekly (Monday and Wednesday)
- If Monday or Wednesday is non-business day, transactions processed on next working day
- Fresh/additional purchases and SIPs available for all schemes
- Redemption payout released per NAV applicability and scheme master TAT

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational update reversing previous suspension (Notice No. 20260114-22) of these schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must adhere to transaction frequency restrictions for ISIF HYBRID LONG-SHORT FUND schemes
- Redemption and switch-out transactions will be processed according to specified NAV applicability
- Payout TAT must follow scheme master specifications
- Members must note transaction frequency limitations when accepting client orders

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 10, 2026 - Schemes reopen for ongoing transactions
- **Transaction Days for Hybrid Schemes**: Monday and Wednesday each week (or next business day if holiday)

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Medium - Investors in these specialized SIF schemes regain ability to transact, though hybrid scheme investors face transaction frequency restrictions limiting liquidity to twice weekly.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - BSE StAR MF platform members must implement transaction frequency controls for hybrid schemes while allowing daily transactions for equity schemes.

**Market Impact**: Low - Affects specific SIF schemes only; no broader market implications. The transaction frequency restrictions are designed to manage fund liquidity appropriately for long-short strategies.
