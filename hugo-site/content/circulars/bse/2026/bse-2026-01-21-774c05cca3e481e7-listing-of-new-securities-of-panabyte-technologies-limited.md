- **Trading Commencement:** January 22, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing represents a modest expansion of Panabyte Technologies' equity capital base (approximately 11.95 lakh shares). The shares are subject to lock-in until July 31, 2026, which limits immediate trading liquidity. The preferential allotment to non-promoters at Rs. 19.75 per share provides capital to the company while the lock-in period ensures commitment from allottees. Market impact is expected to be minimal given the relatively small issue size and trading restrictions.
