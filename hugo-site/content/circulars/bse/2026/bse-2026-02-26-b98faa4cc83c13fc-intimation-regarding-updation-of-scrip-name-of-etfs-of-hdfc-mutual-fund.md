title: HDFC Mutual Fund ETF Scrip Name Updates Effective February 27, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has notified trading members of scrip name updates for three ETFs managed by HDFC Asset Management Company Limited. The name changes are administrative in nature, initiated by the AMC, and will be reflected in the BSE system from February 27, 2026. All other details — including scrip codes, ISINs, and trading symbols — remain unchanged.

## Key Points

- Three HDFC Mutual Fund ETFs are receiving updated scrip names effective February 27, 2026.
- Scrip codes, ISINs, and trading symbols are unaffected by these changes.
- The updates are based on instructions from HDFC Asset Management Company Limited.
- All other terms and conditions from prior notices on these ETFs remain unchanged.

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an administrative update to display names in the BSE system as directed by the fund house.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members should update their internal records and systems to reflect the new scrip names for the three affected ETFs:

| Scrip Code | ISIN | Symbol | Old Name | New Name |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 533230 | INF179KC1981 | HDFCGOLD | HDFC Gold Exchange Traded Fund | HDFC Gold ETF |
| 539517 | INF179KC1HX2 | HDFCSENSEX | HDFC S&P BSE SENSEX ETF | HDFC BSE SENSEX ETF |
| 543774 | INF179KC1EZ4 | HDFCBSE500 | HDFC S&P BSE 500 ETF | HDFC BSE 500 ETF |

## Important Dates

- **February 26, 2026** — Notice issued by BSE.
- **February 27, 2026** — Updated scrip names reflected in the BSE system.

## Impact Assessment

Impact is minimal. The changes are cosmetic renamings (primarily removing the 'S&P' branding from two ETF names and shortening the Gold ETF name) with no effect on ISINs, trading symbols, scrip codes, NAVs, or investor holdings. Trading members may need to update display labels in internal systems or client-facing platforms to avoid confusion.
