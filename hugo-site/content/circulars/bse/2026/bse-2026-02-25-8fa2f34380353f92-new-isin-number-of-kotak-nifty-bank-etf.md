title: New ISIN Number of KOTAK NIFTY BANK ETF Following Unit Split
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a follow-up to Exchange Notice No. 20260220-13 (dated February 20, 2026), informing trading members of the new ISIN assigned to KOTAK NIFTY BANK ETF (Scrip Code 590136) consequent to a change in face value of its units. The unit face value is being split from Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/-, and a new ISIN number INF174KA1ZB7 has been allotted, effective from the ex-date of February 27, 2026.

## Key Points

- New ISIN **INF174KA1ZB7** has been assigned to KOTAK NIFTY BANK ETF (Scrip Code: 590136)
- The change is due to a unit split: face value reduced from **Rs. 10/-** to **Re. 1/-** per unit
- This notice is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. **20260220-13** dated February 20, 2026
- The new ISIN is effective for trades done **on and from the ex-date: February 27, 2026**
- Reference: DR-830/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

The face value of KOTAK NIFTY BANK ETF units has been changed from Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/- per unit, necessitating the assignment of a new ISIN as per exchange regulations for corporate actions involving changes in face value.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to use the new ISIN **INF174KA1ZB7** for all trades in KOTAK NIFTY BANK ETF from February 27, 2026 onwards
- Members must ensure that orders, settlements, and back-office records reflect the new ISIN from the ex-date
- Investors and depository participants should note the ISIN change for holdings and transaction purposes

## Important Dates

- **February 20, 2026**: Original notice (20260220-13) issued announcing the face value change
- **February 25, 2026**: This circular issued with the new ISIN details
- **February 27, 2026**: Ex-date — new ISIN INF174KA1ZB7 becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

The unit split from Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/- increases the number of units held by existing investors proportionally, while keeping the total investment value unchanged. The new ISIN INF174KA1ZB7 must be used by trading members, brokers, and depository participants from February 27, 2026. Failure to update systems to the new ISIN may cause trade settlement issues. The change improves accessibility of the ETF by lowering the per-unit price, potentially attracting more retail participation in the KOTAK NIFTY BANK ETF.
