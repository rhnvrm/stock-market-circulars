## Regulatory Changes

The LT-ASM framework continues to apply enhanced surveillance measures to securities exhibiting certain characteristics warranting closer monitoring. Securities in this framework are subject to additional margin requirements and trading restrictions to protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with enhanced margin requirements for securities under LT-ASM
- Investors trading in LT-ASM securities should be aware of additional surveillance measures and potential trading restrictions

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 4 securities to the LT-ASM framework will subject them to enhanced surveillance and higher margin requirements, which may reduce liquidity and trading volumes in these stocks. Existing holders and potential investors should be aware of the increased regulatory scrutiny. The consolidated list shows securities distributed across multiple ASM stages, indicating varying levels of surveillance intensity based on individual security characteristics.
