## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine NFO launch that only affects mutual fund distributors and investors interested in long-short equity and hybrid strategies.

**Operational Impact**: Low to moderate for BSE StAR MF Platform members who will facilitate these NFO transactions. Members need to ensure compliance with specified timelines for fund transfers and registration authentication.

**Investor Impact**: Provides investment opportunities in specialized long-short strategies through both equity ex-top 100 and hybrid fund variants. Investors gain access to alternative investment strategies within the SIF framework.

**Segment**: Mutual Fund segment only, no impact on equity or derivatives markets.
