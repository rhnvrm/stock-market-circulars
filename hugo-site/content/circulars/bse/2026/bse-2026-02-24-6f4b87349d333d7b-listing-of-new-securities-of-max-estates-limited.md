## Important Dates

| Event | Date |

| Listing / Trading Commencement | February 25, 2026 |
| Lock-in Expiry | August 31, 2027 |

## Impact Assessment

The listing represents a modest dilution of the existing equity base of Max Estates Limited. Since all newly listed shares are held by promoters and subject to a lock-in until August 31, 2027, there is no immediate increase in free-float or selling pressure. Market impact is expected to be minimal in the short term. The preferential allotment at Rs. 657/- per share via warrant conversion indicates promoter confidence in the company at that price level.
