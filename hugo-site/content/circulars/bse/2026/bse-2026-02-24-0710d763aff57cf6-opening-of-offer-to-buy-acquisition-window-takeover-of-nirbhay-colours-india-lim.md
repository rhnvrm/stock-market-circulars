## Impact Assessment

This corrigendum has a **targeted impact** on shareholders of Nirbhay Colours India Limited who are eligible to participate in the open offer. The revision of the tendering period (now 16th February to 2nd March 2026) provides shareholders with updated timelines for tendering their equity shares. The broader market impact is minimal as this pertains to a single company's takeover offer. Shareholders who may have acted on the originally disclosed dates should note the amendments and plan their participation accordingly within the revised schedule.
