An 18% GST applies to these fees effective July 18, 2022, as previously communicated via Exchange Notice No. 20260130-2.

- GST at 18% is payable on the amount in column no. 26 of the TF2A file
- Invoices for February 2026 will be available in EXTRANET by **March 04, 2026**
- SEBI turnover fees will be debited separately from the settlement account with appropriate narration
- Members must ensure sufficient funds in their settlement (valan) or Exchange dues accounts

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes are introduced in this circular. This is a periodic notification reaffirming the existing framework under which 18% GST applies to SEBI turnover fees across all segments since July 18, 2022. Members are referred to Exchange Notice No. 20260130-2 for the original regulatory basis.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading members** must ensure adequate funds are available in their settlement (valan) account or Exchange dues account before March 05, 2026 to cover SEBI turnover fees plus 18% GST
- Members should download and review turnover files from EXTRANET (path: Current date > EQ > Transaction) by March 04, 2026
- Invoices must be downloaded from EXTRANET (path: Periodic files > 2026 > ZIP file named `SEBIFEB2026.Member_Code`) by March 04, 2026
- Relevant TF2 files to review: TF2Ammyy, TF2Bmmyy, TF2Cmmyy, TF2Dmmyy, TF2Emmyy, TF2Fmmyy, TF2Gmmyy, TF2Hmmyy, TF2Immyy, TF2Jmmyy (where `mmyy` = month and year)

## Important Dates

|------|-------|
| March 04, 2026 | Turnover details and invoices available on EXTRANET |
| March 05, 2026 | SEBI turnover fees + 18% GST debited from member accounts |

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine monthly operational notice affecting all BSE trading members across Cash, Derivatives, Currency Derivatives, Commodity Derivatives, Interest Rate Derivatives, New Debt, Repo, and EGR segments. The primary impact is on liquidity management — members must ensure sufficient funds in their settlement accounts before March 05, 2026. There is no change in fee structure or GST rate; the 18% GST on SEBI turnover fees has been in effect since July 18, 2022. The notice is particularly relevant for high-volume traders whose turnover fees may be substantial.
