## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies graded surveillance measures based on unusual price movements. Securities in this framework are subject to:
- Restricted price bands
- Enhanced margin requirements
- Trading restrictions to curb excessive speculation
- Stage-wise escalation if abnormal price movements continue

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable price bands for securities under ST-ASM
- Higher margin requirements apply to these securities
- Members should inform clients about the surveillance status of these securities
- Position limits and trading restrictions as per the ST-ASM framework must be adhered to

## Important Dates

- **January 9, 2026**: 10 securities exit ST-ASM Framework
- **January 12, 2026**: 8 new securities enter ST-ASM Framework; 1 security moves to lower stage

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The inclusion of securities in ST-ASM typically results in reduced liquidity and trading volumes due to enhanced restrictions. Price discovery may be affected by the restricted price bands.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will face:
- Limited intraday price movement due to tighter price bands
- Higher margin requirements increasing capital costs
- Potential exit of short-term traders, affecting liquidity

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members must update their systems to reflect the new surveillance categories and ensure proper risk management controls are in place for these securities.
