## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and investors must note that securities added to ST-ASM are subject to enhanced surveillance conditions including applicable margin requirements under the 5/15/30 Days ASM stages.
- Investors holding or trading in the newly shortlisted securities should review their positions in light of the applicable ASM stage restrictions.
- Brokers must ensure compliance with margin and trading conditions applicable to securities under ST-ASM from February 23, 2026.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 20, 2026
- **Effective Date for all changes:** February 23, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 8 securities to the ST-ASM framework implies increased scrutiny due to unusual price or volume movements. Affected stocks will face enhanced margin requirements and trading restrictions, which may reduce liquidity and increase trading costs for retail and institutional participants. The exit of 12 securities from ST-ASM (including one migrating to the stricter LT-ASM and one to ESM) signals ongoing regulatory monitoring. Overall market impact is limited and localized to the specific scrips involved.
