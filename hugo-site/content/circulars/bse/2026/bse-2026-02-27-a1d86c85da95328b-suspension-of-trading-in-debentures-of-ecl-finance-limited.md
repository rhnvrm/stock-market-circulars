## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Trading in this specific NCD series on BSE will be suspended from 02/03/2026. Investors holding these debentures will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms of the instrument. Secondary market liquidity for INE804I07O32 effectively ceases from the suspension date.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update order management and risk systems to prevent any inadvertent trades post-suspension. Settlement of any trades executed prior to the suspension date must be completed in the normal course.

**Investor Impact:** Debenture holders on record as of 02/03/2026 will be eligible for redemption at face/agreed value. No trading opportunity will exist on or after this date, so holders wishing to exit before redemption must do so prior to 02/03/2026.
