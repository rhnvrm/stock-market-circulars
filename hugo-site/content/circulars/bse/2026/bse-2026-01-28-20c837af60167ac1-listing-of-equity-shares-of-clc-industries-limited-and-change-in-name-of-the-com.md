## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Existing Shareholders**: The resolution plan resulted in dramatic restructuring with 100% promoter exit and 95% reduction in public shareholding (1 share for every 100 shares held). This significantly diluted existing public shareholders while bringing in a new Successful Resolution Applicant holding approximately 95% of post-restructuring equity.

**Trading Restrictions**: Continued placement in T Group with Trade-to-Trade segment indicates enhanced surveillance and potential liquidity constraints. Investors can only take delivery positions with no intraday trading allowed.

**Corporate Restructuring**: The company emerged from insolvency proceedings under IBC, indicating previous financial distress. New management and capital structure may present turnaround opportunities but also carry execution risks.

**Lock-in Period**: Significant portion (90%) of shares under lock-in until January 2027 will restrict supply and may impact price discovery and liquidity in the near term.
