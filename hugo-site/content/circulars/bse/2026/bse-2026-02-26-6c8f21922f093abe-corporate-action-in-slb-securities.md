## Summary

BSE has announced corporate actions for securities in the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) segment. Four securities are affected with actions including dividends, a stock split, and a rights issue, each carrying specific book closure/record dates and shut periods during which SLB transactions will be restricted.

## Key Points

- SBI Life Insurance Company Limited is paying a **Dividend** with a record date of 06-March-2026 and a shut period of 05-Mar-2026 to 06-Mar-2026.
- Angel One Limited is undergoing a **Stock Split** effective 26-February-2026 (ex-date today) with a shut period of 25-Feb-2026 to 26-Feb-2026.
- Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) is paying a **Dividend** with a record date of 13-March-2026 and a shut period of 12-Mar-2026 to 13-Mar-2026.
- HealthCare Global Enterprises Limited is conducting a **Rights Issue of Equity Shares** with a record date of 02-March-2026, foreclosure date of 02-Mar-2026, and a shut period of 27-Feb-2026 to 02-Mar-2026.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular is a standard operational notification under existing SLB framework rules governing corporate action handling in the lending and borrowing segment.

## Compliance Requirements

- SLB participants holding or lending positions in the four affected securities must close or settle positions before the respective shut periods commence.
- For HealthCare Global Enterprises Limited, participants must note the foreclosure date of 02-Mar-2026, by which all open SLB positions must be closed.
- Participants should reconcile their SLB positions against the announced shut periods to avoid forced settlements.

## Important Dates

| Security | Action | Ex/Record Date | Foreclosure Date | Shut Period |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd | Dividend | 06-Mar-2026 | — | 05-Mar-2026 to 06-Mar-2026 |
| Angel One Limited | Stock Split | 26-Feb-2026 | — | 25-Feb-2026 to 26-Feb-2026 |
| Indian Railway Finance Corporation | Dividend | 13-Mar-2026 | — | 12-Mar-2026 to 13-Mar-2026 |
| HealthCare Global Enterprises Ltd | Rights Issue | 02-Mar-2026 | 02-Mar-2026 | 27-Feb-2026 to 02-Mar-2026 |

## Impact Assessment

SLB participants with open positions in any of the four securities need to act promptly, particularly for **Angel One Limited** (shut period already in effect as of today, 26-Feb-2026) and **HealthCare Global Enterprises Limited** (shut period begins 27-Feb-2026, tomorrow). The rights issue for HCG carries additional complexity due to the foreclosure requirement. Dividend-related actions for SBILIFE and IRFC provide more lead time. Overall market impact is moderate and contained to SLB desk operations.
