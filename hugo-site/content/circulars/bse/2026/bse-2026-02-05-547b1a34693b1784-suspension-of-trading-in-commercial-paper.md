## Impact Assessment

This notice has medium impact on the debt market segment. The suspension affects 22 commercial paper instruments across major corporate groups including Adani Enterprises, Bajaj group companies, Reliance Retail Ventures, and financial services entities. While routine in nature, the simultaneous redemption of multiple commercial papers may temporarily affect short-term debt market liquidity. Trading members holding these instruments should ensure timely settlement for redemption. The notice does not impact equity trading or other debt instruments.
