**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction involves 117 securities with varied quantities. While most quantities are relatively small, some scrips have substantial volumes (WELCURE DRUG with 613,972 shares, EVEXIA LIFEC with 34,729 shares) that could experience temporary price volatility during the auction process.

**Operational Impact:** This is a routine settlement mechanism. Members with failed deliveries must ensure participation and settlement. The wide range of securities involved indicates dispersed settlement issues rather than concentrated problems in specific sectors.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders of the affected securities may experience temporary price movements during the auction. The mechanism ensures market integrity by forcing completion of failed settlements.
