## Summary

BSE has announced updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective February 05, 2026. The circular includes three key categories of changes: 7 securities are being newly shortlisted in the ST-ASM framework, 1 security (Antelopus Selan Energy Ltd) is moving to a lower stage within the framework, and 8 securities are exiting the ST-ASM framework. The ST-ASM framework is designed to monitor securities that exhibit unusual price movements or volatility patterns.

## Key Points

- 7 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework from February 05, 2026
- 1 security (Antelopus Selan Energy Ltd) moving to lower stage ASM, indicating reduced surveillance concern
- 8 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework entirely
- No securities moving to higher stage ASM in this update
- Framework includes both mainboard and SME scrips (marked with @ symbol)
- Some securities marked with * indicate alignment with NSE surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies staged surveillance measures (5/15/30 days) to securities exhibiting unusual price or volume patterns. Securities in this framework face enhanced monitoring and may have trading restrictions. The framework operates in stages, with securities potentially moving to higher or lower stages based on market behavior.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note the enhanced surveillance status of newly added securities
- Trading members must ensure compliance with any additional margin requirements or trading restrictions applicable to ST-ASM securities
- Investors should be aware that securities under ST-ASM may have restricted trading conditions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 05, 2026 - All changes to ST-ASM framework come into effect

## Impact Assessment

**Securities Being Added to ST-ASM**: Abate As Industries Ltd, Apar Industries Ltd, Avalon Technologies Ltd, Kabsons Industries Ltd, Purple Entertainment Ltd, Rnit Ai Solutions Ltd, and Shiv Texchem Ltd will face enhanced surveillance, which may impact liquidity and trading activity.

**Securities Exiting ST-ASM**: Dr Lalchandani Labs Ltd, Indo Cotspin Ltd, Lotus Chocolate Company Ltd, Mercury Ev-Tech Ltd, Onesource Specialty Pharma Ltd, RLF Ltd, Shipwaves Online Limited, and Zenith Steel Pipes & Industries Ltd are being removed from surveillance, potentially improving trading conditions.

**Lower Stage Movement**: Antelopus Selan Energy Ltd moving to lower stage indicates improved market behavior and reduced surveillance concern.

The circular also includes a consolidated list showing current ST-ASM Stage I securities, providing transparency for market participants.
