title: Revision in Eligibility Criteria for Direct Listing on BSE Main Board
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the eligibility criteria applicable to SME companies seeking migration to the Main Board and to companies listed on other recognized stock exchanges seeking direct listing on the BSE Main Board. The criteria cover minimum paid-up capital, market capitalisation, market liquidity, operating profitability, networth, net tangible assets, promoter holding, and lock-in requirements.

## Key Points

- Minimum paid-up capital requirement: Rs. 10 crores
- Direct listing market cap threshold: Rs. 1,000 crores (6-month average); SME migration threshold: Rs. 100 crores
- Market capitalisation criterion can be substituted if revenue from operations is Rs. 100 crores or more for each of the preceding 3 full financial years
- Market liquidity requires trading on at least 80% of days during the prior 6-month period
- Average Operating Profit (EBITDA) of Rs. 15 crores on a restated consolidated basis over the preceding 3 years, with a minimum of Rs. 10 crores in each year
- Minimum networth of Rs. 1 crore in each of the preceding 3 full financial years
- Net tangible assets of at least Rs. 3 crores in each of the preceding 3 full years, with not more than 50% held in monetary assets
- Minimum promoter holding of at least 20% at the time of application
- Promoter/promoter group shares subject to a 6-month lock-in from the date of BSE listing

## Regulatory Changes

BSE has updated the eligibility framework for Main Board listing with the following key revisions:

- **Market Capitalisation**: Direct listing threshold set at Rs. 1,000 crores; SME migration at Rs. 100 crores, both calculated as a 6-month average
- **Revenue Alternative**: Companies with revenue from operations of Rs. 100 crores or more for each of the preceding 3 full financial years may satisfy both the market capitalisation and market liquidity criteria alternatively
- **Market Liquidity**: Minimum 5% of weighted average listed equity shares must have been traded in the 6-month period; trading on at least 80% of trading days; minimum average daily turnover of Rs. 10 lakhs (minimum daily: Rs. 5 lakhs); minimum average 50 daily trades (minimum daily: 25 trades)
- **Name Change Rule**: If the company changed its name within the last year, at least 50% of revenue must be earned from activities reflected by the new name
- **Lock-in Exemption**: Lock-in requirement does not apply to companies already listed on a recognized exchange with nationwide trading terminals meeting all other criteria
- **Promoter Holding Exemption**: Minimum promoter holding criterion not applicable for diversified holdings or where there are no identifiable promoters, if the company is already listed on a recognized exchange with nationwide trading terminals

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies applying for direct listing or SME migration to BSE Main Board must meet all specified financial thresholds (paid-up capital, market cap or revenue alternative, EBITDA, networth, net tangible assets)
- Applicant companies must demonstrate market liquidity metrics over the preceding 6-month period or satisfy the revenue alternative criterion
- Promoters must hold at least 20% at the time of application; promoter group shareholding may be counted toward this requirement
- Promoter and promoter group shares are subject to a 6-month lock-in post-listing unless exempted
- Companies that changed their name within the last year must ensure at least 50% of revenue is attributable to the new business activity
- Monetary assets must not exceed 50% of net tangible assets, unless the company has firm commitments to deploy the excess in its business or project

## Important Dates

- Circular date: 23 February 2026
- Effective date: Not explicitly stated; applicants should treat these as current applicable criteria

## Impact Assessment

This circular has high impact on companies listed on regional or smaller recognized exchanges considering a migration or direct listing to BSE's Main Board, as well as SME-listed companies seeking to upgrade. The revised thresholds — particularly the Rs. 1,000 crore market cap requirement for direct listing and the EBITDA floor — set a high bar that filters out smaller or less liquid companies. The revenue-based alternative provides a practical pathway for operationally strong companies that may not meet market cap or liquidity thresholds. The lock-in and promoter holding exemptions for companies already listed on exchanges with nationwide terminals reduce regulatory burden for eligible applicants. Overall, the circular tightens governance and financial quality standards for Main Board entrants, which may improve investor confidence but restrict the number of eligible applicants.
