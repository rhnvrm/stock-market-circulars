  Mode'

## Summary

BSE has issued an important advisory to Mutual Fund Intermediaries (MFIs), Mutual Fund Distributors (MFDs), and Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) regarding an upcoming change in UPI payment processing. Payment aggregators have indicated that the UPI Collect flow (Pay via UPI ID/Number) for one-time UPI payments may be discontinued in the near future. To ensure uninterrupted payment processing, members must enable/integrate UPI Intent/QR mode with their respective payment aggregators immediately.

## Key Points
