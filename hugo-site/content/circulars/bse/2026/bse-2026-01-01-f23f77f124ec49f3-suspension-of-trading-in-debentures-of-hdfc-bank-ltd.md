- Purpose: Redemption on Exercise of Put Option and Payment of Interest
- Notice Reference: DR-795/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of this specific HDFC Bank debenture series. The suspension is procedural and temporary, affecting only the debt segment. Investors holding these debentures who wish to exercise the put option will benefit from the redemption, while those wanting to trade will be unable to do so from January 9, 2026.
