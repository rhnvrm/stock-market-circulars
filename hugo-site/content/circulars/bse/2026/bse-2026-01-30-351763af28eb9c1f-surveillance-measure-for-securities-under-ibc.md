title: Surveillance Measure for Securities under IBC
---

## Summary

BSE has issued surveillance measures for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) framework effective February 01, 2026. String Metaverse Ltd has been shortlisted in Stage 1 Additional Surveillance Measure. Ten securities are moving to Stage 0 (Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure), and Ujaas Energy Ltd is being excluded from ASM framework. The circular provides comprehensive annexures listing all affected securities across different IBC stages.

## Key Points

- String Metaverse Ltd (Scrip Code: 534535, ISIN: INE958L01026) shortlisted in Stage 1 ASM under IBC framework
- 10 securities moving to Stage 0 (corporate announcement receipt stage) from previous surveillance stages
- Ujaas Energy Ltd (Scrip Code: 533644) being excluded from ASM for IBC framework
- No securities moving from Stage I to Stage II or vice versa
- Consolidated list includes multiple securities at various IBC stages including recommencement scrips marked with ^
- T+0 scrips shortlisted based on parent company marked with ~
- Framework aligned with NSE surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

The surveillance framework for IBC-related securities continues with stage-based monitoring:

**Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from company regarding insolvency proceedings

**Stage 1**: Additional Surveillance Measure for companies in Insolvency Resolution Process under IBC

**Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance for companies with prolonged insolvency proceedings

Securities can move between stages based on developments in insolvency proceedings or be excluded upon resolution.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note surveillance stage classifications for affected securities
- Enhanced due diligence required for securities under IBC surveillance framework
- Investors should be informed about surveillance status of these securities
- Price bands and trading restrictions may apply based on surveillance stage
- Compliance with disclosure requirements for securities under IBC proceedings

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 01, 2026 - All surveillance measure changes take effect
- **Circular Issue Date**: January 30, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: String Metaverse Ltd entering Stage 1 ASM will face additional surveillance measures including potential trading restrictions, price bands, or enhanced disclosure requirements. The 10 securities moving to Stage 0 indicate new or updated insolvency disclosures requiring heightened investor awareness.

**Market Impact**: Securities under IBC surveillance typically experience increased volatility and reduced liquidity. Investors holding these securities may face challenges in position unwinding due to trading restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: High impact for shareholders of affected companies, particularly String Metaverse Ltd entering enhanced surveillance. Securities moving to Stage 0 provide early warning for investors to reassess risk exposure.

**Positive Development**: Ujaas Energy Ltd exclusion from ASM framework indicates resolution or improvement in insolvency status, potentially restoring normal trading conditions.
