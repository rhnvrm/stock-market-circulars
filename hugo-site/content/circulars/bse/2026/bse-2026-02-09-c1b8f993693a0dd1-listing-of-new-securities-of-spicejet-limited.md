## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Moderate dilution impact as substantial number of shares added to equity base through loan conversion. The preferential allotment to non-promoters indicates capital restructuring, likely to improve SpiceJet's debt position. Lock-in until August 2026 provides temporary price stability by restricting immediate selling pressure.

**Operational Impact**: Debt-to-equity conversion improves balance sheet metrics and reduces interest burden. Non-promoter participation suggests confidence from financial or strategic investors. The premium pricing (Rs. 42.32) indicates perceived value above face value despite financial challenges historically faced by the company.
