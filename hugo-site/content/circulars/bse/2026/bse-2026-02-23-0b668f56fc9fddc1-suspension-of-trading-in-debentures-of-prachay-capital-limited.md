title: Suspension of Trading in Debentures of Prachay Capital Limited
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a suspension notice (Notice No. 20260223-42) directing all trading members to refrain from dealing in the Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of Prachay Capital Limited. The suspension is in connection with the company's fixed record date of March 4, 2026, for Redemption on Exercise of PUT Option and Payment of Interest on the specified debenture.

## Key Points

- Trading in Prachay Capital Limited's NCD (scrip code 976848, ISIN INE0IID07694) is suspended effective March 4, 2026
- The debenture series is PCL-14%-19-9-29-UL-PVT, a privately placed instrument
- Record date is fixed at April 3, 2026 for dual purposes: PUT Option redemption and interest payment
- Notice reference: DR-832/2025-2026
- Issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance And Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This is a standard operational directive under BSE's existing debt market suspension procedures triggered by a corporate action (PUT Option exercise and interest payment).

## Compliance Requirements

- All trading members must cease dealings in Prachay Capital Limited NCD (ISIN: INE0IID07694, Code: 976848) from March 4, 2026
- Members must update their systems to block or flag this security from the no-dealings date
- Non-compliance with trading suspension directives constitutes a regulatory violation

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 23, 2026
- **Record Date / No-Dealings From:** March 4, 2026
- **Purpose on Record Date:** Redemption on Exercise of PUT Option + Payment of Interest

## Impact Assessment

The suspension affects only a single privately placed NCD series of Prachay Capital Limited, limiting broader market impact. Trading members active in the debt segment must ensure their systems enforce the no-dealings restriction from March 4, 2026. Investors holding this debenture should note that liquidity on the exchange will cease from that date, with the PUT Option redemption providing an exit mechanism.
