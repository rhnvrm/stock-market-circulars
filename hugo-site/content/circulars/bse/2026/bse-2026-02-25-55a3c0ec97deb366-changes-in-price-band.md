## Impact Assessment

These revisions constrain the permissible intraday price movement for the 17 affected scrips. Scrips assigned tighter bands (2%) face significant curbs on volatility, typically indicating heightened surveillance concern. The 20% band assigned to AVI Polymers, Onelife Capital Advisors, and Suryo Foods & Industries represents a relatively liberal limit, possibly reflecting a relaxation from a prior tighter band. Trading members and investors holding positions in these scrips should note the revised limits to avoid order rejections. The changes are a standard BSE surveillance tool and do not indicate any fundamental corporate event.
