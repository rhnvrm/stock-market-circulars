## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

Impact is minimal and routine. The suspension affects only two specific T-Bill instruments in the debt segment, which are maturing as per their scheduled redemption dates. This is a standard lifecycle event for government treasury bills and does not indicate any adverse market development. Debt market participants holding these instruments should prepare for settlement on the redemption date.
