**Market Impact**: The listing of approximately 51.5 crore new shares represents a substantial increase in the equity base of Allcargo Logistics Limited. This corporate restructuring through the composite scheme of arrangement consolidates five entities and will result in increased free float and potentially enhanced liquidity in the scrip.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will experience dilution as the equity base expands significantly. However, the new shares being issued pursuant to a composite scheme suggests this is part of a strategic corporate reorganization aimed at simplifying the group structure.

**Operational Impact**: The scheme involves integration of supply chain and logistics entities (Allcargo Supply Chain, Gati Express and Supply Chain, Allcargo Gati, and Allcargo ECU) which may create operational synergies and streamlined business operations under the parent company.
