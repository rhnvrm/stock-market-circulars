title: BSE Promoter & Non-Promoter Encumbrance Surveillance Measure Update - March
  2026
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the list of securities under the surveillance measure applicable to companies with high Promoter as well as non-Promoter encumbrance, pursuant to Regulation 28(3) of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011. The changes are effective from **March 02, 2026**. No new securities have been added to the framework in this review cycle, while three securities are being removed.

## Key Points

- **No new additions**: Annexure I (new entrants) is Nil — no securities are being newly placed under this encumbrance surveillance measure.
- **Three securities exiting**: Forbes Precision Tools and Machine Parts Ltd, Future Market Networks Ltd, and Setco Automotive Ltd are moving out of the framework effective March 02, 2026.
- **Ten securities remain**: The consolidated list (Annexure III) retains 10 securities under this surveillance measure.
- Note markers indicate some exits may be due to migration into LT ASM, ESM, or TT frameworks.

## Regulatory Changes

This circular is issued under Regulation 28(3) of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, which mandates surveillance actions for listed companies where promoter or non-promoter shareholding encumbrance crosses prescribed thresholds. The update reflects the latest periodic review of the encumbrance framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and market participants should note the revised list and update their internal compliance systems.
- Securities moving out may be subject to different surveillance frameworks (LT ASM, ESM, or TT) as indicated by the note markers in Annexure II.
- Investors and brokers dealing in the 10 retained securities must continue to adhere to applicable restrictions under this encumbrance measure.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: March 02, 2026
- **Circular Date**: February 27, 2026
