## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine listing notification for newly allotted securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to permit trading of these new securities from February 26, 2026
- The 24,000 shares are subject to a lock-in period and cannot be traded until August 30, 2026

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

The listing involves a very small tranche of 24,000 shares relative to the company's total equity, resulting in minimal dilution impact. Since these shares are subject to lock-in until August 30, 2026, there is no immediate increase in free-float or tradeable supply. Market impact is expected to be negligible.
