title: Periodic Call Auction for Illiquid Scrips - 51 Securities Added
---

## Summary

BSE has shortlisted 51 securities for trading under the periodic call auction mechanism effective January 09, 2026. These securities have been identified as illiquid scrips and will no longer be available for continuous trading. The periodic call auction provides a structured trading window for securities with low trading volumes.

## Key Points

- 51 securities will move to periodic call auction mechanism
- Effective date: January 09, 2026
- Applies to illiquid scrips across various sectors
- Securities include companies like Abhinav Leasing & Finance Ltd, Abhishek Infraventures Ltd, Aditya Ispat Ltd, and others
- Complete list includes scrip codes, names, and ISIN numbers for identification

## Regulatory Changes

Securities listed in Annexure I will transition from continuous trading to periodic call auction mechanism. This is a market surveillance measure applied to securities demonstrating insufficient liquidity in normal trading sessions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must route orders for these securities through the periodic call auction session
- Investors should be aware of limited trading windows for these securities
- Market participants must use scrip codes and ISIN provided for accurate identification
- Normal continuous trading will not be available for these securities from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Announcement Date:** January 06, 2026
- **Effective Date:** January 09, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Investors holding or trading these 51 securities will experience restricted trading windows through periodic call auctions only. This may reduce liquidity further and impact price discovery.

**Market Participants:** Brokers and trading members need to adjust their systems and inform clients about the change in trading mechanism for affected securities.

**Investor Impact:** Medium impact for shareholders of affected companies. While trading remains possible through periodic auctions, reduced flexibility may affect ability to enter/exit positions quickly. Price volatility during auction sessions may increase.
