## Summary

BSE has listed 750,000 new equity shares of Shri Gang Industries & Allied Products Limited (Scrip Code: 523309, ISIN: INE241V01018) issued to promoters on a preferential basis. The shares are permitted to trade on the Exchange effective Tuesday, February 24, 2026, and rank pari-passu with existing equity shares.

## Key Points

- 750,000 equity shares of face value Rs. 10/- each issued at a premium of Rs. 89/-, totalling an issue price of Rs. 99/- per share.
- Shares allotted to Promoters on a preferential basis.
- New shares are pari-passu with the existing equity shares of the company.
- Distribution Numbers: 18280001 to 19030000.
- ISIN: INE241V01018.

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notice pursuant to a completed preferential allotment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities and must update their systems to reflect the listing effective February 24, 2026.
- The allotted shares carry a mandatory lock-in and cannot be traded until the lock-in expiry date.

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** November 13, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date:** February 24, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry Date:** September 30, 2027 (applicable to all 750,000 shares, Dist. Nos. 18280001 to 19030000)

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 750,000 shares to the tradeable equity of Shri Gang Industries & Allied Products Limited; however, all newly listed shares are subject to a lock-in until September 30, 2027, meaning they will not be available for trading in the near term. Market impact is therefore minimal. The preferential allotment to promoters at Rs. 99/- per share (Rs. 10 face value + Rs. 89 premium) reflects the valuation agreed at the time of allotment in November 2025.
