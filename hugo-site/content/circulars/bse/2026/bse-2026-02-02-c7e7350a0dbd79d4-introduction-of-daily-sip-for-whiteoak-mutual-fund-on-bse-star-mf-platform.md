## Regulatory Changes

This is a product enhancement rather than a regulatory change. WhiteOak Capital Asset Management Limited has exercised its discretion to expand SIP frequency options for investors.

## Compliance Requirements

- Unit allotment subject to credit realization in the scheme
- Multiple SIP installments realized on same day will be processed at applicable NAV as per Scheme Information Document (SID)
- This addendum forms integral part of Statement of Additional Information (SAI) and SIDs

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 01, 2026
- **Notice Date**: January 22, 2026
- **SIP Frequency**: All business days from Monday to Friday

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is an operational enhancement specific to WhiteOak Capital Mutual Fund investors.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for retail investors seeking higher frequency investment options. Provides flexibility for daily wage earners or those preferring micro-investments.

**Operational Impact**: 
- Enhances investment accessibility with lower entry barriers (Rs. 100 minimum)
- Aligns with trend toward democratization of mutual fund investments
- May increase transaction volumes on BSE StAR MF platform
- Restrictions on Pause/Modify features for daily SIPs may limit flexibility for some investors

**Risk Considerations**: 
- Automatic discontinuation after 3 consecutive failed installments requires adequate fund management
- Daily frequency may lead to higher transaction monitoring requirements for investors
