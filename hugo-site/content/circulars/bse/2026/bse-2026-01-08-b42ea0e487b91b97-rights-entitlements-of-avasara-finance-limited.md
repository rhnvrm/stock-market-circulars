Trading will be conducted on a T+1 rolling settlement basis in dematerialized form only.

- Scrip Code: 751075, Scrip ID: AVASA-RE
- ISIN: INE759D20017
- Market Lot: 1, Group: R
- Settlement on T+1 rolling basis, trade-for-trade
- Trading in dematerialized form only
- Unsubscribed/unrenounced REs will lapse after Issue Closing Date

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements existing framework for Rights Entitlements trading as per previous notices (20200305-21 dated March 05, 2020 and 20200518-34 dated May 18, 2020).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must inform all clients about commencement of REs trading
- Must clearly mention the ISIN of the RE to clients
- Must include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases stating:
  - Purchase only gives right to participate in Rights Issue or renounce
  - REs must be subscribed with requisite application money or renounced before Issue Closing Date
  - Unsubscribed/unrenounced REs will lapse and be extinguished after Issue Closing Date
- Must ensure clients understand REs are not ordinary shares

## Important Dates

- **January 09, 2026**: Rights Entitlements trading commences; Rights Issue opens
- **January 14, 2026**: Last day for REs trading/renunciation
- **January 19, 2026**: Rights Issue closes; deadline for subscription or renunciation
- **Settlement**: T+1 rolling settlement basis

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to existing shareholders of AVASARA FINANCE LIMITED and investors interested in participating in the Rights Issue. The short trading window (6 days) for renunciation requires prompt action from shareholders.

**Operational Impact**: Trading Members must ensure proper communication to clients, implement disclaimer requirements in contract notes, and manage trade-for-trade settlement for REs. The dematerialized-only requirement streamlines settlement but requires proper demat infrastructure.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders must decide within the trading window whether to subscribe, renounce for value, or allow REs to lapse. Failure to act by January 19, 2026 will result in loss of rights.
