## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Positive for liquidity and trading activity. The shift from Trade for Trade to Rolling settlement allows for intraday trading, short selling (where permitted), and margin trading facilities, significantly improving market depth and investor participation.

The change from T2T (where each trade requires full upfront payment/delivery) to rolling settlement will enable more flexible trading strategies and improve capital efficiency for market participants.
