## Impact Assessment

The listing adds approximately 20.28 lakh new equity shares to the tradeable universe of Ratnaveer Precision Engineering Limited, representing a dilution to existing shareholders. However, since all newly listed shares are locked in until September 30, 2027, there is no immediate increase in free-float or selling pressure from promoters. Market impact in the short term is expected to be minimal. Investors should note the enhanced promoter stake and the eventual lock-in expiry date when assessing future supply dynamics.
