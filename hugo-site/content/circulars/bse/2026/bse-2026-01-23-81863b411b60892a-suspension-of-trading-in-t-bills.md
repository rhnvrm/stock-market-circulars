## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in three Treasury Bills effective January 27, 2026, as they are scheduled to mature on January 29, 2026. Trading members are advised not to deal in these securities from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Three T-Bills will be suspended from trading effective January 27, 2026
- Suspension reason: Securities maturing on redemption date (January 29, 2026)
- Scrip codes affected: 805098, 805021, 805136
- Circular reference: DR-806/2025-2026
- Notice issued by Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance & Operations

## Securities Affected

| Scrip Code | ISIN | Particulars |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 805098 | IN002025Y180 | 182TB29126 |
| 805021 | IN002024Z420 | 364TB29126 |
| 805136 | IN002025X315 | 91TB290126 |

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal with the three listed T-Bills from January 27, 2026 onwards
- Members should update their trading systems to reflect the suspension
- Ensure no new trades are executed in these securities post-suspension date

## Important Dates

- **January 23, 2026**: Circular issued
- **January 27, 2026**: Trading suspension effective date
- **January 29, 2026**: Redemption/maturity date for all three T-Bills

## Impact Assessment

Limited impact as this is a standard administrative action for maturing government securities. Debt market participants holding or trading these specific T-Bills need to plan for redemption. No broader market implications expected as this follows normal maturity procedures for Treasury Bills.
