The Board of Directors of both TRUST Asset Management and TRUST AMC Trustee have approved this merger, which has received SEBI's "No Objection" dated December 26, 2025. Unitholders are provided a 30-day exit window from January 12, 2026 to February 10, 2026 without any exit load.

## Key Points

- Any investments made during exit window will also be merged

**For Unitholders of Surviving Scheme (Corporate Bond Fund):**
