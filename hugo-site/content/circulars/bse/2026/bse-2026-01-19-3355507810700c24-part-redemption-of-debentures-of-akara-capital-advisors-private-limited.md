- Trading in the affected debentures will be conducted with reduced face value of Rs. 86,362 per debenture effective from January 30, 2026
- Settlement number DR-809/2025-2026 applies to the reduced face value trading

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: February 1, 2026 - For determining debenture holders eligible for part redemption and interest payment

The part redemption reduces the outstanding principal amount, and subsequent trading will reflect the reduced face value. No broader market implications are expected.
