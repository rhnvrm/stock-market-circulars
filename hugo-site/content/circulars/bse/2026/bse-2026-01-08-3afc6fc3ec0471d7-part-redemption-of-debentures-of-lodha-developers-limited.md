## Impact Assessment

This part redemption will reduce the outstanding face value of three debenture series issued by LODHA DEVELOPERS LIMITED. Debenture holders will receive partial repayment, reducing their exposure to the issuer. The market impact is limited to holders of these specific privately placed debentures. Liquidity in these securities may be affected post-redemption due to lower outstanding amounts. Trading members dealing in these securities need to update their systems to reflect the reduced face values to avoid settlement issues.
