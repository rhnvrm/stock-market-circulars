## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Approximately 85.3% of total shares (49.33 crore out of 57.81 crore) are either currently under lock-in or have exemptions, limiting immediate free float. The staggered lock-in expiry dates (February 2026, April 2026, July 2026, and July 2027) will gradually increase tradable shares. The significant promoter lock-in (37.68 crore shares total) provides stability and demonstrates long-term commitment.

**Tradability**: Immediately tradable shares include 8.47 crore IPO public shares, 2.07 crore ESOP shares, and 2.66 crore AIF shares, totaling approximately 13.20 crore shares (22.8% of total equity). This will increase progressively as anchor investor and promoter lock-ins expire.

**Investor Considerations**: The structured lock-in schedule is standard for newly listed companies and protects against immediate large-scale selling. ESOP and AIF exemptions provide some liquidity while anchor investor lock-ins are relatively short-term (30-90 days).
