## Summary

BSE has announced the commencement of trading in Rights Entitlements (REs) for renunciation of SICAL LOGISTICS LIMITED effective Thursday, February 26, 2026. The REs will trade under scrip code 751089 (Scrip ID: SICAL-RE) on a T+1 rolling settlement, trade-for-trade basis in dematerialized form only.

## Key Points

- Trading in Rights Entitlements (REs) for renunciation permitted from February 26, 2026 to March 5, 2026
- Scrip Code: 751089 | Scrip ID: SICAL-RE | ISIN: INE075B20012
- Market Lot: 1 | Group: R
- Settlement on T+1 Rolling Settlement basis; trades settled on trade-for-trade basis
- REs are tradable in dematerialized form only
- REs that are neither subscribed nor renounced by the Issue Closing Date (March 10, 2026) will lapse and be extinguished
- Trading members must inform clients that REs are not ordinary shares of the company
- Contract notes/bills must include a prominent disclaimer clarifying that purchase of REs only grants the right to participate in the rights issue or renounce before issue closure

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This notice follows existing framework established under:
- Notice No. 20200305-21 dated March 05, 2020
- Notice No. 20200518-34 dated May 18, 2020

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must notify all clients about the commencement of RE trading, specifying ISIN INE075B20012
- Trading members must clearly communicate that REs are distinct from ordinary shares
- Contract notes and bills for RE purchases must prominently display a disclaimer explaining the nature of REs and consequences of non-action
- All RE trades must be executed and settled in dematerialized form only
- Members must ensure clients are aware that unsubscribed and unrenounced REs will lapse after the issue closing date

## Important Dates

- **February 26, 2026**: Rights Issue opens; RE trading commences
- **March 5, 2026**: Last date for trading in Rights Entitlements (RE trading period closes)
- **March 10, 2026**: Rights Issue closes; deadline for subscription or renunciation of REs
- REs not acted upon by March 10, 2026 will be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a moderate, targeted impact relevant primarily to existing shareholders of SICAL LOGISTICS LIMITED and trading members facilitating transactions. Eligible shareholders can renounce their REs on the exchange between February 26 and March 5, 2026, providing a liquidity window. The trade-for-trade settlement and T+1 basis reduce counterparty risk but limit speculative activity. Trading members face compliance obligations around client disclosure and contract note disclaimers. REs that lapse post-March 10 represent a risk to shareholders who neither subscribe nor renounce in time.
