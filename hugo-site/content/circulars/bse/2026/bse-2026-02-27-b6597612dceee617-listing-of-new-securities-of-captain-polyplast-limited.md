## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine listing notification pursuant to a completed preferential allotment.

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 2,50,000 equity shares to the tradeable float of Captain Polyplast Limited, though the entire allotment is under lock-in until September 15, 2026, meaning no immediate increase in free-float liquidity. Market impact is minimal given the small size of the issuance and the lock-in period. This is a standard corporate action with no broader market or systemic implications.
