## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this is a routine auction settlement process. The quantities involved are relatively small for most scrips, suggesting minimal delivery failures. Large-cap stocks have very small quantities (1-50 shares), indicating good delivery compliance. Only a few mid/small-cap stocks have larger quantities (1,000+ shares), which may see temporary price pressure during auction settlement. Overall, this is a standard operational activity with no significant market-wide implications.
