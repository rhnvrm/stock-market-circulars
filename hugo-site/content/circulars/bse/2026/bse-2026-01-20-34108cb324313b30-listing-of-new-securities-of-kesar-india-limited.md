## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. This is a routine listing of preferentially allotted shares following warrant conversion. The lock-in periods (ranging from 6 months to 18 months) will prevent immediate trading of these shares, minimizing short-term supply pressure.

**Dilution:** The new shares represent additional equity capital for Kesar India Limited. Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect, though the preferential issue to promoters may also strengthen promoter holding.

**Liquidity:** No immediate impact on liquidity as all shares are subject to lock-in periods. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital.
