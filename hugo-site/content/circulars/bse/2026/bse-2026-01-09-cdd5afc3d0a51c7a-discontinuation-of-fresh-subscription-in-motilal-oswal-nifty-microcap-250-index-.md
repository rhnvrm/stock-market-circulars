title: Discontinuation of Fresh Subscription in Motilal Oswal Nifty Microcap 250 Index
  Fund
---

## Summary

Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company Limited has discontinued subscription in units of Motilal Oswal Nifty Microcap 250 Index Fund with immediate effect from the cut-off time of January 8, 2026. This action has been taken in consultation with SEBI as microcap is not defined as a category based on market capitalization. The discontinuation affects fresh purchases, additional investments, switch-ins, and new SIP/STP registrations, while existing SIPs/STPs will be paused.

## Key Points

- Fresh and additional purchases through lump sum mode discontinued
- Switch-in transactions from other Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund schemes discontinued
- Fresh registrations under Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) discontinued
- Existing SIPs/STPs paused effective from January 8, 2026
- Subscription amounts received after cut-off time on January 8, 2026 will be refunded without interest
- Switch-in transactions received until January 8, 2026 up to cut-off time will be processed
- Action taken in consultation with SEBI due to microcap not being defined as a category based on market capitalization

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has been consulted regarding this discontinuation due to the lack of a formal definition of "microcap" as a market capitalization-based category. This represents a regulatory clarification that impacts the continued operation of the fund in its current form.

## Compliance Requirements

- Asset Management Company must refund any subscription amounts received after the cut-off time on January 8, 2026 without interest
- All refunds must be processed in accordance with applicable regulations
- The addendum forms an integral part of the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)
- All other terms and conditions of the SID and KIM remain unchanged

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 8, 2026 (cut-off time)
- **Circular Date**: January 9, 2026
- Last date for switch-in transactions: January 8, 2026 (up to cut-off time)

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Existing investors can continue holding their investments, but cannot make fresh purchases or additional investments. New investors are completely barred from entry. Existing SIP/STP arrangements are paused, affecting investors' systematic investment plans.

**Market Impact**: Limited to investors and potential investors of this specific fund. The discontinuation highlights regulatory uncertainty around microcap fund categorization, which may have broader implications for similar funds in the market.

**Operational Impact**: Motilal Oswal AMC must implement immediate controls to reject new subscriptions, pause existing SIPs/STPs, and process refunds for any subscriptions received after the cut-off time. The fund will operate in a closed mode for new investments while continuing to manage existing assets.
