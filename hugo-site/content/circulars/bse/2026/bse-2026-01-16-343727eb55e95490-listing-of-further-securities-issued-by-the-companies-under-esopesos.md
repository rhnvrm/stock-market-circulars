- **Notice Date**: January 16, 2026
- **Effective Trading Date**: January 19, 2026 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Period**: None (NA for all securities)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine administrative listing of ESOP/ESOS shares. The share quantities represent minimal dilution for all companies involved.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal increase in free float for the listed companies. The largest issuances are by ICICI Bank (1.19 million shares) and IDFC First Bank (964,770 shares), which represent very small percentages of their total outstanding shares.

**Trading Impact**: No lock-in restrictions mean all shares are immediately tradable from January 19, 2026, though the volumes are not significant enough to materially affect market liquidity.

**Investor Consideration**: Routine ESOP conversions indicate normal employee compensation practices and should not materially affect stock valuations or trading patterns.
