## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing announcement with limited market impact. The staggered lock-in periods suggest a structured release of promoter or anchor investor holdings over a three-year period. The two "FREE" tranches totaling 2,937,600 shares (approximately 19.5% of total listed shares) will become tradable earliest on January 5, 2026. The phased unlock schedule may help manage supply and price stability in the secondary market.
