## Impact Assessment

**SLB Market Impact**: Market participants with open SLB positions in these seven securities must plan position management strategies before shut periods. The restrictions on fresh lending and borrowing during shut periods may affect liquidity and availability of these securities for short-selling or hedging strategies.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and institutional participants need to inform clients holding SLB positions about the shut periods and ensure timely action to avoid forced closure or penalties. The staggered dates (January 22-27) require careful tracking of multiple deadlines.

**Dividend Entitlement**: The record dates determine dividend eligibility, which affects the pricing and demand dynamics for SLB transactions in these securities leading up to the ex-dates.
