---

## Summary

Varvee Global Ltd (BSE Scrip Code: 514274) has announced a sub-division (stock split) of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of Rs.10/- face value will be split into two equity shares of Rs.5/- face value each. The record date for this corporate action is March 2, 2026.

## Key Points

- Sub-division ratio: 1 equity share of Rs.10/- → 2 equity shares of Rs.5/- each
- Record date: March 2, 2026
- Existing ISIN INE273D01019 (Rs.10/- paid-up) will be invalid for exchange transactions on or after March 2, 2026
- New ISIN for Rs.5/- paid-up shares will be communicated via a separate notice
- Applicable to Dematerialised Securities under Rolling Settlement segment
- Notice reference: DR-831/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

The sub-division is effective under the Dematerialised Securities – Rolling Settlement segment. Trading members must ensure all transactions from March 2, 2026 onwards use the new ISIN number once communicated.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must stop using ISIN INE273D01019 for transactions on or after March 2, 2026
- Members should update their systems with the new ISIN once announced by BSE via a separate notice
- Clearing and settlement operations must reflect the new face value of Rs.5/- per share from the record date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 23, 2026
- **Record Date:** March 2, 2026
- **Old ISIN (INE273D01019) validity ends:** March 2, 2026 (invalid for exchange transactions on or after this date)
- **New ISIN effective date:** March 2, 2026 (to be separately notified)

## Impact Assessment

This sub-division will double the number of outstanding equity shares of Varvee Global Ltd while halving the face value from Rs.10/- to Rs.5/-. The market price per share is expected to adjust proportionally. Trading members and depository participants must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN and face value. Investors holding shares in demat form will see their holdings doubled automatically. The change is limited to Varvee Global Ltd and has no broader market impact beyond participants trading this scrip.
