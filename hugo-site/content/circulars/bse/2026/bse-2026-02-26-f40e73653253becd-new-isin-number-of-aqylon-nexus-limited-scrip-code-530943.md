This is a continuation of the earlier Exchange Notice No. 20260219-10 dated February 19, 2026.

- The new ISIN is effective for all trades on and from the ex-date: **05-03-2026**
- Reference DR number: 833/2025-2026
- This notice continues from Exchange Notice No. 20260219-10 dated February 19, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This is an operational update consequent to a corporate action (share sub-division) approved under the exchange's listing compliance process.

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to trading members and investors holding or trading AQYLON NEXUS LIMITED (Scrip Code: 530943). The change in face value from Rs.10/- to Re.1/- will increase the number of shares proportionally (10x), and the new ISIN must be used for settlement of trades from the ex-date onwards. Back-office and depository systems should be updated prior to March 5, 2026 to avoid settlement failures.
