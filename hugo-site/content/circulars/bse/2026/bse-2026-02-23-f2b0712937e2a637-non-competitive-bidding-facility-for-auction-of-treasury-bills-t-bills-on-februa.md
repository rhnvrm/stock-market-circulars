This is a routine operational circular for debt market participants. Trading members and direct investors seeking to participate in the non-competitive segment of the GoI T-Bill auction must act within the specified bid collection windows. The total issuance of ₹34,000 crore across three maturities (91-day, 182-day, 364-day) provides short-term government paper across multiple tenors. Impact is limited to debt market participants using BSE's iBBS platform; no impact on equity markets or broader regulatory compliance obligations.
