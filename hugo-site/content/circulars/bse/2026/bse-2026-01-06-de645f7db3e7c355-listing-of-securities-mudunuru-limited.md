## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new shares available for trading
- All 11,20,000 shares are subject to lock-in restrictions and cannot be traded until the lock-in period expires

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a relatively small preferential allotment representing incremental equity capital for Mudunuru Limited. The shares are locked-in for 2 years, preventing immediate trading impact.

**Operational Impact**: Routine listing process with no special settlement or trading requirements beyond the lock-in restrictions.

**Investor Consideration**: The preferential issue to promoters at Rs. 12.00 per share increases promoter holding. Investors should note the dilution effect and monitor promoter commitment through the lock-in period.
