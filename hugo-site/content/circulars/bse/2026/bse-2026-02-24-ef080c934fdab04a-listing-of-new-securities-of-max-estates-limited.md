## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 11,41,552 equity shares to Max Estates Limited's share capital, issued to Promoters at Rs. 657/- per share via warrant conversion. Since all newly listed shares are under lock-in until August 31, 2027, there is no immediate increase in free-float or market liquidity. The preferential allotment to Promoters may slightly increase promoter shareholding percentage. Market impact is limited in the short term due to the lock-in restriction.
