**Trading Impact**: From January 23, 2026, the stock will trade ex-rights, meaning new buyers will not be entitled to participate in the rights issue. The stock price is expected to adjust downward to reflect the value of the rights entitlement being separated.

**Market Operations**: Trading members must ensure proper handling of ex-rights transactions from the specified date to maintain market integrity and accurate settlement.
