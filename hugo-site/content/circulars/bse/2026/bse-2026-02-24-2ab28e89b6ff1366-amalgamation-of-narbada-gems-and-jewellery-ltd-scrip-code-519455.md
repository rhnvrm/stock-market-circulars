A record date of **27 February 2026** has been fixed to determine shareholder entitlements. Trading in Narbada Gems and Jewellery Ltd equity shares is suspended with effect from 27 February 2026.

## Key Points

- **Share swap ratio:** 4,623 fully paid-up equity shares of Uday Jewellery Industries Ltd (face value ₹10/- each) will be issued and allotted for every 10,000 fully paid-up equity shares of Narbada Gems and Jewellery Ltd (face value ₹10/- each) held.

| Record Date (Amalgamation Entitlement) | 27 February 2026 |
| Trading Suspension Effective From | 27 February 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

Shareholders of Narbada Gems and Jewellery Ltd (519455) will receive 4,623 equity shares of Uday Jewellery Industries Ltd for every 10,000 shares held — an effective swap ratio of approximately 0.4623:1. The trading suspension from 27 February 2026 means there is very limited time (3 calendar days from circular date) for any market transactions in NARBADA shares. Investors holding NARBADA must be aware that liquidity will cease on the record date and positions will be converted per the NCLT-approved scheme. The merger consolidates both entities under Uday Jewellery Industries Ltd.
