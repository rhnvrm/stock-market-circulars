## Impact Assessment

**Market Operations Impact:**
Medium impact on SLB segment operations. Participants with open positions in these 10 securities must plan position management around shut periods. Failure to close positions before shut periods will result in mandatory delivery obligations.

**Trading Impact:**
Limited direct trading impact, but SLB participants may need to adjust strategies. Securities with shut periods may see reduced liquidity in lending/borrowing markets during affected dates.

**Operational Requirements:**
SLB participants must update systems and processes to account for shut periods. Risk management teams should monitor exposures in affected securities leading up to shut periods.
