## Compliance Requirements

- Members with short delivery positions in the listed securities must fulfill obligations through the demat auction process.
- Buying members entitled to receive the auctioned securities will receive shares at the auction price or a close-out rate as per BSE rules.
- All participants must comply with BSE's demat auction procedures and timelines for Settlement No. 823.

## Important Dates

- **Auction Date / Settlement Date:** February 20, 2026
- **Settlement No.:** 823

## Impact Assessment

The auction affects a diverse set of 92 securities, indicating a routine but broad settlement shortfall for this cycle. The inclusion of widely-held stocks such as Infosys, TCS, JSW Steel, Mahindra & Mahindra, Marico, and Punjab National Bank suggests minor short-delivery incidents rather than systemic failures. The large quantity in Kretto Sysco (40,000 shares) and BLB Ltd. (11,395 shares) may indicate more material delivery failures for those counters. Affected buyers will receive close-out compensation per BSE norms. No broader market disruption is anticipated.
