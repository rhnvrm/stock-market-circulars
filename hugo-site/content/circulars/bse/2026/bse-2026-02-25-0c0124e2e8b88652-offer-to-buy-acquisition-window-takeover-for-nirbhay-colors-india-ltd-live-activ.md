## Impact Assessment

This circular is operationally relevant to Trading Members and Custodians who hold or manage shares of NIRBHAY COLORS INDIA LTD (scrip code 526349). The offer is at par value (Rs. 10.00), which may limit participation interest unless current market price is at or below the offer price. The offer size of ~14.8 lakh shares is moderate in scale. Members should ensure timely UCC compliance and platform readiness (iBBS/RTRMS) ahead of the 26th February 2026 opening. Broader market impact is minimal as this pertains to a single company's takeover window.
