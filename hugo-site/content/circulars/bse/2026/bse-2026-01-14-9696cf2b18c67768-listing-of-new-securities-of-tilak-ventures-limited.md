## Impact Assessment

This is a significant rights issue for Tilak Ventures Limited with approximately 89.14 crore new equity shares being listed. The large number of shares issued indicates substantial dilution for existing shareholders who did not participate in the rights issue. The shares being issued at par (Re. 1/-) and ranking pari-passu with existing shares means new shareholders will have equal voting and dividend rights. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and adjust position limits accordingly.
