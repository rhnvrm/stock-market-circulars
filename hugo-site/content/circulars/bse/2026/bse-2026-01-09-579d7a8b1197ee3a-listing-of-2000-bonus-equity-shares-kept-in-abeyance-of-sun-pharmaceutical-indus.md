## Impact Assessment

The impact is minimal as only 2000 bonus shares are being released from abeyance for Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. This represents a negligible addition to the existing float and is unlikely to have any material effect on the stock's trading or market capitalization. This is a routine administrative action to resolve previously held-in-abeyance bonus shares.
