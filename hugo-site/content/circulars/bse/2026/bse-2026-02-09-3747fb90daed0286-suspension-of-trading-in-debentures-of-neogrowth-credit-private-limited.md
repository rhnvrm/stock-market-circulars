BSE has announced the suspension of trading in specific debentures of NEOGROWTH CREDIT PRIVATE LIMITED (ISIN: INE814O07493, Code: 975431) effective February 12, 2026. The suspension is implemented due to the company fixing a record date for redemption of its 11.75% Non-Convertible Debentures maturing on February 27, 2026. Trading members are strictly advised not to deal in these debentures from the no-dealings date.
