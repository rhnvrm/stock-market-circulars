---

## Summary

BSE has published the trading and settlement programme for the Mutual Fund segment covering February 1-28, 2026. The circular outlines settlement numbers, dates, and fund payout schedules for mutual fund subscriptions (both liquid and non-liquid schemes) and redemptions processed through the BSE Star MF Platform.

## Key Points

- Settlement cycle covers 20 trading days from February 2-27, 2026 (settlement numbers 2526207 to 2526226)
- Non-liquid MF subscriptions follow T+1 settlement cycle (funds payin on T, units payout on T+1)
- Liquid MF subscriptions have same-day settlement (T+0)
- Non-liquid funds payout to AMCs happens before 3:00 PM on T day
- NFO scheme payouts occur on T day based on funds confirmation received by ICCL by 6:00 PM
- Redemption settlement varies by scheme TAT (T+1 to T+10 days)
- Settlement number 2526220 (February 19) appears only in redemption schedule

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must follow the published settlement schedule for mutual fund transactions
- Investors should verify scheme-specific redemption TAT from the scheme master on BSE Star MF Platform
- AMCs must be ready to receive funds payout before 3:00 PM on transaction day for non-liquid schemes
- ICCL must receive funds confirmation by 6:00 PM on T day for NFO scheme payouts

## Important Dates

- **February 2-27, 2026**: Trading and settlement period covered by this schedule
- **Excluded dates**: February 7, 8, 14, 15, 21, 22, 28 (weekends/holidays - no settlement)
- **Daily cutoff**: 3:00 PM for non-liquid funds payout to AMCs
- **NFO cutoff**: 6:00 PM for funds confirmation to ICCL

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a standard monthly operational schedule that ensures smooth functioning of mutual fund trading and settlement on BSE platform.

**Operational Impact**: Provides clarity to market participants, AMCs, and investors on exact settlement timelines for planning cash flows and unit allocations. The clear distinction between liquid and non-liquid scheme settlement cycles helps participants manage their operations efficiently.
