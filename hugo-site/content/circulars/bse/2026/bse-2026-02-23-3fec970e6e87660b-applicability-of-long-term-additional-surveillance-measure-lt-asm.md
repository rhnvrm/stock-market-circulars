## Impact Assessment

The placement of 13 securities under the Long Term ASM framework has a high impact on retail and institutional investors holding these stocks. LT-ASM classification typically results in enhanced margin requirements, restricted trading conditions, and increased scrutiny, which can lead to reduced liquidity and potential price impact for the affected securities. Investors in Aarey Drugs & Pharmaceuticals, Apt Packaging, Bombay Talkies, Eforu Entertainment, Gconnect Logitech, Kretto Syscon, NDA Securities, Sayaji Industries, Som Datt Finance Corporation, Thakral Services India, Triton Valves, Udayshivakumar Infra, and Universal Office Automation should review their positions and be aware of the applicable surveillance conditions. The absence of any exits from the LT-ASM framework in this update indicates continued regulatory concern across the broader list of monitored securities.
