## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - This auction affects over 100 securities across various market segments. While routine in nature, the large number of scrips and significant quantities in some cases (particularly HARSHIL AGRO, RAJNISH WELL) indicate notable delivery shortages.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Brokers and clearing members with short positions in these securities must participate in the auction, potentially at prices higher than market rates. This could impact their settlement costs and client relationships.

**Investor Impact**: Low to Medium - Investors in these securities may experience temporary price volatility around the auction. Those expecting delivery may face delays until auction settlement is complete.
