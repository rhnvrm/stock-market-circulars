## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders and traders of this specific debenture series. Bank of Baroda's exercise of the call option on perpetual AT1 bonds indicates proactive liability management. The suspension is temporary and procedural, affecting only this particular ISIN.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders on record as of January 12, 2026 will receive interest payment and redemption proceeds. Liquidity for this instrument ceases from the no-dealings date, preventing any trading activity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update systems and communication protocols to prevent inadvertent trading in these debentures. The suspension is limited in scope to a single instrument series.
