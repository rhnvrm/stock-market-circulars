## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The preferential issuance represents a substantial increase in unit count for Mindspace Business Parks REIT. The staggered lock-in structure with 22 separate tranches alternating between 2027 and 2029 expiry dates indicates structured sponsor commitment and prevents immediate supply pressure.

**Investor Impact**: Existing unitholders face dilution from the 39.16 million new units. However, the preferential issuance to sponsors at Rs. 464.64 demonstrates sponsor confidence and capital commitment. The extensive lock-in periods provide assurance against near-term selling pressure from these units.

**Operational Impact**: The alternating lock-in pattern (odd lots locked till 2029, even lots till 2027) suggests a strategic approach to gradual liquidity enhancement while maintaining sponsor alignment over an extended period.
