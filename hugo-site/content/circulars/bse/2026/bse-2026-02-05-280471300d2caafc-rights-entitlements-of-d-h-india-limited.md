## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects D & H India Limited shareholders who wish to participate in or renounce their rights. The short 4-day renunciation window requires prompt decision-making by investors.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure proper client communication and include mandatory disclaimers in contract notes. The trade-for-trade settlement on T+1 basis requires careful position management.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders must act within the specified timeframe. Failure to either subscribe with application money or renounce REs before February 17, 2026 will result in permanent lapse of entitlements.
