## Regulatory Context

Demat auctions are conducted by the exchange to settle shortages when selling brokers fail to deliver securities to buying brokers on the settlement date. The exchange buys these securities through auction and delivers them to the buying broker, with the costs and penalties borne by the defaulting selling broker.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members with short delivery positions in the listed securities must participate in the auction
- Members must ensure adequate funds for auction purchases
- Defaulting members will be subject to penalties and charges as per BSE regulations
- All auction settlements must be completed as per the exchange timeline

## Important Dates

- Auction Date: January 29, 2026
- Settlement No: 807

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The auction involves 143 securities with varying quantities, indicating delivery failures across multiple scrips. While most quantities are relatively small, some securities like Deep Diamond show significant shortages.

**Broker Impact**: Medium to High - Brokers with short positions in these securities will face additional costs through auction prices, which are typically at a premium to market prices, plus applicable penalties.

**Investor Impact**: Low to Medium - Investors awaiting delivery of these securities will receive their shares through the auction mechanism, though there may be delays in receipt compared to normal settlement cycles.
