---

## Summary

BSE has declared January 15, 2026 as a trading holiday for multiple segments due to Municipal Corporation Elections scheduled in Maharashtra. The Equity Segment, Equity Derivatives Segment, and morning sessions of Commodity Derivatives and Electronic Gold Receipts will remain closed. Critically, equity derivative contracts scheduled to expire on January 15, 2026 have been preponed to January 14, 2026.

## Key Points

- Trading holiday on January 15, 2026 for equity and equity derivatives segments
- Equity Derivatives contracts expiring January 15, 2026 preponed to January 14, 2026
- Changes reflected in end-of-day contract master files
- Commodity Derivatives Segment: Morning session (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM) closed, evening session (5:00 PM - 11:55 PM) operational
- Electronic Gold Receipts (EGR): Morning session (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM) closed, evening session (5:00 PM - 9:30 PM) operational
- Continuation of earlier notice 20260109-16

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a one-time operational adjustment for the election holiday.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the complete closure of equity and equity derivatives segments on January 15, 2026
- Participants holding equity derivative positions expiring on January 15 must manage positions by January 14, 2026
- Commodity and EGR traders should adjust to evening-only sessions on January 15, 2026
- Update systems with revised contract master files reflecting preponed expiry dates

## Important Dates

- **January 12, 2026**: Notice issued, contract master files updated with preponed expiry dates
- **January 14, 2026**: New expiry date for equity derivatives originally scheduled for January 15, 2026
- **January 15, 2026**: Trading holiday (Municipal Corporation Elections)
  - Equity Segment: Closed all day
  - Equity Derivatives Segment: Closed all day
  - Commodity Derivatives: Evening session only (5:00 PM - 11:55 PM)
  - Electronic Gold Receipts: Evening session only (5:00 PM - 9:30 PM)

## Impact Assessment

**High impact on market operations and participants:**

- **Equity traders**: Complete halt in equity trading for one full day affects intraday and positional strategies
- **Derivatives traders**: Critical impact due to preponed expiry requiring immediate position adjustments. Traders must square off or roll over positions one day earlier than originally planned
- **Liquidity**: Reduced trading opportunity may impact market liquidity and price discovery
- **Commodity traders**: Limited to evening sessions only, reducing trading hours from 15 hours to 7 hours
- **EGR participants**: Trading window reduced to 4.5 hours (evening only)
- **Risk management**: Shortened timeframe for expiry management may increase operational risk for derivatives participants
