title: Launch of Aditya Birla Sun Life BSE Top 10 Banks ETF NFO on BSE StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund is launching the Aditya Birla Sun Life BSE Top 10 Banks ETF (and its Direct Plan variant) as a New Fund Offer (NFO) on the BSE StAR MF Platform. The NFO subscription window runs from February 23 to February 25, 2026, with tentative unit allotment on February 27, 2026.

## Key Points

- NFO subscription period: February 23, 2026 to February 25, 2026
- Two schemes offered: Aditya Birla Sun Life BSE Top 10 Banks ETF and its Direct Plan — both under the Equity category
- Tentative allotment date: February 27, 2026
- NFO extended till midnight on February 25, 2026, for lumpsum purchases only on BSE StAR MF Platform
- Transactions where clients have not initiated funds by 9:00 AM on T+1 will be cancelled; CC with N flag will be reported to RTA/AMC
- Transactions with initiated payments remain pending until 3:00 PM on the last day of fund payout to AMC, or T+5, whichever is earlier

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. The circular operates within existing BSE StAR MF NFO transaction and settlement framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must ensure clear funds are available in the ICCL Account by 6:00 PM on February 27, 2026, to secure unit allotment
- Cheque and OTM payments are acceptable during the NFO period, subject to receipt of clear funds in the ICCL account by 6:00 PM on February 27, 2026
- Transactions without client fund initiation by 9:00 AM on T+1 will be cancelled; members must communicate this deadline to clients

## Important Dates

- **February 23, 2026**: NFO subscription opens
- **February 25, 2026**: NFO subscription closes (extended till midnight for lumpsum purchases)
- **February 27, 2026**: Tentative unit allotment date; clear funds must be in ICCL Account by 6:00 PM

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine NFO launch announcement with low market-wide impact. It is relevant primarily to BSE members and distributors facilitating mutual fund transactions on BSE StAR MF. Investors seeking exposure to the top 10 banking stocks via an ETF structure will have a short 3-day subscription window. The banking sector focus means performance will track the BSE Top 10 Banks index. No broader market disruption or systemic compliance burden is anticipated.
