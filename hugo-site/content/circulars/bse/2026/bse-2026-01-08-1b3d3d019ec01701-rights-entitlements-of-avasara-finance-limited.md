## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium impact limited to shareholders and trading members dealing with AVASARA FINANCE LIMITED. Existing shareholders will have the opportunity to renounce their rights entitlements during the specified trading period. The trade-for-trade settlement and dematerialized-only requirement ensures transparency and reduces settlement risk. Non-subscribed and non-renounced REs will lapse after the issue closing date, potentially affecting shareholders who do not take action within the specified timeframe.
