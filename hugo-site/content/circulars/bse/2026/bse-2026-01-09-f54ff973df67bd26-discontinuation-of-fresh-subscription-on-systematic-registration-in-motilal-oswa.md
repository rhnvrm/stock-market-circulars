Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company Limited has discontinued subscription in units of Motilal Oswal Nifty Microcap 250 Index Fund with immediate effect from the cut-off time of January 8, 2026. This decision was made in consultation with SEBI as microcap is not defined as a category based on market capitalization. The discontinuation includes fresh purchases, additional purchases, switch-ins, new SIP/STP registrations, and pausing of existing SIPs/STPs.

- Existing SIPs/STPs paused effective from January 8, 2026
- Switch-in transactions received till January 8, 2026 up to cut-off time will be processed
- Subscription amounts received after cut-off time will be refunded without interest
- Decision made in consultation with SEBI due to microcap not being defined as a market capitalization category

## Regulatory Changes

The discontinuation is issued in consultation with SEBI due to regulatory concerns that microcap is not defined as a category based on market capitalization. This represents a regulatory clarification affecting how funds can be categorized and offered to investors.

## Compliance Requirements

- Fund house must discontinue all fresh subscriptions immediately
- All subscription amounts received after the cut-off time on January 8, 2026 must be refunded to investors without interest
- Existing SIP/STP registrations must be paused
- Switch-in transactions received till cut-off time on January 8, 2026 must be processed

## Important Dates

- **January 8, 2026**: Effective date and cut-off time for discontinuation
- **January 8, 2026**: Last date for processing switch-in transactions (up to cut-off time)
- **Immediate Effect**: Pausing of existing SIPs/STPs from effective date

## Impact Assessment

This discontinuation has significant impact on existing and potential investors in the Motilal Oswal Nifty Microcap 250 Index Fund. Current investors with active SIPs/STPs will see their systematic investments paused immediately. New investors cannot enter the scheme through any mode (lump sum, SIP, STP, or switch-in). The decision reflects SEBI's regulatory stance on fund categorization and may set a precedent for other microcap-focused funds. Investors seeking microcap exposure will need to explore alternative investment vehicles that comply with SEBI's market capitalization category definitions.
