## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The surveillance framework applies to 13 securities, which may experience increased scrutiny and potentially different trading conditions. The high encumbrance levels indicate significant promoter pledges, which can affect investor sentiment.

**Operational Impact:** Companies under this framework face enhanced monitoring and must maintain strict compliance with disclosure requirements. Six companies exiting the framework indicates either improvement in encumbrance levels or migration to other surveillance categories.

**Investor Impact:** Investors should exercise caution when trading securities under this framework as high promoter encumbrance can indicate financial stress and potential governance concerns.
