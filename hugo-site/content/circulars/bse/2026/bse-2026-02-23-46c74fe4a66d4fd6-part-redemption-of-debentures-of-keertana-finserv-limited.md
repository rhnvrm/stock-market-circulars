- All trades in the debenture on and after the effective date must reflect the reduced face value.

## Impact Assessment

This part redemption affects holders of Keertana Finserv Limited's 11.4% NCD maturing in June 2028 (privately placed). The face value reduction to Rs. 75,000 per debenture indicates a partial principal repayment alongside an interest payment. Impact is limited to existing debenture holders and trading members dealing in this specific ISIN on the BSE debt segment. No broader market impact is anticipated.
