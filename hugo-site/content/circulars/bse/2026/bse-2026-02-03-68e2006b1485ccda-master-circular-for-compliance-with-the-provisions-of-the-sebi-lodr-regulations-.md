This master circular updates the previous version dated November 11, 2024 by incorporating all relevant circulars issued till December 30, 2025.

The consolidation simplifies compliance by providing a single source of truth, reducing the need to track multiple individual circulars. All ongoing compliance activities, investigations, and legal proceedings under previous circulars continue unaffected, ensuring regulatory continuity.
