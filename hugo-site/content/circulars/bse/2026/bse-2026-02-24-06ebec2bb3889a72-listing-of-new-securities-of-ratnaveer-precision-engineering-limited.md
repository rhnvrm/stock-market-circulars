## Impact Assessment

The listing of these 20,27,972 preferentially allotted shares increases the total issued equity share capital of Ratnaveer Precision Engineering Limited. Since these shares are allotted to promoters and carry a lock-in until September 30, 2027, they will not be immediately tradeable by the promoters, limiting short-term dilution impact on the open market. Existing shareholders should note the increase in total share count and corresponding adjustment to per-share metrics. General market liquidity for the scrip is minimally affected in the near term given the lock-in restriction.
