## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Moderate impact on affected securities during ex-dividend and record date periods. Expected temporary price adjustments for dividend-paying stocks.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders must hold securities on record dates to be eligible for dividends and other corporate actions. The DELPHI stock split and bonus issue will affect shareholding patterns and may increase liquidity.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and depositories need to process corporate action entitlements accurately. Multiple CP and NCD redemptions indicate normal debt market operations with scheduled maturities.

**Sector Coverage:** Diverse sectors affected including pharmaceuticals, energy, FMCG, chemicals, IT services, and financial services, indicating broad-based corporate action activity across the market.
