## Key Points

- Scrip Code 540005 (LTIMindtree Limited) will have its BOLT Plus Scrip ID changed from `LTIM` to `LTM`
- The change takes effect from **February 27, 2026**
- The change was initiated at the request of LTIMindtree Limited
- Trading members are required to take note and update their systems accordingly

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes involved. This is a purely administrative update to the internal scrip identifier used within BSE's BOLT Plus trading system.

  - Mr. Tushar Shetty: +91 22 2272 8634 | Listing.crd@bseindia.com
  - Ms. Asmita Chavan: +91 22 2272 8266 | Listing.crd@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 23, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 27, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The impact is minimal and purely operational. The Scrip Code (540005) remains unchanged, so investor portfolios, ISIN, and settlement processes are unaffected. Trading members using automated systems that reference the BOLT Plus Scrip ID by name should update their configurations before February 27, 2026 to avoid any order entry issues.
