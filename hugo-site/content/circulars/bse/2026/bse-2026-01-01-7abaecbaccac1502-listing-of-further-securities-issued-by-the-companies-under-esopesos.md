## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The number of shares being listed is relatively small for both companies and represents routine ESOP/ESOS exercises by employees. 

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible impact on overall liquidity given the small quantity of shares.

**Dilution**: Minor dilution to existing shareholders, consistent with approved employee compensation schemes.

**Lock-in Status**: No lock-in restrictions mean these shares are immediately available for trading, though the small quantities are unlikely to affect market dynamics significantly.
