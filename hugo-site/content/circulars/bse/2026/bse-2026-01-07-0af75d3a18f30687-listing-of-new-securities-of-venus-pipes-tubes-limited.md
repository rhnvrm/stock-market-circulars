## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note:
- New securities of Venus Pipes & Tubes Limited (Scrip Code: 543528) are available for trading from January 8, 2026

- **Trading Commencement Date**: January 8, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a relatively small preferential allotment representing minimal dilution to existing shareholders. The issue of 1,20,000 shares at Rs. 1700/- per share represents approximately Rs. 20.4 crores in capital raised.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new distinctive number range and lock-in restrictions. The lock-in period extending until July 31, 2026 ensures these shares cannot be traded freely for approximately 7 months from the listing date.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible in the short term due to lock-in provisions; post lock-in expiry, the additional shares may provide marginal improvement to trading liquidity.
