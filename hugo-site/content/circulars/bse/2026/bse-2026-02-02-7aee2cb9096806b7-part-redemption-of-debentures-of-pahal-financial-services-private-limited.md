## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This affects only holders of specific privately placed debentures of PAHAL FINANCIAL SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED. The part redemption is a scheduled corporate action that returns capital to debenture holders while maintaining the securities in circulation at reduced face values.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - Trading members need to update face values in their systems for the two affected debenture series. The securities will continue trading with reduced face values, requiring system adjustments but no trading disruption.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for debenture holders who will receive part redemption proceeds along with interest payment on the record date, while retaining exposure to the remaining principal amount at reduced face values.
