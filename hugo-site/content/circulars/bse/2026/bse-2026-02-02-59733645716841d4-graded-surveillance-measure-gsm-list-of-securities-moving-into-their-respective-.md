## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Six securities face enhanced surveillance with varying degrees of trading restrictions based on their GSM stage placement.

**Liquidity Impact**: Securities in higher GSM stages (Stage IV) will experience more severe liquidity constraints compared to lower stages.

**Investor Impact**: Existing holders and potential investors should be aware of increased margin requirements, price bands, and other restrictions applicable under the GSM framework for these securities.
