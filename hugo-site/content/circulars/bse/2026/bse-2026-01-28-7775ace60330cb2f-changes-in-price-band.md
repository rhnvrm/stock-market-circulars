## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Price band revisions directly affect intraday trading volatility. Tighter bands (2%-5%) indicate heightened surveillance concerns and restrict price movements, potentially reducing liquidity and trading volumes. Wider bands (20%) suggest normalization or reduced surveillance.

**Trading Impact**: 
- CHPL Industries Ltd faces the tightest restriction at 2%, significantly limiting price discovery
- Gabion Technologies India Ltd has the widest band at 20%, allowing normal price movements
- Six securities have moderate restrictions (10% bands)
- Three securities have 5% bands indicating moderate surveillance concern

**Investor Impact**: Investors in these securities should be aware of limited price movement ranges, which may affect entry/exit strategies and order execution.
