## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to a routine mutual fund NFO launch. The impact is limited to:

- Members of BSE StAR MF Platform who wish to participate in the NFO
- Investors interested in silver-themed investment products through fund-of-fund structure
- Operational compliance for brokers/members handling NFO subscriptions on the platform

The strict fund settlement timelines and cancellation provisions for unfunded transactions ensure operational discipline but do not affect broader market operations. The silver ETF FOF offers investors exposure to silver through a fund-of-fund structure, providing diversification options in the precious metals segment.
