- **Notice Date:** February 24, 2026
- **Effective Trading Date:** February 25, 2026 (Wednesday)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. ESOP/ESOS listings are routine corporate actions representing employee compensation conversions into tradeable equity. The share quantities are small relative to the total outstanding capital of the companies involved, particularly for large-cap names like HDFC Bank (Scrip Code: 500180) and Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (Scrip Code: 500570). No lock-in period applies, so shares are immediately available for trading, but dilution effect is negligible. Xtglobal Infotech (531225) has the proportionally larger issuance of 561,500 shares and may see marginally higher relative impact given its smaller market cap.
