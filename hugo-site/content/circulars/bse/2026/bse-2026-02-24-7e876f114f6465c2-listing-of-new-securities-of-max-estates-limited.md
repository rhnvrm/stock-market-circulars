## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 11,41,552 shares to the total issued capital of Max Estates Limited. However, since all newly listed shares are subject to a lock-in period until August 31, 2027, there is no immediate increase in freely tradeable float. Market impact is expected to be minimal in the near term. The preferential allotment to promoters at Rs. 657/- per share (premium of Rs. 647/- over face value of Rs. 10/-) reflects promoter confidence in the company's valuation.
