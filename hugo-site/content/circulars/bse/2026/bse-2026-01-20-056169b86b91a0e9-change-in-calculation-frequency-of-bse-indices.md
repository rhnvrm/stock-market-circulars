## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 20, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 27, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The change affects data availability and frequency for three widely-tracked BSE indices. Market participants relying on real-time values for these specific indices will need to adjust their systems and processes.

**Operational Impact**: Users of BSE Largecap, Midcap, and Smallcap indices will receive updates only at end-of-day rather than continuously throughout trading hours. This may affect algorithmic trading strategies, portfolio tracking systems, and other applications that rely on intraday index values.

**Note**: The flagship SENSEX index is not affected by this change and continues with its existing calculation frequency.
