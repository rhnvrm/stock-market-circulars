## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework list has been revised with additions and stage escalations. The consolidated list of all securities currently under ESM includes a large number of companies across ESM Stage I and Stage II. Securities marked with # are SME scrips, and securities marked with * are as per NSE data. Securities marked (~) will continue in Trade for Trade as per circulars 20251127-51 and 20260105-26 dated November 27, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised ESM list and apply applicable trading restrictions for newly added and stage-escalated securities from February 26, 2026
- Securities under ESM are subject to Trade for Trade settlement and applicable price bands as per the relevant ESM stage
- Investors and traders holding or intending to trade in the listed securities must comply with ESM framework restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** February 26, 2026 — All additions, stage changes, and removals take effect
- **Circular Date:** February 25, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 3 securities and escalation of 4 securities to higher ESM stages will impose stricter trading restrictions on these scrips, including Trade for Trade settlement and tighter price bands. This limits intraday trading and speculative activity in these securities. Investors holding positions in these securities should be aware of reduced liquidity and heightened regulatory scrutiny. The impact is confined to the specific securities listed and does not affect broader market operations.
