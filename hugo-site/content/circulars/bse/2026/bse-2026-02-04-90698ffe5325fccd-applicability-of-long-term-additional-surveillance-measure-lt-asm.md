title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has updated the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective February 05, 2026. One new security (CWD Ltd) has been added to the framework. Mizzen Ventures Ltd will be moved to Stage II ASM. Two securities (Dev Labtech Venture Ltd and Dhanashree Electronics Ltd) are moving out of the LT-ASM framework. The circular also provides a consolidated list of 19+ securities currently under various ASM stages.

## Key Points

- CWD Ltd (Scrip Code: 543378, ISIN: INE0H8H01019) newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework
- Mizzen Ventures Ltd (Scrip Code: 531537, ISIN: INE681K01026) moved to higher ASM Stage II
- No securities moving to lower ASM stages
- No securities shortlisted for direct Stage IV placement
- Dev Labtech Venture Ltd and Dhanashree Electronics Ltd exiting LT-ASM framework
- Consolidated list includes securities in Stage I, II, and IV classifications
- Changes effective from February 05, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework continues BSE's surveillance mechanism to monitor securities with specific risk characteristics. Securities can be placed in different stages (I, II, IV) with progressively stricter trading restrictions. Movement between stages is based on ongoing assessment of trading patterns and compliance metrics. Securities may exit LT-ASM due to inclusion in other frameworks like Trade for Trade, GSM (Graded Surveillance Measure), ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure), or IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised ASM classifications for affected securities
- Trading members should update systems to reflect stage-specific restrictions for securities moving to higher ASM stages
- Additional margin requirements and trading restrictions apply based on ASM stage classification
- Members must comply with framework-specific requirements for securities under LT-ASM surveillance

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 05, 2026 - All changes to LT-ASM framework become applicable
- **Circular Date**: February 04, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact**: The surveillance framework directly affects trading liquidity and conditions for the listed securities. CWD Ltd entering LT-ASM will face surveillance-related restrictions. Mizzen Ventures Ltd moving to Stage II will experience stricter trading conditions including higher margins and potential price bands. The two securities exiting LT-ASM may face different restrictions under their new frameworks. Market participants holding or trading these securities must adjust strategies accordingly. The consolidated list provides transparency on all securities under enhanced surveillance, affecting investor confidence and trading volumes in these stocks.
