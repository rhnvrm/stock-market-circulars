## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular communicates a SAT judicial order directing SEBI to implement the conditional stay on its debarment decision in the matter of alleged irregular trading activities in Du Digital Technologies Limited (now Du Digital Global Limited).

## Compliance Requirements

- **Appellant (Vyas Jitendrakumar Hasmukhlal HUF):** Must deposit 50% of the penalty amount within four weeks from 13 February 2026 (deadline: on or before 13 March 2026) to avail the stay on debarment
- **SEBI:** Must file reply within six weeks of the SAT order; must hold deposited penalty amount in an interest-bearing account pending appeal outcome
- **BSE:** Required to disseminate the SAT order and SEBI direction to market participants as per regulatory obligations

## Important Dates

- **13 February 2026:** Date of SAT order (Appeal No. 32 of 2026)
- **On or before 13 March 2026:** Deadline for appellant to deposit 50% of penalty amount to activate the stay

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. The SAT order pertains to a specific individual/HUF entity (Vyas Jitendrakumar Hasmukhlal HUF) and does not alter trading conditions in Du Digital Global Limited for the broader market.

**Regulatory Impact:** Medium. The conditional stay on a SEBI debarment order demonstrates the SAT's supervisory role in reviewing enforcement actions; outcome of the appeal could have precedential value for similar cases involving limited-trade entities.

**Affected Parties:** Directly impacts only the appellant (Vyas Jitendrakumar Hasmukhlal HUF) and SEBI's enforcement division. Market participants in Du Digital Global Limited (NSE/BSE ticker: DUDIGITAL) are not directly affected by this order.
