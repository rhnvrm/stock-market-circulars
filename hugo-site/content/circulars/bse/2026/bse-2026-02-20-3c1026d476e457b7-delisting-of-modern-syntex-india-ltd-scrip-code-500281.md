## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that Modern Syntex India Ltd. (Scrip Code: 500281) will be delisted from the Exchange with effect from Friday, February 27, 2026. The delisting follows a Resolution Plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Jaipur Bench, vide its order dated March 12, 2024, and the company has confirmed compliance with all NCLT requirements.

## Key Points

- Modern Syntex India Ltd. applied for delisting pursuant to the NCLT Jaipur Bench Resolution Plan order dated March 12, 2024.
- The company has confirmed full compliance with the NCLT delisting requirements.
- The scrip (Code: 500281) will be removed from BSE Exchange records effective February 27, 2026.
- Trading members are advised to take note and act accordingly.

## Regulatory Changes

The delisting is mandated under an NCLT-approved Resolution Plan — not a voluntary or exchange-initiated action — meaning it is driven by insolvency/restructuring proceedings rather than standard SEBI delisting regulations. No new regulatory framework is introduced; existing NCLT and SEBI delisting norms apply.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease trading in Modern Syntex India Ltd. equity shares from the effective delisting date (February 27, 2026).
- Members should update client portfolios and back-office records to reflect the delisting.
- Any open positions or holdings in the scrip should be reviewed and communicated to clients immediately.
- For clarifications, trading members may contact Ms. Vaidehi Phatak at Tel. No. 022-2272 8646.

## Important Dates

- **NCLT Order Date:** March 12, 2024
- **BSE Notice Date:** February 20, 2026
- **Effective Delisting Date:** Friday, February 27, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The delisting of Modern Syntex India Ltd. will result in the permanent removal of the scrip from BSE trading and settlement systems. Shareholders holding equity in the company will no longer be able to trade their shares on the Exchange post February 27, 2026. Given the NCLT-driven nature of this delisting (insolvency resolution), recovery options for shareholders may be limited and governed by the approved Resolution Plan. Trading members with client exposure to this scrip must proactively communicate the delisting and its implications.
