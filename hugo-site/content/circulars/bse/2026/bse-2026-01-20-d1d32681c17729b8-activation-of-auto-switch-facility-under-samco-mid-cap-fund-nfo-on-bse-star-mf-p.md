## Summary

BSE has activated the auto switch facility for SAMCO MID CAP FUND New Fund Offer (NFO) on the BSE StAR MF platform. This facility allows investors to automatically switch their investments between the SAMCO Mid Cap Fund NFO and other SAMCO schemes including Overnight Fund and Arbitrage Fund, available in both direct and regular growth plan variants.

## Key Points

- Four new auto-switch schemes are now available for subscription on BSE StAR MF platform
- Auto-switch facility connects SAMCO MID CAP FUND NFO with SAMCO Overnight Fund (Direct Growth and Regular Growth)
- Auto-switch facility also available between SAMCO MID CAP FUND NFO and SAMCO Arbitrage Fund (Direct Plan Growth and Regular Plan Growth)
- This facility is specific to the New Fund Offer period of SAMCO MID CAP FUND

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational update regarding the activation of a platform feature for a specific mutual fund offering.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements for market participants. This is an informational circular about platform functionality availability.

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: January 20, 2026
- Effective Date: Immediate (facility now active)

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to investors interested in subscribing to the SAMCO MID CAP FUND NFO. The auto-switch facility provides additional flexibility for investors to manage their portfolio allocation between equity-oriented mid-cap funds and lower-risk overnight/arbitrage funds. This is a positive development for SAMCO Mutual Fund investors but has no broader market implications. The facility enhances the BSE StAR MF platform's functionality for systematic investment and portfolio rebalancing strategies.
