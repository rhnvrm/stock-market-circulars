## Impact Assessment

This SDL auction provides investment opportunities in state government securities across 15 states with varying maturity profiles (2030-2056). The Rs. 36,000 crore total size represents significant borrowing by state governments. Karnataka has the largest allocation at Rs. 6,000 crore (3 securities), followed by Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu at Rs. 5,200 crore each. The non-competitive bidding facility enables retail and smaller institutional investors to participate in SDL auctions without price discovery risk. Impact is moderate as this is a routine debt market operation, though the size and geographic diversity provide broad market participation opportunities.
