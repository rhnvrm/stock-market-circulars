## Summary

BSE has issued notice that Modern Syntex India Ltd. (scrip code 500281) will be delisted from the exchange effective Friday, February 27, 2026. The delisting follows a Resolution Plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Jaipur Bench, vide its order dated March 12, 2024, and the company's confirmation that all conditions of the NCLT order have been complied with.

## Key Points

- Modern Syntex India Ltd. (BSE scrip code: 500281) is being delisted from BSE.
- Delisting is pursuant to the NCLT-approved Resolution Plan, not a voluntary or regulatory delisting in the ordinary course.
- The company has confirmed full compliance with the requirements stipulated in the NCLT order dated March 12, 2024.
- Effective date of delisting from BSE exchange records: Friday, February 27, 2026.
- Contact for clarifications: Ms. Vaidehi Phatak, Tel. No. 022–2272 8646.

## Regulatory Changes

The delisting is governed by the Resolution Plan approved by the Hon'ble NCLT, Jaipur Bench, under insolvency proceedings. This is a court/tribunal-directed corporate action rather than a market-initiated regulatory change. No new SEBI regulations are introduced by this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are requested to take note of the delisting and cease trading in the scrip effective February 27, 2026.
- No further trading in Modern Syntex India Ltd. equity shares (scrip code 500281) will be permissible on BSE after the effective date.
- Members with open positions or client holdings should ensure appropriate client communication and settlement actions before the delisting date.

## Important Dates

- **March 12, 2024**: NCLT, Jaipur Bench approved the Resolution Plan ordering delisting.
- **February 20, 2026**: BSE notice issued (Notice No. 20260220-48).
- **February 27, 2026**: Effective date of delisting from BSE exchange records.

## Impact Assessment

The delisting of Modern Syntex India Ltd. has a high direct impact on existing shareholders and trading members holding or dealing in the scrip. Once delisted, the shares will no longer be tradable on BSE, significantly limiting liquidity and exit options for investors. As this delisting is pursuant to an NCLT Resolution Plan (insolvency-related), shareholders may have limited or no recourse for value recovery through normal market mechanisms. Trading members should proactively notify affected clients and ensure all pending transactions are settled before February 27, 2026.
