title: Change in Status of Nutraplus India Limited from Delisted to Suspended
---

## Summary

BSE has announced that the delisting of Nutraplus India Limited (Scrip Code: 524764) has been rescinded pursuant to an order issued by the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). The company's status will be changed from "Delisted" to "Suspended" effective January 28, 2026. As a result, the provisions of Regulation 34(1) and Regulation 34(2) of SEBI Delisting Regulations, 2021 will no longer apply to the company.

## Key Points

- Scrip Code: 524764 - Nutraplus India Limited
- Status change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"
- Change based on order from Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT)
- SEBI Delisting Regulations 34(1) and 34(2) no longer applicable
- Notice issued by BSE Listing Compliance team

## Regulatory Changes

The SAT order has resulted in the rescission of the delisting action previously taken against Nutraplus India Limited. Consequently, Regulation 34(1) and Regulation 34(2) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2021 are no longer applicable to the company. The company returns to suspended status rather than delisted status.

## Compliance Requirements

Nutraplus India Limited will be subject to compliance requirements applicable to suspended companies rather than delisted entities. The company will no longer be governed by the specific delisting regulation provisions mentioned (Regulations 34(1) and 34(2)).

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 23, 2026
- **Effective Date of Status Change**: January 28, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This status change represents a reversal of the delisting action following SAT intervention. While the company moves from delisted to suspended status, trading remains suspended. The change primarily affects the regulatory framework governing the company and may provide a pathway for potential future relisting if the company addresses the underlying issues that led to suspension. Shareholders and market participants should note that this does not immediately restore trading in the security.
