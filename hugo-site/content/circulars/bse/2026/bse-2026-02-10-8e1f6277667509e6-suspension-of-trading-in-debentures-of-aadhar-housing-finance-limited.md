Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the suspension date.

## Important Dates

- **February 10, 2026**: Circular issuance date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of AADHAR HOUSING FINANCE LIMITED's specific debenture series (AHDL-9.55%-1-3-26-PVT). The suspension is temporary and procedural in nature, facilitating the company's obligation to redeem debentures and pay interest to eligible holders.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders on record as of February 13, 2026 will be eligible for redemption proceeds and interest payment. Trading suspension prevents market activity during the record date determination period, which is standard practice for corporate actions in debt securities.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trades in the suspended debenture and inform clients holding or interested in this instrument about the suspension and upcoming redemption.
