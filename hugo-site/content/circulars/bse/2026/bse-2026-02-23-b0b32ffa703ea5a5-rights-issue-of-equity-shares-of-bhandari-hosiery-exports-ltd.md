## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Circular Issue Date | 23 February 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

This rights issue will result in potential dilution of approximately 80% (4 shares issued per 5 held) for shareholders who do not subscribe. The ex-rights adjustment affects the trading price of the stock from 25 February 2026. Existing shareholders holding shares on the record date are entitled to subscribe to new shares at Rs. 2.56 each. The impact is limited to existing shareholders and trading members handling transactions in this scrip; broader market impact is minimal given the company's small-cap status.
