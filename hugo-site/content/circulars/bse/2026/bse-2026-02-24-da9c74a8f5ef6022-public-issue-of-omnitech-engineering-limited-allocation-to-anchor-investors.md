## Summary

BSE has issued a circular announcing the allocation of equity shares to anchor investors as part of the public issue (IPO) of OMNITECH ENGINEERING LIMITED. The circular discloses the names of anchor investors, the number of shares allocated to each, and the anchor investor allocation price, as required under SEBI's Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements (ICDR) Regulations.

## Key Points

- OMNITECH ENGINEERING LIMITED is proceeding with its public issue with anchor investor allocation completed prior to the IPO opening date.
- Anchor investor allocation is made one day before the public issue opens, in accordance with SEBI ICDR Regulations.
- The circular discloses the names of all anchor investors and the number of equity shares allocated to each.
- The anchor investor allocation price is disclosed and serves as a reference for the IPO price band.
- Anchor investors are subject to a lock-in period of 30 days from the date of allotment for a portion of shares, and 90 days for the remaining portion.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes are introduced. This circular is a standard disclosure under SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018, which mandate public disclosure of anchor investor allocations by exchanges before the public issue opening date.

## Compliance Requirements

- The company (OMNITECH ENGINEERING LIMITED) and its Book Running Lead Managers (BRLMs) are required to ensure anchor investor lock-in compliance post-allotment.
- Anchor investors must adhere to the 30-day lock-in on 50% of allocated shares and 90-day lock-in on the remaining 50%, per SEBI ICDR norms.
- BSE members and investors should note the anchor allocation price as indicative of the final issue price determination.

## Important Dates

- **Anchor Investor Allocation Date:** 2026-02-24 (one business day before IPO opening)
- **IPO Opening Date:** Approximately 2026-02-25 (next business day after anchor allocation)
- **Lock-in Period (50% of anchor shares):** 30 days from date of allotment
- **Lock-in Period (remaining 50% of anchor shares):** 90 days from date of allotment

## Impact Assessment

The anchor investor allocation for OMNITECH ENGINEERING LIMITED is a routine pre-IPO disclosure with medium significance. Successful anchor investor participation signals institutional confidence in the issue and may positively influence retail and non-institutional investor sentiment. The circular has a direct impact on the anchor investors named and an indirect informational impact on all prospective IPO applicants. No immediate trading impact is expected on the secondary market, as the shares are not yet listed.
