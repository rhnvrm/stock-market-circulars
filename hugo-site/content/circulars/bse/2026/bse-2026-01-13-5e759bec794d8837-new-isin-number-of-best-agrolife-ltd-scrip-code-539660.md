## Summary

BSE has issued a new ISIN number INE052T01021 for Best Agrolife Ltd (Scrip Code: 539660) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs.10 to Re.1. This is a continuation of the exchange notice dated January 06, 2026, and the new ISIN will be effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of January 16, 2026.

## Key Points

- Company: BEST AGROLIFE LTD (Scrip Code: 539660)
- New ISIN: INE052T01021
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Re.1/-
- Split Ratio: 10:1 (each share of Rs.10 becomes 10 shares of Re.1)
- Ex-Date: January 16, 2026
- Reference: DR-800/2025-2026
- Notice Number: 20260113-6
- Previous Notice: 20260106-25 dated January 06, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard ISIN modification process following a corporate action (stock split) as per existing BSE procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN INE052T01021 before the ex-date
- All trades executed from January 16, 2026 onwards must use the new ISIN
- Depositories (NSDL/CDSDL) will reflect the new ISIN for sub-divided shares post ex-date
- Trading members should ensure proper mapping of old and new ISIN in their trading systems

## Important Dates

- **January 06, 2026**: Initial exchange notice issued (20260106-25)
- **January 13, 2026**: Current notice with new ISIN details issued
- **January 16, 2026**: Ex-date - New ISIN becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The stock split increases liquidity by reducing the per-share price, making it more accessible to retail investors. The 10:1 split ratio is substantial.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and market participants need to ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN before the ex-date to avoid settlement failures. This is a standard operational requirement for corporate actions.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares of Re.1 face value for each share of Rs.10 face value held. Total investment value remains unchanged, but the number of shares increases tenfold. Post-split, the stock price will be approximately one-tenth of the pre-split price.
