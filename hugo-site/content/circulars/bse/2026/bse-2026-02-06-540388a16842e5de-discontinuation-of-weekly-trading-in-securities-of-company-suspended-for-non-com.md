title: Discontinuation of Weekly Trading for Non-Compliant Companies - Procal Electronics
  and Satiate Agri
---

## Summary

BSE is discontinuing the weekly Trade-for-Trade trading facility for two companies - Procal Electronics India Ltd (Scrip Code: 526009) and Satiate Agri Ltd (Scrip Code: 524546) - effective February 24, 2026. These companies were previously suspended for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations and had been allowed limited trading on the first trading day of each week in the Z group on a Trade-for-Trade basis. As the mandated six-month period has been completed, this facility will be withdrawn.

## Key Points

- Two companies affected: Procal Electronics India Ltd and Satiate Agri Ltd
- Companies were initially suspended in July 2025 for SEBI LODR non-compliance
- Weekly Trade-for-Trade facility in Z group to be discontinued
- Action follows completion of mandatory six-month period
- Based on SEBI Master Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the final phase of SEBI's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for suspension and revocation of equity shares. After six months of limited weekly trading following suspension, companies that remain non-compliant will lose even this restricted trading facility. The action is pursuant to Chapter-VII(A) on Penal Actions for Non-Compliance.

## Compliance Requirements

Market participants should note that trading in the securities of these two companies will no longer be permitted on any basis from February 24, 2026. The companies must achieve full compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations to have trading resumed.

## Important Dates

- **July 8, 2025**: Initial suspension notice issued (Exchange Notice No. 20250708-42)
- **February 6, 2026**: Discontinuation notice issued
- **February 24, 2026**: Weekly Trade-for-Trade facility discontinued (effective date)

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited as these securities were already under severe trading restrictions since July 2025, with trading permitted only once per week on a Trade-for-Trade basis in the Z group. This typically indicates minimal liquidity and investor interest. The discontinuation affects only investors holding these specific securities who were relying on the weekly trading window.
