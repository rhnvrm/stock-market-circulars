## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the new securities available for trading from February 25, 2026
- Lock-in compliance must be observed: all 10,00,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 113991901 to 114991900) are locked in until August 30, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 10,00,000 shares to the tradeable float of Balu Forge Industries Limited, though the entire allotment is under lock-in until August 30, 2026, meaning no immediate increase in free-float. Market impact is minimal as the preferential allotment was previously announced and the shares are restricted from trading during the lock-in period.
