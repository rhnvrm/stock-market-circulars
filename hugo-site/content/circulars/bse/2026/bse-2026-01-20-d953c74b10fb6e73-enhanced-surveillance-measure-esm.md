title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities List Update
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the list of securities under the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective January 21, 2026. Two new securities are being added to ESM: AuSom Enterprise Ltd and Best Agrolife Ltd. One security, Bits Ltd, will be moved to a higher ESM stage. No securities are moving to lower ESM stages or exiting the framework at this time.

## Key Points

- 2 securities newly shortlisted for ESM framework: AuSom Enterprise Ltd (509009) and Best Agrolife Ltd (539660)
- 1 security moving to higher ESM stage: Bits Ltd (526709)
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages
- No securities exiting ESM framework
- Consolidated list includes 30+ securities across ESM Stage I and Stage II
- Changes effective from January 21, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework places additional trading restrictions on securities that exhibit certain risk characteristics. Securities under ESM are subject to:

- Trade-for-Trade settlement (no intraday trading)
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Staged framework with escalating measures
- Price bands and other surveillance controls

Securities can move between stages based on compliance and risk assessment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure trade-for-trade settlement for all ESM securities
- No intraday squaring off permitted for ESM securities
- Members must inform clients about ESM status of securities
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting requirements apply
- Clients must take/give delivery of shares for all ESM trades

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 21, 2026 - New ESM classifications and stage movements take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities added to or moved within ESM framework face reduced liquidity due to trade-for-trade requirements. Intraday traders and speculators typically avoid ESM stocks, leading to lower trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in AuSom Enterprise Ltd and Best Agrolife Ltd will experience mandatory delivery-based trading only. Bits Ltd investors face stricter surveillance as the stock moves to higher ESM stage.

**Market Impact**: Limited to specific securities listed. The framework aims to protect investors by identifying and monitoring securities with unusual price movements or other risk indicators.
