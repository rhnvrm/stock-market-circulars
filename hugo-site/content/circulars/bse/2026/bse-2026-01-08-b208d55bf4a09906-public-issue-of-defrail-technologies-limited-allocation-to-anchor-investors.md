## Impact Assessment

This anchor investor allocation represents approximately 27.85% of the total public issue size (5,18,400 out of 18,60,800 shares). The successful anchor book building at Rs. 74 per share provides a pricing benchmark for the main public issue. The participation of institutional investors including foreign funds (VCC-based Longthrive Capital and Pine OAK Global Fund) and domestic funds (Sunrise Investment Trust) signals investor confidence in the company. The allocation price will serve as a floor reference, though the final issue price may be determined higher through the book building process for retail and other investors.
