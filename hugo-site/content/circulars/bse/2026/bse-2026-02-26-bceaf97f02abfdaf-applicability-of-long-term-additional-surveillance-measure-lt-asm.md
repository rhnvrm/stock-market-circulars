## Regulatory Changes

The LT-ASM (Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure) framework is applied by BSE to securities that meet certain criteria related to price movement, volume anomalies, or fundamental concerns over a longer period. Securities placed under LT-ASM are subject to enhanced margin requirements and may face trade-to-trade settlement or other trading restrictions depending on the assigned stage.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Brokers and trading members** must apply the enhanced margin requirements for newly added LT-ASM securities from February 27, 2026
- **Investors** holding or intending to trade these securities must be aware of the additional surveillance restrictions and margin obligations
- Brokers must refer to the consolidated list in Annexure III to confirm the ASM stage applicable to each security for accurate margin computation

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 27, 2026 (all changes in Part A through Part D and Annexure II)

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of **SpiceJet Ltd (Scrip Code: 500285)** is the most market-significant development in this circular given its status as a large, publicly followed airline stock. Placement under LT-ASM will increase margin requirements for traders, potentially reducing liquidity and increasing short-term volatility. The remaining seven securities are smaller-cap companies where the LT-ASM designation further constrains an already thin trading environment. No securities are exiting the framework, indicating no easing of surveillance pressure on existing LT-ASM stocks this cycle.
