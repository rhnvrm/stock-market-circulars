title: Cancellation of Record Date for Rights Issue of Steelco Gujarat Ltd (Scrip
  Code 500399)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued Notice No. 20260223-11 cancelling the record date for the Rights Issue of Steelco Gujarat Ltd (Scrip Code: 500399). The record date was originally set as February 24, 2026 per Exchange Notice No. 20260219-11 dated February 19, 2026. The company has decided to cancel this record date, and a new record date will be announced in due course.

## Key Points

- The previously announced record date of February 24, 2026 for the Rights Issue of Steelco Gujarat Ltd (Scrip Code: 500399) stands cancelled.
- This cancellation supersedes Exchange Notice No. 20260219-11 dated February 19, 2026.
- The ex-date of February 24, 2026 is also to be treated as cancelled.
- The Exchange will not give effect to the Corporate Action of Rights Issue as previously communicated.
- Steelco Gujarat Ltd will announce a new record date in due course.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This notice revokes a specific corporate action timeline previously communicated via Exchange Notice No. 20260219-11 dated February 19, 2026.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must treat the ex-date of February 24, 2026 as cancelled and update their systems accordingly.
- No corporate action for the Rights Issue of Steelco Gujarat Ltd should be processed based on the earlier notice.
- Members should await further communication from BSE regarding the new record date once announced by the company.

## Important Dates

- **February 19, 2026**: Original Exchange Notice No. 20260219-11 announcing record date.
- **February 24, 2026**: Previously announced record date and ex-date — now CANCELLED.
- **February 23, 2026**: Date of this cancellation notice (Notice No. 20260223-11).
- **TBD**: New record date to be announced by Steelco Gujarat Ltd.

## Impact Assessment

This cancellation has an immediate and significant impact on shareholders and trading members. Shareholders who had planned to hold shares ahead of the February 24, 2026 ex-date to qualify for the rights issue will need to await a new announcement. Trading members must ensure their systems reflect the cancellation of the ex-date to avoid erroneous processing of entitlements. The rights issue itself is not cancelled — only the record date — so shareholders should monitor future announcements from Steelco Gujarat Ltd for the rescheduled date.
