## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The listing involves a relatively small number of shares (1,00,000) issued through warrant conversion on a preferential basis. The lock-in period until August 31, 2026, ensures these shares cannot be traded freely in the immediate term. Impact is limited to Orient Tradelink Ltd. shareholders and does not affect broader market operations or other listed entities.
