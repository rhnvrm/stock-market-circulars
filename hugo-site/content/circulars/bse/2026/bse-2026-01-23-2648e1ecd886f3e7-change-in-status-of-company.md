The company's status will be changed from "Delisted" to "Suspended" effective January 28, 2026. As a result of this status change, the provisions of Regulation 34(1) and Regulation 34(2) of SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2021 will no longer be applicable to the company.

## Key Points

- Delisting of Nutraplus India Limited has been rescinded by Securities Appellate Tribunal order
- Scrip Code: 524764
- Company status will change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"
- SEBI Delisting Regulations 34(1) and 34(2) no longer applicable to the company
- Change affects equity segment

## Regulatory Changes

Following the tribunal order, the provisions of Regulation 34(1) and Regulation 34(2) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2021 are no longer applicable to Nutraplus India Limited. The company will now fall under suspended status regulations instead of delisting provisions.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance actions required from market participants. This is an informational notice regarding the change in company status. The company will now be subject to compliance requirements applicable to suspended securities rather than delisted securities.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 23, 2026
- **Effective Date of Status Change**: January 28, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a specific impact on Nutraplus India Limited and its shareholders. The rescission of delisting and change to suspended status means the company remains within BSE's framework but trading remains suspended. Shareholders and investors should note that while delisting has been reversed, the suspended status means the scrip is still not available for trading. The tribunal order overrides the previous delisting action, potentially opening pathways for future relisting or resolution of underlying issues that led to the original delisting.
