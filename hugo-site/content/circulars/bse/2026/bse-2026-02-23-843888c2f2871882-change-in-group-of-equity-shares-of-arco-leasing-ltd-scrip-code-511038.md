- Contact person for clarifications: Mrs. Kinjal More, Cell: +91-7304278788.

## Regulatory Changes

The scrip is being re-categorised from its current group to the 'X' group on the BSE equity segment. The 'X' group classification on BSE imposes specific trading restrictions, including potential trade-to-trade settlement requirements, meaning trades may not be eligible for intra-day netting and require compulsory delivery.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure their trading terminals and back-office systems reflect the new 'X' group classification for Scrip Code 511038 before market open on March 02, 2026.
- Members should notify clients who hold or intend to trade in Arco Leasing Ltd. shares about the change in trading conditions.
- Any open positions or pending orders should be reviewed in light of the updated group and associated settlement obligations.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 23, 2026
- **Effective Date of Group Change:** March 02, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The migration to the 'X' group primarily affects traders and investors in Arco Leasing Ltd. (Scrip Code: 511038). Under 'X' group rules, each trade typically results in a compulsory delivery obligation, eliminating the possibility of intra-day square-offs. This increases the cost and risk for short-term traders and may reduce liquidity in the scrip. Long-term investors holding shares in demat form are less directly affected but should be aware of the changed trading environment. The overall market impact is limited given the company's small-cap profile.
