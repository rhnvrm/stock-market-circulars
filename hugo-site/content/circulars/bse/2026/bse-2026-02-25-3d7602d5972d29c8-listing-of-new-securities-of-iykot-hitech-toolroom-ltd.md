## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing event with limited broader market impact. The addition of 1,94,323 equity shares increases the tradable float for Iykot Hitech Toolroom Ltd. (Scrip Code: 522245). Existing shareholders who held partly paid rights shares will now have fully paid, freely tradable equity shares. The new shares carry the same rights as existing equity shares (pari-passu), so no dilution of rights occurs. Impact is confined to existing shareholders and traders active in this scrip.
