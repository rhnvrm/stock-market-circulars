BSE has issued an update on the surveillance measure for companies with high Promoter and non-Promoter encumbrance as per Regulation 28(3) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulation 2011, effective January 12, 2026. No new securities are being added to the framework. Bedmutha Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 533270, ISIN: INE844K01012) is moving out of this framework due to its inclusion in the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT ASM) framework.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The framework affects 8 securities with continued high encumbrance levels, which may impact investor confidence and liquidity in these stocks.

**Operational Impact**: The removal of Bedmutha Industries from this framework (due to LT ASM inclusion) indicates escalation to a stricter surveillance regime, suggesting deteriorating conditions for that security.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or considering positions in the 8 remaining securities should be aware of elevated risks associated with high promoter/non-promoter encumbrance, including potential liquidity constraints and corporate governance concerns.

**Regulatory Impact**: This measure enforces SEBI's focus on protecting investor interests by highlighting companies with significant share pledging, which could pose risks during market volatility or corporate distress situations.
