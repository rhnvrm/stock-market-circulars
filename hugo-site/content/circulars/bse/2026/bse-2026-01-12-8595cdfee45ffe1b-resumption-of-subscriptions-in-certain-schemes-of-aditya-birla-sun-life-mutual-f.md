title: Resumption of Subscriptions in Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund Schemes
---

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited has announced the resumption of fresh subscriptions and switch-in applications in three international equity schemes effective January 12, 2026. The acceptance is limited to ₹1 crore per PAN per day across all subscription transactions including fresh purchases, additional purchases, and systematic transactions (SIP/STP).

## Key Points

- Fresh subscriptions/switch-ins recommenced from Monday, January 12, 2026
- Subscription limit: ₹1 crore per PAN per day across all transactions
- Limit applies to fresh purchase, additional purchase, SIP, and STP transactions
- Three schemes affected: International Equity Fund, Global Emerging Opportunities Fund, and Global Excellence Equity Fund of Fund
- AMC reserves right to modify maximum subscription amounts in future
- Notice dated January 9, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational update by the fund house modifying subscription acceptance policies for specific schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors must adhere to the ₹1 crore per PAN per day limit across all subscription types
- Distributors and platforms must implement the daily subscription caps
- All transactions (fresh, additional, SIP, STP) collectively count toward the daily limit

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 12, 2026 (Monday)
- **Notice Date**: January 9, 2026

## Affected Schemes

1. **Aditya Birla Sun Life International Equity Fund**
2. **Aditya Birla Sun Life Global Emerging Opportunities Fund**
3. **Aditya Birla Sun Life Global Excellence Equity Fund of Fund**

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Moderate positive impact for investors seeking exposure to international equities through these schemes. The ₹1 crore daily limit per PAN is sufficient for most retail investors but may require planning for larger institutional or HNI investments.

**Market Impact**: Limited direct market impact as this affects mutual fund subscriptions rather than direct equity trading. Indicates fund house is managing inflows to these international equity schemes, possibly due to previous capacity constraints or regulatory considerations.

**Operational Impact**: Distributors and investment platforms need to update their systems to enforce the daily subscription limits and track cumulative investments per PAN across transaction types.
