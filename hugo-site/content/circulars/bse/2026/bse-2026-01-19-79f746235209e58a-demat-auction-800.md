## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 82 securities with varying liquidity profiles. Large-cap stocks like Reliance, Infosys, and ITC have small quantities (1-29 shares) indicating minimal market impact. However, mid and small-cap stocks with larger quantities may experience localized price pressure during auction.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Brokers and clearing members with delivery shortfalls in these securities must participate in the auction, potentially facing penalty charges and higher acquisition costs. The wide range of securities requires operational coordination across multiple scrips.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Direct impact limited to investors/brokers who failed to deliver shares in the settlement. Indirect impact on market participants holding these securities during auction period due to potential temporary price volatility.
