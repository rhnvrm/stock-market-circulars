**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a routine operational bulletin that facilitates proper settlement of corporate actions.

**Investor Impact:** Low to medium for specific security holders. Investors must ensure they are on record as of the specified dates to receive entitled payments. Missing record dates would result in loss of payment entitlement for that period.

**Operational Impact:** Standard exchange operations. Trading members and depositories must process the record date information for client accounts to ensure proper credit of interest, redemption proceeds, or call money obligations.

**Sectoral Impact:** Covers diverse sectors including financial services (Akara Capital, Arohan Financial, Electronica Finance, Keertana Finserv), infrastructure (Kalpataru Projects, Bhanu Infrabuild), hospitality (Bamboo Hotel), media (Cyber Media), and conglomerate (Grasim Industries).
