This is a continuation of the earlier notice dated January 29, 2026, and follows the company's SME IPO listing.

## Key Points

- Scrip Code: 544686
- Current Segment: Trade for Trade (MT Group)
- New Segment: Rolling Settlement (M Group)
- Effective Date: Thursday, February 12, 2026
- Notice Reference: Continuation of Notice No. 20260129-49 dated January 29, 2026
- Contact: Mr. Anurag Jain, Tel: 022-2272 8822

## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for SHAYONA ENGINEERING LIMITED shares will change from Trade for Trade settlement (where delivery is compulsory) to Rolling settlement (standard T+2 settlement with intraday trading allowed).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the group change from MT to M Group
- Traders and investors should be aware of the new trading rules applicable under Rolling settlement
- No action required from existing shareholders; this is an operational change in trading mechanism

## Important Dates

- **January 29, 2026**: Original notice issued (Notice No. 20260129-49)
- **January 30, 2026**: Confirmation notice issued (Notice No. 20260130-1)
- **February 12, 2026**: Effective date for transfer to Rolling segment (M Group)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The shift from Trade for Trade to Rolling settlement will increase liquidity and trading flexibility for the stock. Investors will be able to conduct intraday trading, which was not permitted under the T2T segment.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure their systems are updated to reflect the new group classification. The change indicates the stock has completed its initial post-IPO stabilization period and meets criteria for normal rolling settlement trading.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for liquidity - investors will have more trading options including intraday trading, margin trading (subject to broker policies), and standard T+2 settlement instead of mandatory delivery.
