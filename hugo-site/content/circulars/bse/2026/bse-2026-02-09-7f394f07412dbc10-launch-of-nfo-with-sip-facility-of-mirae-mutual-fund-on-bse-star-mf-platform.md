## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine mutual fund NFO launch providing investors access to metal sector exposure through Fund of Funds structure investing in Nifty Metal ETF.

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium for BSE StAR MF Platform members. Members need to ensure operational readiness for NFO processing, including fund collection timelines, SIP registration authentication, and coordination with ICCL for funds settlement. Standard NFO procedures apply with specific attention to fund availability deadlines and transaction cancellation protocols.
