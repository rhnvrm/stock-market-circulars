The record date for this corporate action is January 22, 2026, and the new denomination will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Company: United Van Der Horst Ltd (Scrip Code: 522091)
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Existing Face Value: Rs. 5/- per share
- New Face Value: Re. 1/- per share
- Sub-division Ratio: 1:5 (one share of Rs. 5/- becomes five shares of Re. 1/- each)
- Record Date: January 22, 2026
- Effective Date: January 22, 2026
- Current ISIN (Rs. 5/-): INE890G01021 (will not be valid for transactions from January 22, 2026)
- New ISIN for Re. 1/- shares: To be announced separately
- Notice Number: DR-804/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action in compliance with existing regulations governing sub-division of shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that ISIN INE890G01021 (Rs. 5/- paid-up) will become invalid for exchange transactions on or after January 22, 2026
- Market participants must update their systems to reflect the new share denomination
- Trading members should await a separate notice announcing the new ISIN number for Re. 1/- paid-up shares
- Depository participants and shareholders need to ensure proper credit of sub-divided shares in demat accounts

## Important Dates

- **January 7, 2026**: Notice issued by BSE
- **January 22, 2026**: Record date for sub-division
- **January 22, 2026**: Effective date for new face value of Re. 1/-
- **January 22, 2026**: Old ISIN INE890G01021 becomes invalid for exchange transactions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The sub-division increases the number of outstanding shares by a factor of five while proportionally reducing the share price, making shares more affordable and potentially improving liquidity. This is a value-neutral action for existing shareholders.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems, depository systems, and market infrastructure will need updates to reflect the new ISIN and face value. The transition requires coordination between the company, depositories (NSDL/CDSL), and trading members.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive five shares of Re. 1/- each for every one share of Rs. 5/- held as on the record date. The total investment value remains unchanged, but the number of shares increases proportionally.
