## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The total number of shares being listed (223,646) represents a small fraction of the existing float for these companies. Employee stock option exercises are routine corporate actions that typically have negligible impact on share prices or trading volumes.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in available shares for trading across six securities, with Vardhman Special Steels seeing the largest single addition of 123,750 shares.

**Dilution Impact**: Minor dilution for existing shareholders as the share count increases, though the percentage dilution is likely less than 0.1% for most companies given their market capitalization.

**Operational Impact**: None for retail investors or general market participants. Standard update for trading systems and market surveillance infrastructure.
