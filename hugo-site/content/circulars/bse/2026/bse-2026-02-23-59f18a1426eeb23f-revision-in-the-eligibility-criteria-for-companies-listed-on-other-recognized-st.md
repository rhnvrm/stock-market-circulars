title: Revision in Eligibility Criteria for Direct Listing on BSE Main Board
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the eligibility criteria for two categories of companies seeking access to the Main Board: (1) SME companies migrating from the SME platform to the Main Board, and (2) companies already listed on other recognized stock exchanges seeking direct listing on BSE's Main Board. The revised framework sets out quantitative thresholds across paid-up capital, market capitalisation, market liquidity, operating profit, networth, net tangible assets, promoter holding, and lock-in requirements.

## Key Points

- **Paid-up Capital:** Minimum Rs. 10 crores required.
- **Market Capitalisation:** Average of 6 months — Rs. 1,000 crores for direct listing on Main Board; Rs. 100 crores for SME migration. Alternatively, companies with revenue from operations of Rs. 100 crores or more for each of the immediately preceding 3 full financial years are eligible.
- **Market Liquidity (6-month period):** At least 5% of weighted average listed equity shares traded; trading on at least 80% of trading days; minimum average daily turnover of Rs. 10 lakhs and minimum daily turnover of Rs. 5 lakhs; minimum average 50 daily trades and minimum 25 daily trades. Revenue alternative (Rs. 100 crores for 3 years) also applies.
- **Operating Profit (EBITDA):** Average of Rs. 15 crores on a restated consolidated basis over the preceding 3 years, with a minimum of Rs. 10 crores in each of those 3 years.
- **Networth:** Rs. 1 crore in each of the preceding 3 full financial years (restated, consolidated).
- **Net Tangible Assets:** At least Rs. 3 crores in each of the preceding 3 full financial years (restated, consolidated); not more than 50% held in monetary assets unless firm commitments exist to deploy the excess.
- **Promoter Holding:** Minimum 20% at the time of application; promoter group shareholding may be considered for any shortfall. Criterion not applicable for diversified holdings or companies with no identifiable promoters already listed on a recognized exchange with nationwide terminals.
- **Lock-in:** Promoter/promoter group shares locked in for 6 months from the date of listing on BSE. Lock-in does not apply to companies already listed on a recognized exchange with nationwide trading terminals meeting all other eligibility criteria.

## Regulatory Changes

The circular revises the eligibility framework consolidating both the SME migration route and the direct listing route under a unified criteria table. Key changes include:
- Introduction of a revenue-based alternative threshold (Rs. 100 crores revenue for 3 consecutive years) for market capitalisation and market liquidity requirements, providing flexibility for companies with strong revenues but lower market cap or liquidity.
- Clarification on the calculation methodology for average daily turnover and average number of daily trades — aggregates divided by total trading days (not days traded).
- Explicit carve-outs for promoter holding and lock-in requirements for companies with diversified/no-identifiable-promoter structures already listed on nationwide exchanges.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies seeking direct listing or SME migration must meet all applicable quantitative thresholds at the time of application.
- Promoters must maintain at least 20% holding at application; if using promoter group to meet the threshold, this must be documented.
- Companies with more than 50% of net tangible assets in monetary form must demonstrate firm commitments to deploy such assets in business or project.
- Post-listing lock-in of 6 months applies to promoter/promoter group shares unless the company qualifies for the carve-out.
- For name-changed companies (within last one year), at least 50% of revenue must come from the activity indicated by the new name.

## Important Dates

- Circular date: 23 February 2026.
- Effective date for application of revised criteria: not explicitly stated in the extracted content; companies should refer to the full circular for the operative date.

## Impact Assessment

This revision significantly affects companies on other regional/national exchanges considering direct listing on BSE Main Board, and SME-listed companies eyeing migration. The introduction of a revenue-based alternative (Rs. 100 crores for 3 years) for market cap and liquidity hurdles broadens eligibility for operationally strong but less-traded companies. The lock-in and promoter-holding carve-outs reduce compliance burden for widely-held companies already listed on national exchanges. Overall, the changes are likely to increase the pipeline of eligible companies for Main Board listing while maintaining financial soundness thresholds.
