The NFO subscription window will now close at 6:00 PM on February 25, 2026, instead of midnight as originally communicated in Notice No. 20260220-46 dated February 20, 2026.

## Key Points

- Revised NFO closing time: 6:00 PM on February 25, 2026 (earlier than the originally stated midnight)

- Fund: Aditya Birla Sun Life BSE Top 10 Banks ETF
- Communication received directly from Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund (AMC)
- Platform: BSE StAR MF

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational update from the AMC communicated through BSE to its members, revising the NFO subscription end time.

## Compliance Requirements

- BSE members facilitating subscriptions to the Aditya Birla Sun Life BSE Top 10 Banks ETF NFO must ensure all transactions are submitted by 6:00 PM on February 25, 2026.
- Members should inform investors of the revised deadline to avoid missed subscriptions.

## Important Dates
