- Any orders or references using old Scrip IDs may be invalid after the effective date.

## Important Dates

- **February 18, 2026**: Original notice (20260218-36) issued regarding the name change.
- **February 25, 2026**: Current notice issued with updated Scrip ID mapping.

## Impact Assessment

This change has a **medium operational impact** on trading members and institutional participants active in the BSE debt market segment. Systems relying on the old BOLT Plus Scrip IDs for Muthoottu Mini Financiers must be updated overnight before February 26, 2026. The change is purely administrative, stemming from a corporate name change to Muthoot MCRED Limited, and does not affect the underlying securities, their terms, or investor holdings. Retail investors are largely unaffected; the primary burden falls on trading member back-office and order management systems.
