## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - This revised schedule specifically affects institutional investors and market participants trading in the SME segment through the ITP platform. The adjustment maintains market continuity while accommodating statutory trading holidays.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading members and clearing members need to update their internal settlement calendars and systems to reflect the revised schedule. The skip in settlement numbering (ITP-198 to ITP-200) due to the January 15 holiday requires attention in operational planning.

**Liquidity Impact:** Low - The T+1 settlement cycle continues without disruption. The extended settlement periods around holidays (e.g., January 14 trading settling on January 16, January 23 trading settling on January 27) are standard adjustments that market participants routinely manage.

**Compliance Impact:** Low - No changes to compliance requirements or settlement procedures. Members need to ensure their operations teams are aware of the revised dates, particularly the pay-in instruction deadline of 9:50 AM.
