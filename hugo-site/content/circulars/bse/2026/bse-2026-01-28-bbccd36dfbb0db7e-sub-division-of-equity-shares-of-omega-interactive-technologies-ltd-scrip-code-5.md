  Code: 511644)'
---

## Summary

Omega Interactive Technologies Ltd (Scrip Code: 511644) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs.10/- will be sub-divided into ten equity shares with a face value of Re.1/- each. The record date for this corporate action is February 6, 2026. The existing ISIN INE113B01029 will become invalid for exchange transactions from the effective date, and a new ISIN for Re.1/- paid-up shares will be communicated separately.

## Key Points

- Sub-division ratio: 1 equity share of Rs.10/- into 10 equity shares of Re.1/- each
- Company: Omega Interactive Technologies Ltd
- Scrip Code: 511644
- Record Date: February 6, 2026
- Effective Date: February 6, 2026
- Segment: Equity - Dematerialised Securities Rolling Settlement
- Old ISIN (INE113B01029) will not be valid for transactions from February 6, 2026
- New ISIN for Re.1/- paid-up value to be announced separately

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action initiated by the company.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date of February 6, 2026 for the sub-division
- Existing ISIN INE113B01029 (Rs.10/- paid-up) will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after February 6, 2026
- Market participants must await separate notice for new ISIN number for Re.1/- paid-up shares
- Depositories and trading systems should update share capital and ISIN details accordingly

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 28, 2026
- **Record Date**: February 6, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 6, 2026 (sub-divided shares with Re.1/- face value)
- **ISIN Validity**: Old ISIN invalid for transactions from February 6, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares tenfold while reducing the face value proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors. The share price will adjust accordingly on the ex-date.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members, depositories, and shareholders need to be aware of the ISIN change. Systems must be updated to reflect the new share capital structure. The old ISIN will cease to be valid for trading from February 6, 2026, requiring coordination between market infrastructure institutions.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held as on the record date. The proportionate ownership and total investment value remain unchanged, but the number of shares and face value per share will change.
