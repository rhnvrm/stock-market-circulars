## Impact Assessment

The impact of this listing is minimal as the number of shares being issued is relatively small compared to typical equity bases. For Dalmia Bharat Limited, only 792 shares are being added, while Rishabh Instruments Limited is adding 6,019 shares. This represents negligible dilution for existing shareholders. The absence of a lock-in period means these shares can be freely traded immediately upon listing, providing liquidity to ESOP/ESOS recipients. This is a routine administrative action with no material impact on market operations or the overall trading dynamics of these securities.
