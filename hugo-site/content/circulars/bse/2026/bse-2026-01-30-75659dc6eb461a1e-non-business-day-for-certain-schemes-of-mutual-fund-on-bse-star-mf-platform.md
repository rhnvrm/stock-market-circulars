## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This affects only specific international mutual fund schemes and their transaction processing on designated days.

**Operational Impact**: Investors planning to transact in these schemes during the specified dates must adjust their investment timelines. The closures are due to holidays in the underlying international markets where these funds invest (e.g., US Presidents' Day, Chinese New Year).

**Investor Impact**: Limited to investors of the specific schemes mentioned. No impact on domestic equity or debt mutual funds not listed in the circular.
