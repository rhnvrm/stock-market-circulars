## Impact Assessment

Minimal direct market impact. These are routine surveillance-driven disclosure filings that signal BSE's monitoring of unusual price/volume activity. The companies' responses do not reveal any new material information. Investors should note that BSE surveillance flags can sometimes precede enhanced monitoring measures (such as ASM/GSM frameworks), but no such action has been announced in this circular. Both stocks — Jindal Saw Ltd. and KRN Heat Exchanger and Refrigeration Ltd. — continue normal trading under existing conditions.
