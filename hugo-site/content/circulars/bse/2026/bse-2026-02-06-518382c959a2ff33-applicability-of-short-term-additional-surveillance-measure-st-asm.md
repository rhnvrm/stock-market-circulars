## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective February 09, 2026. A total of 21 securities have been shortlisted for inclusion in the ST-ASM 5/15/30 Days framework, while 14 securities are being removed from the framework. No securities are being moved to higher or lower stage ASM within the short-term framework.

## Key Points

- 21 securities newly included in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework
- 14 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework
- Changes effective from February 09, 2026
- No securities moving to higher or lower stages within ST-ASM framework
- Some securities moving out due to inclusion in other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM)
- Includes both mainboard and SME scrips

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies additional surveillance measures to securities based on short-term price movements and volatility patterns over 5/15/30 day periods. Securities under this framework face enhanced monitoring and may have trading restrictions to curb excessive speculation.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of securities under ST-ASM framework
- Enhanced margin requirements typically apply to ST-ASM securities
- Investors should note that securities in ST-ASM may have restricted trading conditions
- Market participants must comply with any additional requirements specified for ST-ASM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 09, 2026 - Changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities entering ST-ASM framework will face enhanced surveillance and potentially higher margins, which may reduce speculative activity and trading volumes. The 21 newly included securities will experience more stringent monitoring.

**Liquidity Impact**: ST-ASM designation typically reduces liquidity as margin requirements increase and retail participation may decline. However, 14 securities exiting the framework will see relaxation of restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding securities in ST-ASM framework should be prepared for potential increased costs and reduced liquidity. Some securities marked with special indicators (NSE alignment, SME scrips, T+0 scrips) have additional considerations.
