## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact: Medium (localised)**

The demat auction affects 103 scrips but quantities are relatively modest for most counters. Key observations:

- **High-quantity scrips** such as NOVARTIS INDIA (4031), BGIL FILMS (3602), and MRC AGROTECH (3000) may see minor price pressure or volatility around auction settlement
- **Large-cap counters** like INFOSYS (74), TATA STEEL (86), L&T (228), and POWER FINANCE (279) have small quantities relative to their daily trading volumes — negligible impact expected
- **Small/micro-cap scrips** with large quantities relative to liquidity (e.g., BGIL FILMS, SSPDL, SUNDARAM MULTI PAP) may experience more pronounced short-term impact
- The auction is a routine mechanism ensuring settlement integrity; no systemic risk is indicated
- Brokers with short delivery positions in these scrips will bear close-out charges as per BSE norms
