## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 14, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The varied price bands create differentiated volatility controls across securities. The 2% band on Maruti Interior Products represents severe trading restrictions, likely indicating heightened surveillance concerns. Conversely, the 20% bands allow for greater price discovery but may signal elevated volatility expectations.

**Liquidity Considerations**: Tighter bands (2%, 5%) may reduce liquidity and widen bid-ask spreads, while wider bands (20%) could enable more active trading but increase risk exposure for market participants.

**Surveillance Context**: These revisions appear to be risk-based adjustments, with stricter controls applied to securities potentially exhibiting unusual price movements, low liquidity, or corporate governance concerns.
