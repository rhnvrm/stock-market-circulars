## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that 41,60,000 new equity shares of Eraaya Lifespaces Limited (Scrip Code: 531035, ISIN: INE432F01032) are listed and permitted to trade on the Exchange effective Monday, March 2, 2026. These shares were issued to Promoters on a preferential basis at Rs. 81/- per share (face value Re. 1/- + premium of Rs. 80/-) pursuant to the conversion of warrants.

## Key Points

- **Total new shares listed:** 41,60,000 equity shares of Re. 1/- each
- **Issue price:** Rs. 81/- per share (Re. 1/- face value + Rs. 80/- premium)
- **Allotted to:** Promoters on a preferential basis via conversion of warrants
- **Pari-passu:** New shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares
- **Effective trading date:** Monday, March 2, 2026
- **Scrip Code:** 531035 | **ISIN:** INE432F01032

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification following a preferential allotment approved under applicable SEBI regulations governing warrant conversion and preferential issue.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to permit trading in the newly listed shares from March 2, 2026 onwards.
- All 41,60,000 shares are subject to a statutory lock-in and cannot be traded until the lock-in period expires.

## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| First allotment (15,00,000 shares) | January 1, 2026 |
| Second allotment (26,60,000 shares) | January 2, 2026 |
| Effective listing / trading commencement | March 2, 2026 |
| Lock-in expiry for all 41,60,000 shares | September 10, 2027 |

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholders:** The issuance of 41,60,000 new shares results in equity dilution for existing shareholders. However, the entire allotment is locked in until September 10, 2027, meaning these shares will not enter the tradeable float immediately.

**Market:** Minimal short-term impact on liquidity or price discovery given the full lock-in. Post lock-in expiry in September 2027, the promoter holding becomes freely tradeable, which could affect supply dynamics.

**Promoter holding:** Promoter stake increases due to this preferential allotment at Rs. 81/- per share, signalling potential confidence in the company's growth trajectory.
