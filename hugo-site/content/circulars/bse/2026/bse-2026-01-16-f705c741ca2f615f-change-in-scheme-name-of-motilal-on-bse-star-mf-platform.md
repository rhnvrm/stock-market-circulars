## Summary

Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company Limited has announced a scheme name change for one of its mutual fund schemes effective January 14, 2026. The scheme formerly known as 'Motilal Oswal Gold and Silver ETFs Fund of Funds' has been renamed to 'Motilal Oswal Gold and Silver Passive Fund of Funds' to align with the category of the scheme. Additionally, the circular notifies investors that January 15, 2026 is a non-business day due to Maharashtra municipal elections, and all transactions received on that day will be processed on January 16, 2026.

## Key Points

- Scheme name changed from 'Motilal Oswal Gold and Silver ETFs Fund of Funds' to 'Motilal Oswal Gold and Silver Passive Fund of Funds'
- Change effective from January 14, 2026
- Name change done to align with the category of the scheme
- January 15, 2026 declared non-business day for all MOMF schemes due to Maharashtra municipal elections
- All transactions received on January 15, 2026 will be processed on next business day (January 16, 2026) at applicable NAV

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an administrative name change to ensure the scheme name accurately reflects its category classification.

## Compliance Requirements

Investors should note the new scheme name when making future references or transactions related to this fund. No action required from investors as this is only a name change with no impact on the scheme's investment objective, strategy, or portfolio.

## Important Dates

- **January 14, 2026**: Effective date of scheme name change
- **January 15, 2026**: Non-business day for all Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund schemes (Maharashtra municipal elections holiday)
- **January 16, 2026**: Processing date for transactions received on January 15, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Minimal impact. This is a cosmetic change to the scheme name with no effect on:
- Investment strategy or portfolio composition
- NAV calculation or pricing
- Investor holdings or rights
- Fund management or operations

The name change provides better clarity on the fund's passive investment approach. The one-day holiday may cause a minor delay in transaction processing for investors who submit requests on January 15, 2026.
