## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects 142 scrips with varying liquidity profiles. Large quantities in illiquid scrips like Spright Agro (408,383 shares) and Rajnish Wellness (50,001 shares) may see price volatility during auction.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers with pending obligations must arrange funds/securities for auction settlement. Failure to deliver triggers compulsory auction buying, potentially at unfavorable prices.

**Investor Impact**: Clients with pending delivery obligations may face higher settlement costs if auction prices exceed market rates. Notable quantities in blue-chip stocks like Reliance (465), Tata Motors (311), BHEL (100) indicate institutional delivery failures requiring resolution.
