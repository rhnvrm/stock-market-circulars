## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced in this circular. This is a standard operational notice for demat auction settlement.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members with outstanding delivery obligations in the listed securities must participate in the auction settlement
- Auction participants must settle their obligations as per BSE auction settlement procedures
- Failure to deliver securities triggers inclusion in the auction list for squared-up settlement

## Important Dates

- **Settlement Date**: January 21, 2026
- **Settlement Number**: 802

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine administrative process affecting only specific members with failed delivery obligations. Does not impact overall market operations or trading.

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium for affected brokers/members - Those with securities listed in the auction must participate in settlement and may face higher costs due to auction pricing mechanisms.

**Investor Impact**: Minimal - Individual investors are generally not directly affected unless their broker has failed delivery obligations, which may result in delayed settlement or auction buy-in at unfavorable prices.
