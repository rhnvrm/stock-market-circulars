## Summary

BSE has issued a notice prohibiting dealings in partly paid equity shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd (Scrip Code 890157) effective February 6, 2026. The restriction is imposed to facilitate the record date determination for shareholders eligible to pay the first and final call money of Rs.401.25 per share (Rs.3.75 face value + Rs.397.50 share premium).

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects only partly paid equity shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd, not fully paid shares. Limited impact on overall market liquidity.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members holding positions in partly paid shares must immediately halt trading activities for this specific scrip. Shareholders of partly paid shares need to prepare for call money payment of Rs.401.25 per share to convert to fully paid status.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders identified as of record date February 6, 2026 will be required to pay the first and final call money. No trading opportunity available from the restriction date.
