## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders as of record date January 23, 2026 will receive rights entitlements at 5:1 ratio. This represents significant dilution potential if rights are not exercised. The issue price of Rs. 35.87 includes a premium of Rs. 25.87, indicating the company is raising capital above face value.

**Trading Impact**: Stock will trade ex-rights from January 23, 2026. Theoretical ex-rights price adjustment will occur, typically resulting in price reduction proportional to the rights value. Investors purchasing shares on or after ex-rights date will not be entitled to the rights issue.

**Market Impact**: Company-specific event with limited broader market implications. Rights issues typically provide funding for business expansion or debt reduction. The 5:1 ratio indicates substantial capital raising intentions by Galaxy Agrico Exports Ltd.
