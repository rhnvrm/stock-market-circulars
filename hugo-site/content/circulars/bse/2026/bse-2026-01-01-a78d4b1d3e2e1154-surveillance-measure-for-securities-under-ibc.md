- No securities excluded from ASM framework
- Consolidated list includes 14+ securities across different IBC stages
- T+0 scrips marked with ~ are shortlisted based on parent company IBC status

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the updated surveillance status of affected securities
- Securities under IBC surveillance may have additional trading restrictions or monitoring
- Market participants should review the consolidated list (Annexure III) for complete overview of all securities under IBC framework

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 02, 2026
- **Circular Date**: January 01, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. The consolidated list continues to track securities under various stages of insolvency proceedings, providing transparency to market participants about companies under IRP.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding Neueon Towers Ltd should be aware of enhanced surveillance measures applicable from January 02, 2026. Securities under IBC surveillance typically face additional monitoring and may have trading restrictions.
