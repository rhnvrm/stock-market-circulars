title: Single Filing System Extended to Additional XBRL Events Under Regulation 30
  from February 21, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has extended the API-based single filing system (introduced via NSE/CML/2024/28 dated September 30, 2024) to cover additional XBRL events under Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015, effective February 21, 2026. Four new event categories are now included, applicable to entities listed as Only Equity or Equity+Debt.

## Key Points

- The single filing system now covers four new XBRL event types under Regulation 30 effective February 21, 2026
- Applicable to Only Equity and Equity+Debt listed companies; Exclusively Debt, REITs, and InvITs are not yet covered for the new events
- PDF filing of the newly added Regulation 30 events must **still be filed separately on both exchanges** until further notice
- Listed entities must avoid duplicate/multiple filings of the same disclosure on both exchanges for events covered under single filing
- If an exchange seeks clarification post-submission, the listed entity must respond only to that specific exchange
- For queries: BSE helpdesk 022-69158560 / 45720460 / 4570660 or bse.regulation30@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

The following four events under Regulation 30 of SEBI LODR are newly added to the single filing system (XBRL) effective **February 21, 2026**:

1. **Fraud/Default/Arrest** – Sub-para 6 of Para A, Part A, Schedule III of SEBI LODR
2. **Corporate Debt Restructuring** – Sub-paras 9 and 10 of Para A, Part A, Schedule III of SEBI LODR
3. **Resolution Plan / Restructuring (Inter-Creditors Agreement) and One-Time Settlement (OTS)** – Related to loans/borrowings from banks/financial institutions
4. **Issue Summary Document (ISD) – Buyback (Open and Tender Route)** – Per SEBI Circular on Introduction of ISD

Previously added events under the single filing system remain in effect:
- Integrated Filing-Financials (effective January 3, 2026)
- Annual Secretarial Compliance Report (effective September 15, 2025)
- Integrated Filing-Governance (effective March 1, 2025)
- Meetings of Shareholders and Voting Results (effective December 28, 2024)
- Reconciliation of Share Capital Audit Report (effective November 15, 2024)
- Investor Grievance Report (effective October 1, 2024)
- Corporate Governance Report – merged with Integrated Filing-Governance

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed entities (Only Equity and Equity+Debt) must use the single filing system for the four newly added XBRL events under Regulation 30 from February 21, 2026
- **PDF filings** for these same Regulation 30 events must continue to be submitted separately on both exchanges until further notice
- Entities must not file the same XBRL disclosure redundantly on both exchanges for covered events
- For events not yet covered under single filing, separate submissions on all exchanges remain mandatory
- Respond to clarification requests only from the exchange that raised the query

## Important Dates

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| September 30, 2024 | Original single filing system launched (NSE/CML/2024/28) |
| February 20, 2026 | BSE circular issued (Notice No. 20260220-44) |
| **February 21, 2026** | **New XBRL events (Fraud/Default, CDR, Resolution Plan, ISD-Buyback) go live under single filing** |

## Impact Assessment

This update has a **medium operational impact** on listed equity and equity+debt companies. It reduces the compliance burden for four additional Regulation 30 event types by enabling single XBRL submission across both BSE and NSE. However, since PDF filings still require dual submission for these events, the full benefit of single filing is not yet realized. Companies should update their compliance workflows to avoid duplicate XBRL submissions and ensure their teams are aware of the split obligation (single XBRL, dual PDF) for the newly added event categories. Exclusively Debt issuers, REITs, and InvITs are unaffected by this extension.
