## Summary

BSE has announced that Shentracon Chemicals Ltd (scrip code: 530757) has signed agreements with both depositories (NSDL and CDSL). Effective January 7, 2026 (Settlement No. DR-793/2025-2026), the scrip will be moved from Group P to Group XT and will be traded under trade-to-trade settlement with compulsory dematerialisation. The market lot will be revised from 100 shares to 1 share.

## Key Points

- Scrip code: 530757 - Shentracon Chemicals Ltd
- Group change: From P to XT
- Market lot revised: From 100 shares to 1 share

## Regulatory Changes

The scrip will be traded in the Trade-to-Trade (XT) segment instead of the previous Group P classification. This change is implemented for reasons other than non-signing of agreements with depositories, as the company has now completed signing agreements with both depositories.

- **Effective Date:** January 7, 2026 (Wednesday)
- **Settlement Number:** DR-793/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:**
- Reduced market lot from 100 to 1 share increases accessibility for smaller investors
- Trade-to-trade mechanism means each trade must be settled individually without netting
- Liquidity may be affected due to stricter settlement requirements

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members must ensure all client holdings are in demat form
- Increased surveillance and compliance requirements due to XT group classification
- Direct close-out of shortages increases risk for sellers who fail to deliver

**Investor Impact:**
- Lower market lot makes entry more affordable
- Mandatory demat requirement may exclude investors holding physical certificates
- No intraday position squaring possible due to trade-to-trade nature
