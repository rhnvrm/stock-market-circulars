---

## Summary

BSE has announced that pursuant to an order issued by the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal, the delisting of Nutraplus India Limited (Scrip Code: 524764) stands rescinded. The company's status will be changed from "Delisted" to "Suspended" effective January 28, 2026. As a consequence of this status change, provisions of Regulation 34(1) and Regulation 34(2) of the SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2021 are no longer applicable to the company.

## Key Points

- Securities Appellate Tribunal has ordered the rescission of Nutraplus India Limited's delisting
- Company status will change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"
- Scrip Code: 524764
- SEBI Delisting Regulations provisions (Regulation 34(1) and 34(2)) will not apply to the company
- Status change represents a reversal of previous delisting action

## Regulatory Changes

The rescission order from the Securities Appellate Tribunal nullifies the previous delisting action. Consequently, Regulation 34(1) and Regulation 34(2) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2021 are no longer applicable to Nutraplus India Limited. The company will be governed by regulations applicable to suspended securities rather than delisted securities.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements are mentioned in this circular. The change is administrative in nature, resulting from a tribunal order. Market participants should note the status change when dealing with this security.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 23, 2026
- **Effective Date of Status Change**: January 28, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to single company (Nutraplus India Limited). The status change from "Delisted" to "Suspended" indicates regulatory/judicial intervention reversing a previous delisting decision.

**Operational Impact**: The company transitions from delisted status to suspended status, which may have implications for shareholders and potential future trading, though trading remains suspended. This represents a legal/regulatory development that could be significant for existing shareholders of Nutraplus India Limited.

**Regulatory Significance**: The rescission by the Securities Appellate Tribunal demonstrates the appellate review process for delisting decisions and the possibility of reversing such actions through legal channels.
