**Investor Impact**: Shareholders will see their holdings reflected with the new ISIN post ex-date, with share quantity multiplied by 5 (due to 5:1 sub-division) and proportionate price adjustment.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers, exchanges, depositories, and custodians need to ensure seamless transition to the new ISIN to avoid settlement issues.
