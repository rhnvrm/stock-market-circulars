## Impact Assessment

The listing represents routine issuance under employee benefit schemes with minimal market impact. The largest issuance is by Indiqube Spaces Limited (1,953,646 shares), while established companies like ICICI Bank and Angel One have relatively smaller issuances. With no lock-in periods, all shares are immediately available for trading, though the volume is relatively small compared to total outstanding shares for most companies. This is a standard administrative action with low significance for market participants.
