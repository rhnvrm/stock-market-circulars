| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Date of Allotment | January 11, 2025 |

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 6,610,007 shares to Gayatri Sugars Ltd.'s equity base under ISIN INE622E01023. However, since the full allotment is subject to a lock-in until September 15, 2026, there is no immediate increase in free-float. Post lock-in expiry, the incremental supply could exert mild downward pressure depending on promoter and non-promoter selling intent. The issue price of Rs. 10 at par may be significantly below prevailing market price, which could influence sentiment around the lock-in expiry date. Overall near-term market impact is moderate; medium-term dilution effect should be monitored.
