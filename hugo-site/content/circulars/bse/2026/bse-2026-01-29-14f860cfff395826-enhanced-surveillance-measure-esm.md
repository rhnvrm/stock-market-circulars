title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities Movement Update
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective January 30, 2026. Two securities - Aptus Pharma Ltd and Rotographics (India) Ltd - will be moved to higher ESM stages. No new securities are being added to the ESM framework, and no securities are exiting the framework. The circular includes a consolidated list of all securities currently under ESM with their respective stages.

## Key Points

- No new securities shortlisted for ESM framework
- 2 securities moving to higher ESM stages: Aptus Pharma Ltd (Scrip Code: 544529, ISIN: INE15XJ01010) and Rotographics (India) Ltd (Scrip Code: 539922, ISIN: INE364S01014)
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages
- No securities exiting ESM framework
- Consolidated list contains 31+ securities across ESM Stage I and Stage II
- Changes effective from January 30, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes to the ESM framework itself. This is a routine update on securities classification within the existing framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and investors should note the higher surveillance stage for Aptus Pharma Ltd and Rotographics (India) Ltd
- Securities in higher ESM stages typically face additional trading restrictions and enhanced monitoring
- Market participants should review their positions in affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 30, 2026 - ESM stage changes come into effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited direct market impact as only 2 securities are being moved to higher surveillance stages. The ESM framework continues to monitor securities with abnormal price movements or market behavior.

**Trading Impact**: Securities moving to higher ESM stages may face increased restrictions such as reduced price bands, 100% upfront margin requirements, or trade-for-trade settlement.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding Aptus Pharma Ltd and Rotographics (India) Ltd should be aware of enhanced surveillance and potential trading restrictions that come with higher ESM stages.

## Consolidated ESM List Highlights

The circular provides a comprehensive list of securities under ESM surveillance, including:
- Stage I: Majority of listed securities (e.g., Aayush Wellness Ltd, Adcon Capital Services Ltd, Adinath Textiles Ltd)
- Stage II: Securities under stricter surveillance (e.g., Aptus Pharma Ltd, Alps Industries Ltd, Arcee Industries Ltd)
