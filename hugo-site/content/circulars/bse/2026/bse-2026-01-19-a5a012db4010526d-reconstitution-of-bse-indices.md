## Regulatory Changes

## Important Dates

- **January 19, 2026**: Notice date and announcement of reconstitution
- **January 27, 2026**: SDE file for BSE REITs and InvITs Index will begin including newly added constituents
- **February 3, 2026**: Effective date for all reconstitution changes at market open

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of ICICI Prudential AMC and Meesho to multiple large-cap and broad market indices will drive passive investment flows into these securities as index funds rebalance. Both companies are recent listings and their inclusion in major indices represents recognition of their market capitalization and liquidity.

**Index Funds Impact**: Index funds and ETFs tracking BSE Allcap, LargeCap, LargeMidCap, Financial Services, and Consumer Discretionary indices will need to purchase shares of the newly added constituents on or before the effective date.

**REITs/InvITs Segment**: The addition of Knowledge Realty Trust and Anantam Highways Trust enhances the representation of the REITs and InvITs segment in BSE indices, potentially increasing investor attention to these alternative investment vehicles.

**No Deletion Impact**: The absence of any deletions means no stocks face potential selling pressure from index-related outflows, making this a purely additive reconstitution event.
