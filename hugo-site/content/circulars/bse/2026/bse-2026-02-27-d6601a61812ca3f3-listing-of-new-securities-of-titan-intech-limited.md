## Impact Assessment

The listing represents a modest expansion of Titan Intech Limited's equity base through preferential allotment to non-promoters. The shares are subject to a lock-in until October 20, 2026, limiting near-term market liquidity impact. The issue price of Rs. 5.50 per share provides a reference point for the allotment valuation. Overall market impact is minimal as this is a company-specific capital event.
