## Summary

BSE has announced that trading in partly paid equity shares of Suraj Industries Limited (Scrip Code 890226) will be suspended from January 27, 2026. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date to determine shareholders eligible to receive the first call notice for payment on rights equity shares. Trading members are advised not to deal in these partly paid shares.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies only to partly paid equity shares (Scrip Code 890226)
- Record date set for January 27, 2026
- First call amount: Rs. 10 per share (Rs. 2.50 face value + Rs. 7.50 securities premium)
- Settlement number: DR-806/2025-2026
- Notice issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action procedure for rights issue call payments.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealings in partly paid equity shares of Suraj Industries Limited from January 27, 2026
- Trading members are required to note this suspension and ensure compliance
- Shareholders holding partly paid equity shares must prepare for first call payment notice

## Important Dates

- **January 22, 2026**: Circular notice date
- **January 27, 2026**: Record date and no dealings commencement date
- **Settlement Number**: DR-806/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of partly paid equity shares of Suraj Industries Limited. No impact on fully paid shares or broader market operations.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update systems to block dealings in the specified scrip code. Shareholders of partly paid shares need to arrange funds for the first call payment of Rs. 10 per share.

**Investor Impact**: Existing holders of partly paid shares cannot trade these securities from the record date and must respond to the forthcoming call notice for payment to maintain their shareholding.
