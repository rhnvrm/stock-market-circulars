## Regulatory Changes

Price band restrictions limit the maximum percentage by which a stock's price can move up or down in a single trading day. These revised bands represent enhanced surveillance measures to control volatility in these specific securities.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 2, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 3, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The tightened price bands indicate these securities are under enhanced surveillance, likely due to unusual price movements or volatility concerns. Traders and investors in these securities will experience reduced intraday price movement flexibility. The 2% band on Mukat Pipes is particularly restrictive, suggesting heightened surveillance concerns for this security.
