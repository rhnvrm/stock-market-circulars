## Summary

BSE has announced a trading holiday on January 15, 2026 for Currency Derivatives Segment (including Currency Derivatives and Interest Rate Derivatives products), New Debt Segment - Reporting, Settlement and Trading (NDS-RST), and Tri Party Repo segments. This closure is in view of the Municipal Corporation Elections scheduled in Maharashtra on that day. This notice partially modifies the earlier trading holiday calendar for 2026 issued on December 23, 2025.

## Key Points

- Exchange will remain closed on Thursday, January 15, 2026
- No trading will occur in Currency Derivatives Segment (Currency Derivatives products and Interest Rate Derivatives products)
- No trading in NDS-RST segment
- No trading in Tri Party Repo segment
- Closure due to Municipal Corporation Election in Maharashtra
- Partial modification to Exchange notice 20251223-12 dated December 23, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

This notice modifies the previously announced trading holiday calendar for 2026. The addition of January 15, 2026 as a trading holiday was necessitated by the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Elections, which were not accounted for in the original calendar issued in December 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that no trading activity will be permitted on January 15, 2026 in the affected segments
- Members should adjust their trading schedules and inform their clients accordingly
- No positions can be opened or closed on this date in Currency Derivatives, Interest Rate Derivatives, NDS-RST, or Tri Party Repo segments

## Important Dates

- **January 15, 2026**: Trading holiday for Currency Derivatives Segment (Currency Derivatives and Interest Rate Derivatives products), NDS-RST, and Tri Party Repo segments
- **Reference Notice**: Exchange notice 20251223-12 dated December 23, 2025 (original trading holiday calendar)

## Impact Assessment

The trading holiday impacts all participants in the Currency Derivatives market, Interest Rate Derivatives market, NDS-RST segment, and Tri Party Repo segment. Market participants should:

- Plan their hedging and trading strategies accounting for the market closure
- Adjust settlement schedules for trades executed before and after the holiday
- Ensure adequate risk management considering the one-day market closure
- Note that this is a segment-specific holiday and may not apply to other BSE trading segments
- Consider potential volatility on resumption of trading on January 16, 2026
