(Scrip Code: 500051) will be reclassified and included under the 'X' group effective March 05, 2026. The 'X' group on BSE denotes trade-to-trade (T2T) settlement, which eliminates intraday squaring off and requires mandatory delivery for all transactions.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

The equity shares of Bhagawati Gas Ltd. are being reclassified from their current trading group to the 'X' group on BSE. The 'X' group (Trade-to-Trade segment) is typically applied to securities under enhanced surveillance or those flagged for compliance-related concerns. This change modifies the settlement mechanism applicable to trades in the scrip.

## Impact Assessment

The move to the 'X' group (Trade-to-Trade) has a moderate impact on market participants trading in Bhagawati Gas Ltd. (500051). Key implications include: (1) elimination of intraday trading, increasing capital requirements for traders; (2) potential reduction in liquidity and trading volumes as speculative activity is curtailed; (3) existing short-term traders and those using margin-based intraday strategies will need to close or convert positions before the effective date. Long-term investors holding delivery-based positions are less directly affected by this reclassification.
