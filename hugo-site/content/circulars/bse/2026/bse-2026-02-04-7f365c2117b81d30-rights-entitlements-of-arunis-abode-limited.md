## Important Dates

- **February 11, 2026**: Rights Entitlements trading for renunciation ends
- **February 16, 2026**: Rights Issue closes
- **Settlement**: T+1 basis for all trades

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact (Medium):** Shareholders of ARUNIS ABODE LIMITED have a narrow 3-day window (Feb 9-11) to trade their rights entitlements if they wish to renounce. Investors must act quickly to either subscribe to the rights issue (until Feb 16) or sell their entitlements in the market. Failure to take action will result in lapse of entitlements with no value recovery.

**Market Impact (Low to Medium):** Limited trading window may create concentrated trading activity in the rights entitlements. Trade-for-trade settlement on T+1 basis ensures delivery-based transactions only. The dematerialization requirement ensures proper tracking and reduces settlement risk.
