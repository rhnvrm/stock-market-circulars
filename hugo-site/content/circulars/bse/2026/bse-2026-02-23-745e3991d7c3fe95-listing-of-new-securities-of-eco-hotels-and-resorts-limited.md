## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that 10,30,145 new equity shares of ECO Hotels and Resorts Limited (Scrip Code: 514402, ISIN: INE638N01012) are listed and permitted to trade on the Exchange with effect from Tuesday, February 24, 2026. The shares were issued on a preferential basis to non-promoters at an issue price of Rs. 34.50/- per share (face value Rs. 10/- + premium of Rs. 24.50/-).

## Key Points

- 10,30,145 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each issued at a premium of Rs. 24.50/- (total issue price Rs. 34.50/-) to non-promoters on a preferential basis
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares of the company
- Distribution numbers: 64627944 to 65658088
- Date of allotment: July 22, 2025
- ISIN: INE638N01012
- All 10,30,145 shares are subject to lock-in until August 25, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification pursuant to a completed preferential allotment.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members should note the lock-in restriction on the newly listed shares. The 10,30,145 shares (Dist. Nos. 64627944 to 65658088) are locked in until August 25, 2026 and cannot be traded until that date.

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** July 22, 2025
- **Trading Commencement:** February 24, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry:** August 25, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing of approximately 10.30 lakh new shares on a preferential basis to non-promoters results in a minor dilution of existing shareholding. The shares carry a lock-in period extending to August 25, 2026, meaning they will not be available for trading in the near term. Overall market impact is minimal given the small quantity and lock-in constraint.
