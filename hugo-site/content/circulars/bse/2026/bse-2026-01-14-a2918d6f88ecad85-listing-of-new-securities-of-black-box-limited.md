## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a relatively small preferential issue affecting a single company. The addition of 1.28 lakh shares represents dilution for existing shareholders but is routine corporate action.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and distinctive number ranges. The lock-in restriction limits immediate trading activity for these specific shares.

**Investor Impact**: Moderate for BLACK BOX LIMITED shareholders due to equity dilution from warrant conversion. Non-promoter investors who received the allotment cannot trade these shares until the lock-in expires in July 2026.
