title: Revision in Reference Price for Price Bands for Gold and Silver ETFs - Update
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update notice (20260201-3) revising the reference price for price bands applicable to Gold and Silver Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). This revision follows and modifies the earlier notice 20260201-01 dated February 1, 2026. The changes are applicable for the trading session on February 1, 2026 only.

## Key Points

- Update to earlier Notice No 20260201-01 dated February 1, 2026
- Revised reference prices for price bands on Gold and Silver ETFs
- Changes applicable only for February 1, 2026 trading session
- Issued by Ketan Jantre, Head - Trading Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a one-day operational adjustment to reference prices for Gold and Silver ETF price bands.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note the updated reference prices for price bands when trading Gold and Silver ETFs on February 1, 2026.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 1, 2026
- **Applicable Date**: February 1, 2026 (today only)

## Impact Assessment

Limited impact restricted to single trading day. Trading members dealing in Gold and Silver ETFs need to adjust their systems and trading strategies based on the revised reference prices for price bands. The one-day nature of this revision suggests it may be related to significant commodity price movements requiring intraday adjustment to prevent excessive volatility or circuit breaker triggers.
