## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 7.81 crore shares represents substantial dilution of existing equity. However, immediate market impact is limited due to the lock-in period extending until July 22, 2026, preventing these shares from being traded for approximately six months.

**Operational Impact**: The preferential allotment to non-promoters at Rs. 5.62 per share indicates capital raising activity. The lock-in period provides stability by preventing immediate sell-off pressure. Trading members should update their records to reflect the expanded share capital and lock-in restrictions.
