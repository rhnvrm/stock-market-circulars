## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The migration from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment typically increases liquidity and trading flexibility for the stock. Trade for Trade segments are restrictive and require full upfront payment/delivery, while Rolling settlement allows standard market practices with T+1 settlement cycles.

**Operational Impact:** Trading Members need to update their systems to reflect the group change. The company's shares will become more accessible to regular market participants who prefer Rolling segment stocks over restrictive Trade for Trade stocks.

**Investor Impact:** Investors will experience improved liquidity and easier entry/exit from positions. The move suggests the company has completed its initial stabilization period post-IPO and is ready for normal market trading conditions.
