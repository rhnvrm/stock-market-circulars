title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Framework effective February 02, 2026. Six securities are being newly included in the ST-ASM framework, three securities are exiting the framework, and one security (Vivimed Labs Ltd) will move to a higher stage ASM while remaining in the framework. The consolidated list shows 16 securities currently under various stages of ST-ASM surveillance.

## Key Points

- 6 securities newly shortlisted for ST-ASM Framework: Deep Diamond India Ltd, IB Infotech Enterprises Ltd, Integra Essentia Ltd, Manorama Industries Ltd, Systematix Corporate Services Ltd, and YAJUR FIBRES LIMITED
- 1 security moving to higher stage: Vivimed Labs Ltd
- 3 securities exiting ST-ASM Framework: Mirc Electronics Ltd, Orient Technologies Ltd, and Sofcom Systems Ltd
- Total of 16 securities in consolidated ST-ASM list
- Framework includes both mainboard and SME scrips
- Effective date: February 02, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM Framework operates on 5/15/30 days basis with staged surveillance measures. Securities can move between different ASM stages (I, II, etc.) based on their trading patterns and volatility. The framework aims to curb excessive speculation and protect investor interests by imposing additional surveillance on securities showing unusual price movements or volatility.

## Compliance Requirements

Investors and market participants should:
- Note the enhanced surveillance applicable to listed securities
- Be aware that ST-ASM securities may have additional margin requirements and trading restrictions
- Monitor securities marked with special indicators: @ for SME scrips, ~ for T+0 scrips, * for securities as per NSE
- Understand that securities may move between stages or exit based on market behavior

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 02, 2026 - All changes to ST-ASM framework take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The changes affect 10 securities with varying levels of surveillance. Securities entering ST-ASM may experience reduced liquidity and higher trading costs due to enhanced margin requirements.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of stricter surveillance measures, potential additional margins, and possible trading restrictions. The exit of 3 securities from the framework may improve their trading conditions.

**Operational Impact**: The inclusion of both mainboard and SME securities indicates BSE's comprehensive approach to market surveillance across all segments.
