## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised price bands for the 22 listed scrips and update their trading systems accordingly before March 02, 2026
- Orders placed outside the revised price band limits will be rejected by the exchange system
- Members should communicate these changes to their clients who trade in the affected scrips

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 27, 2026
- **Effective Date:** March 02, 2026 (price band revision takes effect)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine surveillance measure by BSE to control price volatility in select small-cap and micro-cap securities. Scrips assigned a tighter 5% band may indicate heightened regulatory scrutiny, potentially restricting speculative activity. Scrips moved to a wider 20% band may reflect greater liquidity or reduced surveillance concern. Trading members and retail investors in these 22 scrips should expect modified daily circuit limits from March 02, 2026 onwards, which will affect intraday price movement limits and potentially impact trading strategies.
