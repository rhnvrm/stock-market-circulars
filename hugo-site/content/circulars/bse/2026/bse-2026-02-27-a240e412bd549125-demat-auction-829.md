## Impact Assessment

This is a routine demat auction notice with low systemic market impact. It signals short delivery failures across a broad range of scrips in settlement 829. The most notable entry is SpiceJet (372,400 shares), which may reflect ongoing liquidity or delivery concerns for that scrip. For most other scrips the quantities are small and represent isolated delivery failures. Participants holding positions in listed scrips should monitor auction outcomes as prices in auction may differ from market prices, potentially affecting their net settlement obligations.
