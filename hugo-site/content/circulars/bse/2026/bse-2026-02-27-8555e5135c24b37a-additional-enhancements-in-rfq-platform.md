title: BSE Implements Additional Enhancements to RFQ Platform for Debt Segment
---

## Summary

BSE has announced additional enhancements to its Request for Quote (RFQ) platform for the debt segment, effective March 02, 2026. These improvements follow the earlier notice 20251017-27 dated October 17, 2025 and are implemented in accordance with SEBI directions to improve user experience and market efficiency.

## Key Points

- Enhancements are effective from **March 02, 2026**
- Four new features have been added to the RFQ platform
- Changes apply to all market participants operating in the debt segment
- Builds upon previous enhancements notified on October 17, 2025 (Notice 20251017-27)
- Contact for queries: fixedIncome@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

These enhancements are implemented pursuant to SEBI directions to improve transparency and usability on the RFQ platform. No new regulatory obligations are imposed; the changes are platform-side improvements.

## New Features

1. **Enhanced Market Watch Screen**: Upgraded to display additional security details including Credit Rating, Type of Yield (YTM / YTC / YTP), and Maturity / Put / Call dates.

2. **Customized Market Watch**: Participants can create personalized market views using advanced filters — Issuer, Sector, Instrument Type, Maturity Buckets, Odd Lots / Market Lots, Value, and ISIN — enabling more efficient analysis and comparison of bids/offers.

3. **Broad Clubbed Quoting Facility**: A new quoting functionality allowing participants to place clubbed bids/offers across securities grouped by Issuer, Rating, and Maturity Buckets, simplifying execution for participants dealing in multiple securities of similar profiles.

4. **Display of Additional Security Information**: The RFQ platform will now display key parameters including Maturity Date, Cash Flow Details, Credit Rating, and Sector Information.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance action is required from market participants. Participants are advised to familiarise themselves with the new features and updated interface before the effective date of March 02, 2026.

## Important Dates

- **February 27, 2026**: Notice issued (Notice No. 20260227-30)
- **March 02, 2026**: All enhancements become effective

## Impact Assessment

These enhancements are operationally beneficial for debt market participants, particularly institutional investors and fixed income traders. The Broad Clubbed Quoting Facility reduces execution complexity for multi-security portfolios. Improved Market Watch screens with credit rating and yield type information enhance price discovery and decision-making. Overall market impact is moderate and positive — improving transparency and efficiency in the debt segment without imposing new compliance burdens.
