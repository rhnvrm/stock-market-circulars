## Impact Assessment

**Investors:** Provides opportunity for investors holding old physical securities to get rightful access to their securities through transfer and dematerialisation. Particularly beneficial for those whose earlier transfer requests were rejected due to documentation issues.

**Market Participants:** RTAs and listed companies need to establish processes for handling these special window requests, including enhanced verification procedures for identity and signatures.

**Market Infrastructure:** Promotes the transition from physical to demat holdings, improving market efficiency and reducing risks associated with physical certificates.

**Limitations:** The one-year lock-in period restricts immediate liquidity of transferred securities. Dispute cases and IEPF securities remain outside the scope of this facility.
