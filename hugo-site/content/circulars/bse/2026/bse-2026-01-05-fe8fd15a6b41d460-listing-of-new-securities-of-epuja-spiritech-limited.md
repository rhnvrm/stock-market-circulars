## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notice with minimal market impact. The listing of 23.67 lakh equity shares increases the total issued capital of EPUJA SPIRITECH LIMITED. The lock-in period until July 9, 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure. As these shares were issued through warrant conversion on a preferential basis to Non-Promoters, it represents capital raising activity completed in mid-2025. The pari-passu nature ensures equal rights with existing shareholders. Impact is limited to this specific scrip with no broader market implications.
