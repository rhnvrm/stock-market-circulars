## Summary

BSE has listed 41,60,000 new equity shares of Eraaya Lifespaces Limited (Scrip Code: 531035) arising from a preferential allotment to promoters through conversion of warrants. These shares are permitted to trade on the Exchange with effect from Monday, March 2, 2026. The shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares of the company.

## Key Points

- 41,60,000 equity shares of Re. 1/- each issued at a premium of Rs. 80/- (issue price Rs. 81/-) to promoters on a preferential basis
- Shares issued via conversion of warrants
- New shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares
- ISIN: INE432F01032
- Trading permitted from March 2, 2026
- Two tranches of allotment: 15,00,000 shares on 01/01/2026 and 26,60,000 shares on 02/01/2026
- All 41,60,000 shares subject to lock-in until September 10, 2027

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification pursuant to a preferential allotment approved under applicable SEBI and Companies Act regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed that the new securities are listed and may be traded from March 2, 2026
- Lock-in restriction applies to all 41,60,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 199334161 to 203494160) until September 10, 2027; these cannot be traded during the lock-in period

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment (Tranche 1):** January 1, 2026 — 15,00,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 199334161 to 200834160)
- **Date of Allotment (Tranche 2):** January 2, 2026 — 26,60,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 200834161 to 203494160)
- **Trading Commencement:** March 2, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry:** September 10, 2027

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 41,60,000 shares to Eraaya Lifespaces Limited's equity base at an issue price of Rs. 81/- per share, implying a total preferential allotment value of approximately Rs. 33.7 crore. Since all newly listed shares are locked in until September 10, 2027, there is no immediate increase in free-float or trading liquidity. Market impact is expected to be minimal in the short term. The warrant conversion signals promoter confidence but does not directly affect retail investors until the lock-in period expires.
