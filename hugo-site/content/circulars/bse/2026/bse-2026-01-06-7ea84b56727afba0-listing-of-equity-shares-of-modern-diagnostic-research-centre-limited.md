## Compliance Requirements

- All listed securities must remain in dematerialized form
- Lock-in restrictions must be observed until respective expiry dates
- Trading in locked-in securities is prohibited until lock-in period expires

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The listing adds 15.1 million shares to the market, though liquidity will be limited initially due to lock-in periods. Gradual unlock starting February 2026 will progressively increase tradable float over a 3-year period.

**Operational Impact**: The staggered lock-in structure suggests a controlled release mechanism, potentially from promoters, pre-IPO investors, or a combination thereof. The majority of shares (12.24 million) are locked until 2027-2029, limiting immediate trading activity.
