## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine debt market operational circular facilitating retail and institutional participation in SDL auctions through the non-competitive route.

**Participant Impact:** The circular provides debt market participants access to state government securities across multiple maturities (2032-2056), offering investment opportunities in debt instruments from fiscally diverse states. The non-competitive bidding facility simplifies participation for investors who may not want to engage in competitive price discovery.

**Securities Covered:**
- **Assam:** AS SDL 2046 (Rs. 1,000 Cr, New)
- **Jammu & Kashmir:** JK SDL 2041 (Rs. 500 Cr, New)
- **Karnataka:** 7.25% KA 2032 (Rs. 2,000 Cr, Re-issue), KA SDL 2034 (Rs. 2,000 Cr, New), KA SDL 2038 (Rs. 2,000 Cr, New)
- **Odisha:** OR SDL 2036 (Rs. 500 Cr, New), OR SDL 2046 (Rs. 500 Cr, New)
- **Tamil Nadu:** TN SDL 2032 (Rs. 1,000 Cr, New), TN SDL 2033 (Rs. 1,000 Cr, New), TN SDL 2056 (Rs. 2,000 Cr, New)
- **Uttarakhand:** UK SDL 2035 (Rs. 500 Cr, New)

Karnataka accounts for the largest portion with Rs. 6,000 crores across three securities.
