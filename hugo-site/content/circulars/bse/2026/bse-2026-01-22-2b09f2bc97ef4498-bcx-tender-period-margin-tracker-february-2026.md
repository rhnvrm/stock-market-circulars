## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects liquidity and position management for commodity futures traders approaching expiry. Traders holding positions into tender period need to plan for increased margin requirements.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and clearing members must ensure systems are configured to collect escalating margins as per the published schedule. Clients holding delivery-intended positions must maintain adequate collateral.

**Financial Impact:** Increased margin requirements reduce available leverage and may require additional capital deployment for position holders during tender period. Progressive margin escalation provides advance notice for capital planning.
