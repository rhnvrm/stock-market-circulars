## Impact Assessment

This OFS represents a significant secondary market offering of 75 lakh shares in Andhra Cements Ltd. The structured two-day bidding process ensures fair access across investor categories with institutional investors bidding on Day 1 and retail/employee investors on Day 2. The 10% retail reservation with discount eligibility provides preferential terms for smaller investors. The price priority allocation method favors higher bid prices, potentially driving price discovery above the Rs 72 floor price. Market participants should prepare adequate margin and access bidding platforms during specified windows.
