## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

The ISIN number for A-1 Ltd's equity shares has been changed from the previous identifier to INE911Z01025 to reflect the new face value of Re.1/- per share following the sub-division. The old ISIN represented shares with a face value of Rs.10/- each.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The ISIN change affects all trading and settlement activities for A-1 Ltd shares. Trading members must update their systems to avoid settlement failures.

**Operational Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their holdings automatically adjusted with the new ISIN and face value in demat accounts. The number of shares will increase proportionally (10:1 ratio) while the total investment value remains unchanged.

**Trading Impact**: One-day transition where market participants must ensure they are using the correct ISIN for trades executed on or after the ex-date. Any pending orders may need to be revised.
