## Compliance Requirements

- The entire allotment of 13,72,500 shares is subject to a lock-in period and cannot be freely traded until after October 10, 2026.

## Impact Assessment

The listing increases Godawari Power and Ispat Ltd.'s tradable equity base by 13,72,500 shares, representing a modest dilution for existing shareholders. Since these shares are issued to Non-Promoters via warrant conversion, this signals prior fund-raising activity. The lock-in until October 10, 2026 limits immediate secondary market supply from this tranche. Market impact is expected to be low to moderate given the lock-in restriction. Existing shareholders should note the slight dilution effect on earnings per share.
