## Summary

BSE has issued Notice No. 20260224-16 informing trading members that Aarnav Fashions Limited (Scrip Code: 539562) will undergo a group change from Group X to Group B, effective February 25, 2026. This reclassification reflects a change in the company's trading category on the BSE equity segment.

## Key Points

- Aarnav Fashions Limited (Scrip Code: 539562) is being moved from Group X to Group B
- The change is effective February 25, 2026
- The notice was issued on February 24, 2026
- Applicable to the Equity segment of BSE
- Issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance & Operations

## Regulatory Changes

The company's scrip is being reclassified from Group X (a trade-to-trade settlement group typically used for securities under enhanced surveillance or non-compliant companies) to Group B (a standard trading group for smaller listed companies). This change affects how the scrip is traded and settled on the exchange.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems and records to reflect the new group classification for Aarnav Fashions Limited (Scrip Code: 539562) effective February 25, 2026
- No specific action required from investors beyond awareness of the changed trading group

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 24, 2026
- **Effective Date of Group Change:** February 25, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The move from Group X to Group B is generally a positive development for Aarnav Fashions Limited, as Group X typically carries trade-to-trade settlement restrictions and heightened surveillance. The reclassification to Group B allows for normal rolling settlement and may improve liquidity and tradability of the scrip. The broader market impact is minimal as this affects only one small-cap company.
