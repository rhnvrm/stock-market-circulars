## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

The LT-ASM framework is a surveillance mechanism introduced by BSE (in coordination with NSE) to address securities exhibiting abnormal price and/or volume behaviour over a longer time horizon. Securities placed under LT-ASM are subject to enhanced margin requirements and may face trade-to-trade (T2T) settlement obligations depending on the ASM stage assigned. This circular operationalises the next review cycle of the framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Brokers and Trading Members**: Must apply applicable margin and settlement restrictions for the 8 newly added securities from February 27, 2026 onwards
- **Investors**: Should be aware that trading in these securities will be subject to enhanced surveillance conditions, which may include higher margins and T2T settlement
- **Companies**: No direct compliance action required by the listed companies themselves, but the addition signals regulatory concern over price/volume patterns

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: February 26, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 27, 2026 — all new LT-ASM shortlistings and any stage movements take effect

## Impact Assessment

The addition of SpiceJet Ltd to the LT-ASM framework is the most market-significant element of this circular, given its status as a widely tracked mid-cap airline stock with high retail investor participation. Enhanced surveillance may reduce liquidity and increase transaction costs for retail and institutional traders in the scrip. The other seven securities are smaller-cap or less liquid companies where the practical trading impact may be more limited. The fact that no securities are exiting the LT-ASM framework in this review cycle suggests continued regulatory caution across the monitored universe.
