---

## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Ltd has announced a split in units of LIC MF GOLD ETF (Scrip Code: 533719, ISIN: INF397L01554). The face value of each unit will change from Rs. 100 to Re. 1, with a record date of March 6, 2026. Trading with the new face value will commence from March 6, 2026 under settlement DR-834/2025-2026.

## Key Points

- LIC MF GOLD ETF (Scrip Code: 533719) units will undergo a face value split from Rs. 100 to Re. 1 per unit
- Existing ISIN: INF397L01554; a new ISIN will be communicated via a separate notice
- Record date for the change in face value: March 6, 2026
- Ex-date: March 6, 2026 (Settlement No. DR-834/2025-2026)
- The ETF will be traded with the new face value effective March 6, 2026
- Notice issued by Marian Dsouza, Senior Manager – Listing Compliance and Operations, BSE

## Regulatory Changes

The face value of LIC MF GOLD ETF units is being reduced from Rs. 100 to Re. 1 per unit as part of a unit split corporate action. A new ISIN will replace the existing ISIN (INF397L01554) post-split and will be notified separately.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new face value of Re. 1 effective March 6, 2026
- Members should await the separate notice from BSE announcing the new ISIN for the split units
- Depository participants and clearing members should process the unit split for all eligible unitholders as of the record date

## Important Dates

- **Record Date:** March 6, 2026
- **Ex-Date:** March 6, 2026
- **Effective Date for New Face Value Trading:** March 6, 2026 (Settlement No. DR-834/2025-2026)
- **Circular Date:** February 25, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The unit split will proportionally increase the number of units held by existing investors (100x increase) while reducing the face value from Rs. 100 to Re. 1. This makes LIC MF GOLD ETF units more affordable for retail investors and improves liquidity on the exchange. The market price per unit will adjust proportionally post-split. Investors holding units as of the record date (March 6, 2026) will receive the split units automatically. A new ISIN will be issued, requiring system updates by brokers, depositories, and trading platforms.
