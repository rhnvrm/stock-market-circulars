These shares were issued to promoters on a preferential basis at Rs. 425 per share (face value Rs. 10 with premium of Rs. 415) pursuant to conversion of warrants. The shares are subject to lock-in until August 30, 2027.

## Key Points

- 1,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each listed
- Issued to promoters on preferential basis through warrant conversion
- Issue price: Rs. 425 per share (Rs. 10 face value + Rs. 415 premium)
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares
- ISIN: INE338F01015
- Distinctive Numbers: 51437859 to 51537858
- Date of Allotment: December 6, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced by this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members should note the listing of these new securities for trading purposes. The newly listed shares are subject to lock-in restrictions and cannot be transferred until the specified lock-in expiry date.

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: December 6, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: January 23, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry**: August 30, 2027

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. This is a routine preferential allotment to promoters through warrant conversion. The relatively small number of shares (1,00,000) and the lock-in period until August 2027 means these shares will not be available for trading in the near term. The shares rank equally with existing equity shares of Kilburn Engineering Ltd.
