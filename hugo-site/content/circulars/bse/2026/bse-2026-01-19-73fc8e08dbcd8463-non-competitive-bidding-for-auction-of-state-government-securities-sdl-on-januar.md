## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact (Medium):**

The non-competitive bidding facility enables smaller investors and trading members to participate in government securities auctions without competing on yield, democratizing access to state government debt instruments.

**Operational Impact (Medium):**
Trading members need to coordinate bid submissions within tight timelines. The 24-hour bid collection window starting January 19, 2026 at 10:00 AM provides adequate time, but members must ensure bids are submitted by 8:00 AM on auction day (January 20, 2026).

**State-wise Allocation:**
- Karnataka: Rs. 6,000 crores (46% of total) - highest allocation
- Tamil Nadu: Rs. 4,000 crores (31% of total)
- Assam: Rs. 1,000 crores
- Jammu & Kashmir: Rs. 500 crores
- Odisha: Rs. 1,000 crores
- Uttarakhand: Rs. 500 crores

**Maturity Profile:**
Securities span maturities from 6 years (2032) to 30 years (2056), offering diverse investment options for different risk-return profiles.
