**Operational Impact**: Members and custodians handling Fairchem Organics shares must ensure compliance with early pay-in requirements and coordinate timing with the BSE OTB platform bidding and confirmation windows. The automatic earmarking/blocking of securities in depository systems simplifies the process by eliminating the need for EPN file uploads.

**Liquidity Impact**: Temporary reduction in tradable float for Fairchem Organics during the buyback period as shares are earmarked for the acquisition window.
