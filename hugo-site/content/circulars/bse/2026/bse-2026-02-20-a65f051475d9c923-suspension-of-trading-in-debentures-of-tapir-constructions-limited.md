## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that Tapir Constructions Limited has fixed a Record Date of February 25, 2026 for early redemption of its Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs). Trading members are instructed to refrain from dealing in the specified debenture from that date onwards.

## Key Points

- Tapir Constructions Limited has set February 25, 2026 as the Record Date for early redemption of its NCDs.
- The affected debenture is: TCL-13.50%-18-1-27-PVT, ISIN INE00DJ07045 (Scrip Code: 975331).
- Trading members must not deal in these debentures with effect from February 25, 2026.
- The notice is issued under reference DR-828/2025-2026.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This is a standard operational notice under existing BSE listing compliance procedures for debt securities undergoing early redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- All trading members of BSE must cease trading in the debenture TCL-13.50%-18-1-27-PVT (ISIN: INE00DJ07045, Scrip Code: 975331) from February 25, 2026.
- Members must ensure no buy or sell orders are placed or executed in the said debenture on or after the no-dealings date.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 20, 2026
- **Record Date for Early Redemption:** February 25, 2026
- **No Dealings From:** February 25, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The suspension affects only one specific NCD instrument of Tapir Constructions Limited. Existing holders of the debenture (ISIN: INE00DJ07045) will have their securities redeemed early, and secondary market trading will be halted from the record date. The broader market impact is minimal given the niche nature of the instrument. Members holding or facilitating trades in this debenture must update their systems accordingly before February 25, 2026.
