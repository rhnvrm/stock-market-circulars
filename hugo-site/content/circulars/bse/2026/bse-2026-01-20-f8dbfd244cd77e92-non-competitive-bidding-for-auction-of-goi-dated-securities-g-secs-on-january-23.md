## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Provides liquidity avenue for debt market participants to invest in government securities totaling Rs. 33,000 crores. The non-competitive bidding route enables smaller investors and trading members to participate in G-sec auctions without competing on yields.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members using the NCB-GSec facility need to ensure timely bid submissions before the January 23, 2026 8:00 AM deadline. Direct investors have an earlier cutoff of January 22, 2026 at 5:00 PM. Members should coordinate with BSE Trading Operations and ICCL for any queries related to bidding, user access, or settlement obligations.

**Participant Impact**: The auction covers three different maturity profiles (2029, 2033, and 2055), offering investment options across short, medium, and long-term horizons for debt portfolio diversification.
