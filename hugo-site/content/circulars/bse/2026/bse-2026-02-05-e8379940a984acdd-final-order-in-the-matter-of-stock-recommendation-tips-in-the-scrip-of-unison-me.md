The scheme resulted in illegal profits of ₹4,29,80,725.70.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - This enforcement action sends a strong signal against social media-based market manipulation schemes. The involvement of company directors and promoters as enablers demonstrates SEBI's willingness to pursue insiders who facilitate such schemes.

**Investor Protection:** The order protects retail investors who may be lured by telegram channel stock tips without knowing the recommendations are part of coordinated manipulation schemes where operators profit from advance information.

**Precedent Value:** Establishes important precedent for prosecuting multi-party manipulation schemes involving: (1) social media platforms for tip dissemination, (2) advance information sharing, (3) company insider involvement, and (4) non-banking channel profit transfers.

**Operational Impact:** Market participants operating stock recommendation services on social media platforms face increased scrutiny. Companies must ensure directors/promoters do not participate in schemes to manipulate their stock.
