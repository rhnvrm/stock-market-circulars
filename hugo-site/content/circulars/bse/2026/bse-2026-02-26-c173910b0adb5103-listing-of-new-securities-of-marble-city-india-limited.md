These shares were issued on a preferential basis to Non-Promoters through conversion of warrants at an issue price of Rs. 100.50/- per share.

- Issue price: Rs. 100.50/- per share
- Allotted to Non-Promoters on a preferential basis via conversion of warrants

- Distribution numbers: 23325109 to 23575108
- ISIN: INE807H01023

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification under existing BSE listing norms for preferential allotments.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the new securities available for trading from February 27, 2026
- The allotted shares are subject to a lock-in period and cannot be traded until August 31, 2026
- Shares are subject to standard exchange trading and settlement rules

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** May 19, 2025
- **Trading Effective From:** February 27, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry:** August 31, 2026 (for all 2,50,000 shares, Dist. Nos. 23325109 to 23575108)

## Impact Assessment

The listing of 2,50,000 preferential shares represents a relatively small capital infusion for Marble City India Limited. The shares are fully locked in until August 31, 2026, meaning no immediate selling pressure from the allottees. Existing shareholders may note a marginal dilution in equity. The issue price of Rs. 100.50/- (face value Rs. 5/- + premium Rs. 95.50/-) reflects a significant premium, indicating confidence in the company's valuation at the time of allotment in May 2025. Overall market impact is minimal given the small size of the allotment.
