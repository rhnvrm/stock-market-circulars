## Summary

BSE has announced a demat auction under Settlement No. 800 dated January 19, 2026.

The auction quantities range from 1 share to 26,000 shares depending on the security.

## Key Points

- Settlement Number: 800
- Auction Date: January 19, 2026

- Scrip codes range from 500209 to 544646

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard operational circular for demat auction proceedings.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members with delivery shortages must participate in the demat auction to fulfill their settlement obligations
- Members must arrange for securities listed in the auction schedule
- Settlement must be completed as per BSE auction guidelines and timelines
- Members are responsible for ensuring availability of securities for delivery

## Important Dates

- **Auction Date:** January 19, 2026
- **Settlement No.:** 800

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 81 securities with varying liquidity profiles. While most quantities are small (1-500 shares), some securities have larger auction quantities that could impact short-term price discovery.

**Member Impact:** Medium - Members with short positions in these securities face potential buy-in costs at auction prices, which may be at a premium to market prices. This could result in financial penalties for members unable to deliver securities.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Investors who sold these securities expect timely settlement. Demat auctions ensure delivery completion, though with potential delays.

**Notable Securities:** The inclusion of high-profile stocks like RELIANCE, ITC, INFOSYS, ICICI BANK, and TATA MOTORS indicates delivery failures across market segments, though quantities are relatively small for these large-cap names.
