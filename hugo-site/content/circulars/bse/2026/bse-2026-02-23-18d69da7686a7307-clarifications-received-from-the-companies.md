## Key Points

- **Associated Coaters Limited** (BSE: ASSOCIATED, Scrip Code: 544183) responded on February 20, 2026 to a BSE query dated February 19, 2026, stating share price movement is purely market-driven and the company has no knowledge or control over it.

## Impact Assessment

These are standard surveillance-driven clarification disclosures with no material market impact. No new business developments, financial results, or corporate actions were revealed. Investors should note that BSE's surveillance mechanism flagged unusual price/volume activity in these scrips, but the companies have provided no fundamental explanation for the movements. The disclosures are of informational value only for tracking regulatory compliance behavior of the respective issuers.
