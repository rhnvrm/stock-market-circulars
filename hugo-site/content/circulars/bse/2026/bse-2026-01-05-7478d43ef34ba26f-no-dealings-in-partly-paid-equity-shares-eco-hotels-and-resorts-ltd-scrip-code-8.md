## Summary

BSE has issued a notice prohibiting dealings in partly paid equity shares of ECO HOTELS AND RESORTS LTD (Scrip Code 890225) effective January 8, 2026. The trading suspension is due to the record date being set for determining shareholders eligible to receive the first call money notice.

- Settlement number: DR-794/2025-2026
- Notice applies only to partly paid equity shares (Scrip Code 890225)
