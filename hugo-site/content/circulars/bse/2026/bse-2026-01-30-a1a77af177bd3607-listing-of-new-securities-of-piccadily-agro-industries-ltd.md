- **Trading Start Date**: February 1, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing notification for preferential allotment to promoters. The shares are locked-in until August 2027, preventing any immediate market trading impact. The allotment represents capital infusion through warrant conversion, which is positive for the company's capital structure but has no immediate trading implications due to the lock-in period.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Trading members need to update their systems to recognize the new distinctive numbers and increased share capital. The lock-in restriction simplifies operational handling as these shares cannot be traded until 2027.
