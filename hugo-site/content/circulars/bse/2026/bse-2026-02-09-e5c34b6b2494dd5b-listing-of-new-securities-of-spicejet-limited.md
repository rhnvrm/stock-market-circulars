## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The preferential allotment represents a significant equity dilution for SpiceJet Limited. The issuance of 11.25 crore shares will impact the company's shareholding pattern and potentially affect earnings per share calculations.

**Investor Impact**: The shares issued to non-promoters through loan conversion indicate debt restructuring activity. The lock-in period of approximately 6 months from trading commencement provides some stability to the stock price, preventing immediate sale by allottees.

**Operational Impact**: The conversion of loan to equity improves SpiceJet's debt-equity ratio and reduces interest burden, which may positively impact financial health. However, existing shareholders face dilution of their ownership stake.
