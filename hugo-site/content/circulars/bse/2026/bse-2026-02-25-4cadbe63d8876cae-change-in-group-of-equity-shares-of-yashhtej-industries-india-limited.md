This is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20260224-17 dated February 24, 2026.

## Impact Assessment

This change affects traders and investors holding or planning to trade in YASHHTEJ INDUSTRIES (INDIA) LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544708). Moving from Trade for Trade to the Rolling segment allows intraday netting and reduces the mandatory delivery obligation per trade, potentially improving liquidity and trading flexibility for this SME scrip. The impact is limited to this specific stock and is a standard post-SME IPO procedural transition on BSE.
