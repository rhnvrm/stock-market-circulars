## Summary

## Regulatory Changes

The Exchange has invoked its surveillance powers to modify price bands from existing levels. Price bands restrict the maximum price movement allowed during a trading session, with lower percentages indicating stricter controls. This measure is typically applied to stocks exhibiting unusual price movements, low liquidity, or other market integrity concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement the revised price bands in their trading systems before market opening on January 6, 2026
- All orders and trades in affected scrips must respect the new price band limits
- Members should inform clients trading in these securities about the revised restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 5, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 6, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revised price bands will significantly restrict intraday price movements for the affected securities. Stocks with 2% bands face the most severe restrictions, limiting daily price fluctuation to just ±2% from the previous close. This will reduce volatility but may also impact liquidity as traders face tighter constraints.

**Trading Impact**: Investors and traders in these 17 securities will experience limited price discovery and reduced ability to enter/exit positions at desired prices. The tighter bands suggest BSE has identified elevated surveillance concerns with these scrips.

**Investor Consideration**: The imposition of restrictive price bands serves as a cautionary indicator. Investors should exercise heightened due diligence before trading in these securities and be aware that such measures often reflect underlying concerns about stock quality, financial health, or market manipulation risks.
