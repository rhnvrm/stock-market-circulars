- Enhanced margin requirements
- Trading restrictions to curb excessive speculation
- Periodic review for stage progression or removal
- Special surveillance to monitor price and volume movements

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of 4 securities to LT-ASM and placement of Indosolar Ltd in direct Stage IV indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny on these stocks. Investors should exercise caution when trading these securities.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under LT-ASM face higher margin requirements and trading restrictions, which may reduce liquidity and increase transaction costs. Stage IV placement for Indosolar Ltd indicates most severe surveillance level.

**Investor Protection**: The framework aims to protect retail investors from potential losses due to excessive speculation or price manipulation in vulnerable securities. The consolidated list provides transparency on all securities currently under surveillance across different stages.
