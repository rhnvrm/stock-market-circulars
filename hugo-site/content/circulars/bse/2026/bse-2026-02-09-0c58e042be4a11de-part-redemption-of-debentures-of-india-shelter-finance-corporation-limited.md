## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

This part redemption affects holders of India Shelter Finance Corporation Limited's non-convertible debentures (7.85% series maturing November 30, 2026). The reduction in face value to Rs. 95,000 per debenture indicates a partial return of principal to investors. Trading members and debenture holders need to account for the adjusted face value in their records and transactions from the effective date. This is a standard corporate action with direct impact on debt instrument holders but limited broader market implications.
