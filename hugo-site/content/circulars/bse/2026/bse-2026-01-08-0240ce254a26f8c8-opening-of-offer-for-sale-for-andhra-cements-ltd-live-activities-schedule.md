## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The OFS of 75 lakh shares represents a significant offering that will provide liquidity and price discovery for Andhra Cements Ltd shares. The two-day structure allows broader participation across investor categories.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must coordinate bidding activities across two separate trading days for different investor categories, manage margin requirements (100% upfront for most categories), and handle potential carry-forward bids from T to T+1 day. The retail reservation of 10% ensures dedicated allocation opportunity for smaller investors. Multiple bidding is permitted, and retail investors have flexibility to bid in RI, RIC, and/or NII categories, though NII category bidders forfeit any seller discount.
