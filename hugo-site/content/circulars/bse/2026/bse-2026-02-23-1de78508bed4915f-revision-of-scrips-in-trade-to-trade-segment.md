## Key Points

- The movement is a continuation of an earlier notice dated February 19, 2026 (Notice No. 20260219-30).

- Svarnim Trade Udyog Limited (539911) moves from group XT to group X.

## Regulatory Changes

| Scrip Code | ISIN | Scrip Name | From Group | To Group |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 544391 | INE0KWJ01014 | Retaggio Industries Limited | MT | M |
| 539911 | INE730R01042 | Svarnim Trade Udyog Limited | XT | X |
| 539468 | INE761R01013 | Typhoon Financial Services Limited | XT | X |
| 526508 | INE825D01016 | Shahi Shipping Limited | XT | X |
| 519604 | INE565E01016 | Suryo Foods & Industries Ltd. | XT | X |
| 511630 | INE699B01027 | Sambhaav Media Ltd. | T | B |

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new group classifications for the listed securities.
- Orders and trades in these scrips should be processed under the new group designations as directed.
- Members should note that these scrips will no longer be subject to trade-for-trade settlement restrictions once moved to their new groups.

## Important Dates

- Notice Date: February 23, 2026
- Reference Notice: 20260219-30 dated February 19, 2026
- Effective Date: As per Exchange instructions (members should refer to the original notice and any supplementary communication for the exact effective date).

## Impact Assessment

Moving securities out of the trade-for-trade segment generally improves liquidity and trading flexibility for those scrips. In T2T segments, each trade must result in delivery (no netting or square-off on the same day is allowed), which restricts intraday trading. Transitioning to normal groups (M, X, B) allows standard rolling settlement, enabling intraday and carryforward positions. This is a positive development for retail and institutional traders holding or monitoring these six securities. The impact is moderate and confined to participants actively trading these specific scrips.
