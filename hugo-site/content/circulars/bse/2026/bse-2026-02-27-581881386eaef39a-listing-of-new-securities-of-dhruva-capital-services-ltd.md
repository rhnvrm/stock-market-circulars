## Impact Assessment

This listing adds 31,28,636 new equity shares to the tradable universe of Dhruva Capital Services Ltd on BSE. Given that the entire allotment is under lock-in initially, there is no immediate increase in freely tradable float on March 2, 2026. The larger tranche (20,28,636 shares) becomes freely tradable after September 30, 2026, and the remaining 11,00,000 shares after September 30, 2027. Market impact is confined to this specific company's share structure and liquidity profile, with no broader market implications.
