title: Split of Units (Change in Face Value) of KOTAK NIFTY BANK ETF Scheme
---

## Summary

Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company Limited has announced a unit split for the KOTAK NIFTY BANK ETF (Scrip Code: 590136, ISIN: INF174K01F59). The face value of each unit will be reduced from Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/-, effectively splitting each unit into 10 units. The record date and ex-date are both set for February 27, 2026.

## Key Points

- **Scheme:** KOTAK NIFTY BANK ETF (Scrip Code: 590136)
- **Existing ISIN:** INF174K01F59
- **Record Date:** February 27, 2026
- **Ex-Date / Settlement:** February 27, 2026 (DR-830/2025-2026)
- **Split Ratio:** Each unit of Rs. 10/- face value will be split to Re. 1/- face value (10:1 split)
- **New ISIN** will be communicated to the market via a separate notice
- Trading with the new face value will commence from February 27, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The Exchange is notifying trading members of a corporate action (face value change) as mandated under SEBI regulations governing ETF unit splits. A new ISIN will be allotted post-split and communicated separately, requiring market participants to update their systems accordingly.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members** must update their systems to reflect the new face value of Re. 1/- per unit effective February 27, 2026.
- Members should monitor the subsequent BSE notice for the new ISIN number and update records accordingly.
- Existing positions in the ETF should be adjusted to reflect the 10:1 unit split.

## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Circular Issued | February 20, 2026 |
| Record Date | February 27, 2026 |
| Ex-Date | February 27, 2026 |
| New Face Value Effective | February 27, 2026 (DR-830/2025-2026) |

## Impact Assessment

The unit split reduces the face value of KOTAK NIFTY BANK ETF from Rs. 10 to Re. 1, resulting in a 10x increase in the number of units held by investors. This typically lowers the per-unit price, improving liquidity and accessibility for retail investors. Trading members and custodians must update their systems before February 27, 2026. The pending new ISIN issuance means a follow-up notice is required before full operational readiness can be confirmed.
