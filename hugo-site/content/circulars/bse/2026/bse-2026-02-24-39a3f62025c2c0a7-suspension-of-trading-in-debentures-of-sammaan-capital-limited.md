## Impact Assessment

Impact is limited to debt segment participants holding or intending to trade in these four specific Sammaan Capital NCD instruments. This is a routine pre-redemption trading suspension and does not indicate any credit event or financial distress. Holders of these NCDs will receive redemption proceeds and accrued interest on the maturity date. No impact on Sammaan Capital's equity shares or other listed securities.
