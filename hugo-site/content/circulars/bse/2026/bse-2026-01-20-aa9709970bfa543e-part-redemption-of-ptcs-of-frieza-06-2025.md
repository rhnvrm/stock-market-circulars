## Impact Assessment

This corporate action has limited market-wide impact as it affects only holders of FRIEZA 06 2025 PTCs. The part redemption reduces the outstanding face value to Rs. 0.53 per PTC, which will affect the trading price and yield calculations going forward. Trading members dealing in this security must update their systems to reflect the reduced face value from the effective date. The action is routine for debt securities approaching maturity or structured with periodic redemptions.
