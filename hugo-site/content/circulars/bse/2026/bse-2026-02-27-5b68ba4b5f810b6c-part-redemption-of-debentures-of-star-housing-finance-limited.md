## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt segment corporate action affecting holders of the specific Star Housing Finance Limited NCD series (SHFL-13.10%-19-4-27-PVT). The part redemption reduces the face value of outstanding debentures to Rs. 30,952.39 per unit, reflecting the return of a portion of principal to debenture holders. Impact is limited to investors and trading members dealing in this specific instrument. Broader market impact is negligible given the privately placed nature of the security.
