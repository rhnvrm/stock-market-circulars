## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The tighter price bands will restrict intraday price movements in these securities, potentially reducing volatility but also limiting trading opportunities. Securities with 2% bands will see the most significant impact on liquidity.

**Trading Impact**: Day traders and short-term traders in these securities will face increased constraints. The price band restrictions may reduce speculative activity and improve price stability.

**Investor Impact**: Retail investors should note that tighter bands indicate enhanced surveillance, suggesting these securities may have exhibited unusual price or volume patterns. The restrictions aim to protect investors from excessive volatility while allowing orderly price discovery.
