- Lock-in restrictions apply to all 15,96,450 shares (Dist. Nos. 11724151 to 13320600) until September 30, 2027; these shares cannot be traded during the lock-in period

## Impact Assessment

The listing increases the total share count of Rama Petrochemicals Ltd. by 15,96,450 shares. Since all newly listed shares are locked in until September 30, 2027, there is no immediate increase in free-float or market liquidity. The preferential allotment to promoters at par (Rs. 10/-) may indicate a dilutive effect on existing shareholders depending on the prevailing market price. Overall market impact is low given the lock-in and the routine nature of the transaction.
