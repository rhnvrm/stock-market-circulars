## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The listing involves a relatively small number of shares (2.6 lakh equity shares) resulting from FCCB conversion that was allotted in 2017. The shares will trade with the same rights as existing equity shares. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital of GTL Infrastructure Ltd. The impact on stock liquidity and pricing is expected to be negligible given the small size relative to the company's total equity base.
