- Trading members must ensure proper platform access and connectivity (Internet and Leased Line options)
- Staggered bidding schedule (institutional vs retail) requires careful coordination
- Multiple margin and collateral requirements necessitate proper client categorization and fund management

**Investor Impact:**
- Retail investors have dedicated T+1 day bidding window with 10% reservation
