## Impact Assessment

**For Existing Shareholders**: Significant dilution with 99% capital reduction. Public shareholders holding reduced from over 4 crore shares to 2.5 lakh shares representing only 5% of restructured capital.

**For Market**: Stock classified under XT Group indicating high risk. Trade-to-Trade mechanism prevents intraday speculation. Limited floating stock (5%) may result in low liquidity initially.

**For Company**: Fresh start under new promoters post-insolvency with drastically reduced capital base. 95% shareholding by SRA provides clear management control.

**Trading Implications**: High volatility expected due to low free float, mandatory delivery-based trading, and special pre-open session requirements.
