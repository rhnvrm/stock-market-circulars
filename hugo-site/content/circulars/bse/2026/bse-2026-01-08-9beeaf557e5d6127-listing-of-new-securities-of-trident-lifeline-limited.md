## Summary

BSE has approved the listing of 55,800 new equity shares of Trident Lifeline Limited (Scrip Code: 543616) issued on a preferential basis through conversion of warrants. The shares will commence trading on January 9, 2026. The allotment was made to promoters and non-promoters at an issue price of Rs. 266 per share (face value Rs. 10 plus premium of Rs. 256). All shares are subject to a lock-in period until July 14, 2027.

- Distinctive numbers: 11642001 to 11697800

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for new securities issued through warrant conversion.

- All 55,800 shares are subject to mandatory lock-in restrictions
- Shares cannot be traded or transferred until the lock-in expiry date

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: December 5, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: January 9, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry**: July 14, 2027

## Impact Assessment

The listing has minimal market impact given the small issuance size of 55,800 shares. The preferential allotment through warrant conversion represents a relatively minor capital raise. The complete lock-in period extending to July 2027 means these shares will not contribute to trading float or liquidity for over 18 months. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new distinctive numbers and be aware of lock-in restrictions when processing orders.
