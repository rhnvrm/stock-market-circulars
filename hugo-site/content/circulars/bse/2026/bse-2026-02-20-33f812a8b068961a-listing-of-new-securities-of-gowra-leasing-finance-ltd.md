## Impact Assessment

This listing represents a capital raise by Gowra Leasing & Finance Ltd. through a preferential allotment, increasing the company's issued share capital. The new shares are pari-passu with existing shares, meaning no differentiation in dividend or voting rights. The effective float from these newly listed shares is partially constrained by lock-in periods: approximately 13,91,300 shares (locked until August 2027) and 9,02,100 shares (locked until August 2026) are not immediately tradeable. Market impact is expected to be limited given the small-cap nature of the company and the phased availability of free-float shares.
