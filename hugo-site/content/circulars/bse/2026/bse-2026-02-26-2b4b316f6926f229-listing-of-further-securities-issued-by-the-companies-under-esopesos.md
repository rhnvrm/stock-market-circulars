## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

The overall market impact is minimal. ESOP/ESOS listings are routine events representing employee compensation exercises and do not typically cause significant price movements. The largest tranche is Aditya Birla Capital at 971,589 shares, which remains a small fraction of its total outstanding shares. Axis Bank adds 263,239 shares. The remaining four companies — Nippon Life AMC, R Systems, SIS, and Tata Technologies — have even smaller tranches. Since there is no lock-in, these shares are freely tradeable from day one, but the quantities are unlikely to create notable selling pressure.
