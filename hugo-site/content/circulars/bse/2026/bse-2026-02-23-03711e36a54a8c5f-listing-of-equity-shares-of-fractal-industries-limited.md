## Impact Assessment

This is a routine compliance disclosure with no direct market-moving implications. The high promoter lock-in (100% of promoter shares) limits near-term promoter share supply. Public float is limited at approximately 30.93% (~2.43 million shares), which may contribute to low liquidity for this small-cap stock. No adverse findings or anomalies are indicated in the filing.
