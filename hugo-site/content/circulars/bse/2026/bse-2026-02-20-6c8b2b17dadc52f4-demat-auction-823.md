## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a routine operational notice issued under BSE's standard demat auction framework for handling short deliveries in the settlement cycle.

## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers with short delivery obligations in the above securities for Settlement 823 must participate in or be aware of the auction outcome.
- Clients/brokers who failed to deliver the listed securities must settle the difference at auction prices as determined by BSE.
- Buying brokers whose clients did not receive securities will receive shares procured through this auction or cash compensation at the higher of auction price or closing price.

## Important Dates

- Settlement No.: 823
- Auction Date: February 20, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine demat auction notice with moderate market impact. The largest single entry is KRETTO SYSCO with 40,000 shares, which may see price discovery impact during the auction session. Most other quantities are small and unlikely to cause significant price movement in the respective securities. Brokers with short delivery positions in Settlement 823 are directly affected and must account for auction settlement obligations. Large-cap inclusions (Infosys, TCS, L&T, JSW Steel, Aurobindo Pharma) are present in very small quantities and pose negligible market impact.
