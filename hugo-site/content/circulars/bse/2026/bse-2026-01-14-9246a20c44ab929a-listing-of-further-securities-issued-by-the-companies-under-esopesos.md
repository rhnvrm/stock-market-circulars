- **Notice Date**: January 14, 2026
- **Trading Commencement**: January 16, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (NA for all securities)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The share counts represent minor dilution for each company. Yes Bank's 528,275 shares and Suzlon Energy's 555,250 shares are the largest issuances but remain insignificant relative to their total outstanding shares.

**Operational Impact**: Routine administrative listing with no operational complexities. Standard ESOP allotments with immediate trading availability and no lock-in restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Negligible dilution effect. These employee stock options are part of normal compensation practices and were likely already factored into fully diluted share counts.
