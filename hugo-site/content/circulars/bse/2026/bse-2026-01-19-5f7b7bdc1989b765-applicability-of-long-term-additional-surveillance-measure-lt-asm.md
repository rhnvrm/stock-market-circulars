title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has issued an update on the applicability of the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective January 20, 2026. The circular identifies 4 new securities entering LT-ASM, 1 security moving to a higher ASM stage, 2 securities being directly placed in Stage IV, and 2 securities exiting the framework. The LT-ASM framework is a surveillance mechanism designed to alert investors about securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or other concerns.

## Key Points

- 4 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Auto Pins (India) Ltd, Lippi Systems Ltd, Panjon Ltd, and PG Foils Ltd
- Anand Rayons Ltd moved from Stage I to Stage II within LT-ASM framework
- 2 securities placed directly in Stage IV: CIAN Agro Industries & Infrastructure Ltd and Synthiko Foils Ltd
- 2 securities moving out of LT-ASM: Nikki Global Finance Ltd (moved to GSM Framework) and Boston Bio Systems Ltd (moved to GSM Framework)
- No securities moving to lower ASM stages
- All changes effective from January 20, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The LT-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance to securities exhibiting concerning trading patterns. Securities in this framework face:

- Trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday trading)
- 100% upfront margin requirements
- Progressive tightening of surveillance as securities move through stages (I to IV)
- Potential delisting if concerns persist

Securities may exit LT-ASM when moved to other surveillance frameworks like GSM (Graded Surveillance Measure), ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure), Trade-for-Trade, or IBC Framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Investors**: Must provide 100% upfront margin for trading in LT-ASM securities; no intraday trading permitted
- **Brokers**: Must ensure clients comply with margin requirements and settlement obligations
- **Listed Companies**: Should address underlying concerns causing LT-ASM classification to avoid progression to higher stages or delisting

## Important Dates

- **January 20, 2026**: Effective date for all LT-ASM changes outlined in this circular

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Securities under LT-ASM face significant liquidity constraints due to trade-for-trade settlement and 100% margin requirements, deterring speculative trading and reducing volumes.

**Investor Impact**: High - Existing investors in affected securities face reduced liquidity and higher capital requirements for trading. New investors are cautioned about heightened risks.

**Company Impact**: High - Companies whose securities enter or progress within LT-ASM face reputational concerns and pressure to address underlying issues. Stage IV placement indicates severe surveillance concerns and potential delisting risk.
