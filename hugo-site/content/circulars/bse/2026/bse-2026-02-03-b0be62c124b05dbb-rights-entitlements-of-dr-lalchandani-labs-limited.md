- Clarify that REs shall not be mistaken for ordinary shares of the company
- Include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases stating:

  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced on or before Issue Closing Date shall lapse and be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects existing shareholders of DR Lalchandani Labs Limited who wish to trade or renounce their rights entitlements during the 14-day trading window.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure proper client communication and disclosure requirements are met, including mandatory disclaimers in contract notes. The trade-for-trade settlement and dematerialized-only requirement necessitates appropriate system configurations.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders have the option to trade their rights entitlements in the secondary market during the renunciation period, providing liquidity and flexibility. However, failure to act (subscribe or renounce) by the issue closing date will result in permanent loss of entitlements.
