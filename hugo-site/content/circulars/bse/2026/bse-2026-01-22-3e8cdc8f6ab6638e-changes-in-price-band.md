title: Changes in Price Band for Three Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for three securities effective January 23, 2026. The changes involve tighter price band restrictions for Starlineps Enterprises Ltd and Switching Technologies Gunther Ltd (reduced to 2%), while Zenith Steel Pipes & Industries Ltd will have a 5% price band.

## Key Points

- Price band revisions effective from January 23, 2026
- Three scrips affected by the price band changes
- Starlineps Enterprises Ltd (540492): Price band revised to 2%
- Switching Technologies Gunther Ltd (517201): Price band revised to 2%
- Zenith Steel Pipes & Industries Ltd (531845): Price band revised to 5%
- Notice issued by BSE Surveillance Department
- Clarifications available at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

BSE has implemented surveillance measures by revising price bands from their existing levels. Price bands limit the maximum percentage movement in stock prices during a trading session, serving as a circuit breaker mechanism to prevent excessive volatility.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price band limits
- All trades in the affected scrips must adhere to the new price band restrictions from January 23, 2026
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 22, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 23, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements for the three affected securities. The 2% price band for Starlineps Enterprises Ltd and Switching Technologies Gunther Ltd indicates heightened surveillance measures, likely due to unusual price movements or volatility concerns. The 5% band for Zenith Steel Pipes & Industries Ltd provides moderate trading flexibility while maintaining surveillance controls. Trading members and investors should be aware of these restrictions when executing orders in these securities.
