## Summary

BSE has announced that the equity shares of MSAFE EQUIPMENTS LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544695) will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to the Rolling segment (M Group) effective February 18, 2026. This follows the company's SME IPO listing and represents a routine transition in trading segments.

## Key Points

- Company: MSAFE EQUIPMENTS LIMITED (SME IPO)
- Scrip Code: 544695
- Current Segment: Trade for Trade segment (MT Group)
- New Segment: Rolling segment (M Group)
- Effective Date: Wednesday, February 18, 2026
- Notice Number: 20260204-6
- Reference: Continuation of Notice No. 20260203-45 dated February 03, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for MSAFE EQUIPMENTS LIMITED will change from Trade for Trade settlement (where each trade settles individually) to Rolling settlement (standard T+2 settlement cycle). This is a standard progression for SME IPO stocks after initial listing period.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members should take note of the segment change
- Update internal systems to reflect the new trading group (M Group)
- Contact: Mr. Anurag Jain, Tel: 022-2272 8822 for further details
- Adjust trading strategies and risk parameters as applicable for rolling settlement

## Important Dates

- **February 03, 2026**: Initial notice issued (Notice No. 20260203-45)
- **February 04, 2026**: Confirmation notice issued
- **February 18, 2026**: Effective date for segment transfer to M Group

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Medium - The shift from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment will improve liquidity and reduce settlement times. Investors can now trade with standard T+2 settlement instead of delivery-based settlement for each trade.

**Market Participants**: Trading members and investors should adjust their trading strategies. The stock will have better liquidity in rolling settlement compared to the restrictive Trade for Trade segment.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers need to update their systems to handle the stock under rolling settlement norms rather than Trade for Trade basis, which is a routine operational adjustment.
