## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The Rs. 37,000 crore SDL issuance represents routine state borrowing activity and provides investment opportunities in state government securities across 15 states. The offering includes a good mix of short-term (4-year) to long-term (30-year) securities, catering to different investor duration preferences.

**Operational Impact:** Low to Medium - Trading members need to process bids through the established NCB-GSec module. The staggered deadlines (direct investors vs. members) allow for orderly bid collection. Support infrastructure is in place with dedicated teams for technical, trading, and settlement queries.

**Investor Impact:** Medium - The non-competitive bidding facility allows retail and institutional investors to participate in SDL auctions without competing on yield, making it easier to invest in state government securities. The minimum investment of Rs. 10,000 makes these securities accessible to smaller investors.

**Liquidity Impact:** Positive - Addition of new SDL securities and re-issuance of existing ones enhances liquidity in the debt market and provides more investment options for fixed-income investors seeking state government exposure.
