## Impact Assessment

This disclosure has limited market impact as it pertains specifically to the IPO process of PAN HR Solution Limited. The anchor round allocation is a standard pre-IPO step that provides price discovery and confidence to retail investors. The absence of domestic mutual fund participation may indicate limited institutional interest, which could affect the main IPO subscription. Prospective IPO investors should note the anchor pricing of ₹78 per share as a reference point for the public issue.
