## Impact Assessment

This rights issue will dilute existing shareholding proportionally for shareholders who do not subscribe. The ratio of 29:60 at an issue price of Rs. 16.68 (face value Rs. 10 + premium Rs. 6.68) represents a below-market or at-market pricing depending on the prevailing share price. Existing shareholders need to decide whether to subscribe to maintain their proportional stake. The impact is limited to shareholders of Hilton Metal Forging Limited and has no broader market-wide implications.
