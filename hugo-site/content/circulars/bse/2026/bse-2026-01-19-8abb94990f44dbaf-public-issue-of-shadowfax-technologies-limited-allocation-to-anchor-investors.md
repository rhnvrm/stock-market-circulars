## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The successful anchor round with significant oversubscription from marquee domestic and international institutional investors signals strong market confidence in Shadowfax Technologies. The logistics and technology sector company attracted diverse investor participation including pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and foreign portfolio investors.

**Investor Interest**: The participation of Government Pension Fund Global (Norway's sovereign wealth fund) with the largest allocation of ₹120 crores and ICICI Prudential Flexicap Fund with ₹97.27 crores demonstrates institutional conviction. The diversity of 39 anchor investors reduces concentration risk.

**IPO Outlook**: Strong anchor allocation typically provides positive momentum for the retail and institutional portions of an IPO. The pricing at ₹124 per share establishes a reference point for the public issue. The logistics and delivery sector focus of Shadowfax may attract investor attention given the growth in e-commerce and quick commerce segments in India.
