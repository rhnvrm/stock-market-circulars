## Regulatory Changes

BSE has implemented price band modifications as a surveillance measure. The revised price bands are:

| Scrip Code | Company Name | Revised Price Band |
|------------|--------------|--------------------|
| 523369 | DCM Shriram Industries Ltd | 20% |
| 544549 | Earkart Ltd | 2% |
| 544199 | GEM Enviro Management Ltd | 5% |
| 513309 | Golkonda Aluminium Extrusions Ltd | 5% |
| 541276 | Hardwyn India Ltd | 5% |
| 507438 | IFB Agro Industries Ltd | 5% |
| 538837 | Jeevan Scientific Technology Ltd | 2% |
| 539121 | Palco Metals Ltd | 5% |
| 538714 | Sangam Finserv Ltd | 10% |

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must adhere to the revised price bands from January 9, 2026
- All trades in the mentioned scrips must be executed within the new price band limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 8, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 9, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions indicate heightened surveillance on these securities, likely due to unusual price movements or volatility concerns. Tighter price bands (2% for Earkart and Jeevan Scientific) will significantly restrict intraday price movements and may reduce trading volumes. The 20% band for DCM Shriram Industries suggests a relaxation or normalization of trading restrictions. Traders and investors in these scrips should expect limited price discovery and potentially reduced liquidity during the period these bands remain in effect.
