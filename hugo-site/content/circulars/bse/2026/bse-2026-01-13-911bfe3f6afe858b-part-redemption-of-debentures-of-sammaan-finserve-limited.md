## Impact Assessment

This part redemption will affect all holders of the four debenture series as they will receive partial principal repayment along with interest payment. The reduction in face value to Rs. 400 per debenture indicates a partial return of capital to debenture holders. Trading members need to ensure their systems are updated to handle the reduced face value for continued trading and settlement operations. The debt segment will see reduced outstanding principal amounts for these securities.
