## Summary

Capricorn Systems Global Solutions Ltd (BSE Code: 512169) has announced a rights issue offering 6 new equity shares of Re.10/- each for every 1 existing equity share held. The issue is priced at par (Rs.10 per share), payable in full on application. The record date is fixed as January 30, 2026, and trading will commence on ex-rights basis from the same date.

## Key Points

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must execute all transactions in the company's equity shares on ex-rights basis from January 30, 2026
- Shareholders on record as of January 30, 2026 will be eligible to participate in the rights issue
- Eligible shareholders must subscribe and pay the full issue price on application

## Important Dates

- **January 27, 2026**: Notice date
- **January 30, 2026**: Record date for rights issue eligibility
- **January 30, 2026**: Ex-rights trading commences (Settlement No. DR-809/2025-2026)

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: This is a highly dilutive rights issue with a 6:1 ratio, meaning the share capital will increase sevenfold if fully subscribed. Existing shareholders must participate to avoid significant dilution of their ownership stake. The at-par pricing (Rs.10) suggests the company is raising capital without offering a discount to market price.

**Trading Impact**: Trading will switch to ex-rights basis from January 30, 2026, which typically results in share price adjustment to reflect the rights offering value. Investors should be aware that shares purchased on or after this date will not carry rights entitlement.

**Market Impact**: Medium impact. The substantial dilution may affect stock liquidity and price dynamics. The company's capital structure will change significantly if the issue is well-subscribed.
