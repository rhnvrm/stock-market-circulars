## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. The listing involves a relatively small number of shares (4,00,000) issued on a preferential basis to non-promoters. The lock-in period until July 29, 2026 means these shares will not be available for trading in the immediate term, limiting any potential supply-side pressure on the stock. This is a routine corporate action related to warrant conversion and does not signal any significant operational or strategic changes for Kinetic Engineering Ltd.
