## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to recognize the new ISIN INE411D01023 for trades executed on or after January 12, 2026
- All market participants should ensure proper mapping of the old ISIN to the new ISIN in their records
- Shareholders will receive shares with the new face value of Rs.5 instead of Rs.10

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 7, 2026

- **Previous Notice Reference**: December 26, 2025 (Notice No. 20251226-42)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The stock subdivision and ISIN change will affect existing shareholders who will see their share count double with proportionally reduced face value. Trading systems and depository participants need to update records to reflect the new ISIN.

**Operational Impact**: Medium. Brokers, custodians, and trading members must ensure their systems are updated before the ex-date to handle trades under the new ISIN correctly. The subdivision improves share affordability and liquidity for retail investors.

**Investor Impact**: Neutral to positive. While the total investment value remains unchanged, the lower face value per share may improve trading liquidity and make the stock more accessible to small investors.
