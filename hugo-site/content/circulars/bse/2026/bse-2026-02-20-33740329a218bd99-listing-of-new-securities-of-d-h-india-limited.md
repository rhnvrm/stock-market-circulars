## Impact Assessment

The listing of 20,47,000 new rights-basis equity shares issued to promoters represents a routine capital event for D & H India Limited. The addition of these shares to the tradeable float is limited in broad market impact. Existing shareholders should note the increase in total share count and the pari-passu ranking of new shares with old equity shares. The issuance at a significant premium (Rs. 110/- over face value of Rs. 10/-) reflects the company's valuation at the time of the rights issue.
