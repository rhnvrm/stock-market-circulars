## Impact Assessment

This enforcement action highlights SEBI's strict monitoring of investment advisers and zero tolerance for fraudulent operations. The case demonstrates serious violations where a registered IA operated as a front while an unregistered person controlled operations and allegedly franchised the registration to other unregistered entities. This impacts investor protection as clients believed they were dealing with a SEBI-registered adviser when actual operations were conducted by unregistered persons. Market participants should note that SEBI actively investigates complaints and conducts surprise inspections. Investment advisers must ensure compliance with registration requirements and that only authorized persons provide advisory services. The case serves as a warning against proxy operations and franchisee models in investment advisory business.
