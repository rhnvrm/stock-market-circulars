## Impact Assessment

This listing represents a dilution event for existing shareholders of KESAR INDIA LIMITED, with approximately 32 lakh new shares entering the market. However, the staggered lock-in periods (extending to July 2027) will limit immediate supply pressure. The preferential issue raised approximately Rs. 111.94 crores at the issue price of Rs. 350/- per share, providing capital infusion to the company. Market impact is limited to KESAR INDIA LIMITED stakeholders, with no broader market implications.
