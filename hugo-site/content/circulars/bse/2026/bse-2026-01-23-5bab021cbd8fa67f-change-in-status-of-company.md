## Impact Assessment

This circular has specific impact on Nutraplus India Limited and its shareholders. The change from "Delisted" to "Suspended" status provides a pathway for potential relisting or resolution of the company's trading status. For shareholders, this means the company remains within the BSE framework under suspended status rather than being completely delisted. The rescission by the Securities Appellate Tribunal indicates legal intervention in the delisting process, which may have implications for ongoing regulatory or legal proceedings related to the company.
