title: Trading Holiday on January 15, 2026 - Mutual Fund Segment Revised Settlement
  Calendar
---

## Summary

BSE has announced a trading holiday for the Mutual Fund segment on Thursday, January 15, 2026, due to Municipal Corporation Elections in Maharashtra. The exchange has issued a revised settlement calendar for January 2026 covering subscription transactions (liquid and non-liquid) and redemption transactions. All market participants on BSE StAR MF platform must follow the updated settlement schedules.

## Key Points

- No trading in Mutual Fund segment on January 15, 2026
- Revised settlement calendar effective for entire January 2026
- Separate schedules for subscription (liquid and non-liquid) and redemption transactions
- 20 settlement cycles (2526187 to 2526206) scheduled for January 2026
- Funds payout to AMCs for non-liquid transactions before 3:00 PM on T day
- NFO scheme payouts on T day basis funds confirmation received by ICCL till 6:00 PM

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a one-time schedule adjustment to accommodate the state election holiday.

## Compliance Requirements

- All BSE StAR MF market participants must adhere to revised settlement calendar
- AMCs must process transactions according to updated settlement dates
- Liquid fund transactions maintain T+0 settlement cycle (same-day settlement)
- Non-liquid subscription transactions follow T+1 to T+4 settlement cycles
- Redemption settlements depend on scheme-specific TAT (T+1 to T+10)
- Investors should verify redemption TAT from scheme master on BSE Star MF Platform

## Important Dates

- **January 15, 2026**: Trading holiday (Municipal Corporation Elections in Maharashtra)
- **January 14, 2026**: Last trading day before holiday (Settlement 2526196, payout on January 16)
- **January 16, 2026**: First trading day after holiday (Settlement 2526197 resumes)
- **January 1-30, 2026**: Revised settlement calendar in effect

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Complete suspension of mutual fund trading affects all subscription and redemption orders on January 15, requiring market participants to adjust their operational schedules. Settlement cycle disruption shifts the January 14 payout to January 16, creating a two-day gap instead of standard one-day cycle.

**Market Participant Impact**: AMCs, distributors, and investors must account for the trading gap when planning transactions around the holiday period. Liquid fund investors expecting same-day settlement on January 14 will receive units on January 16.

**Settlement Impact**: The revised calendar maintains systematic settlement numbering (2526187-2526206) but adjusts dates to skip January 15. Post-holiday settlements resume normal T+1 cycles starting January 16, ensuring no long-term disruption to the monthly settlement framework.
