## Impact Assessment

The impact is minimal as only 91 shares are being listed, representing a negligible quantity relative to ICICI Bank's total outstanding shares. This is an administrative action to release bonus shares that were previously held in abeyance, likely due to pending shareholder documentation or other compliance matters now resolved. No material impact on stock price or trading volume is expected.
