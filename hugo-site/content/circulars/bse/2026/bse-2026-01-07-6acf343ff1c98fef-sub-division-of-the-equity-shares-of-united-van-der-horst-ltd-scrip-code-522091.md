title: 'Sub-Division of Equity Shares of United Van Der Horst Ltd (Scrip Code: 522091)'
---

## Summary

United Van Der Horst Ltd (Scrip Code: 522091) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs. 5/- will be split into five equity shares with a face value of Re. 1/- each. The record date for this corporate action is January 22, 2026, and the new structure will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Company: United Van Der Horst Ltd (Scrip Code: 522091)
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Split Ratio: 1 share of Rs. 5/- into 5 shares of Re. 1/- each
- Segment: Equity - Dematerialised Securities (Rolling Settlement)
- Record Date: January 22, 2026
- Effective Date: January 22, 2026
- Notice Number: 20260107-19
- Reference: DR-804/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN No. INE890G01021 (Rs. 5/- paid-up) will become invalid for all exchange transactions from January 22, 2026 onwards. A new ISIN number for Re. 1/- paid-up shares will be communicated to the market through a separate notice from BSE.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that transactions using the old ISIN (INE890G01021) will not be valid on or after January 22, 2026
- Members should await the separate notice announcing the new ISIN number for Re. 1/- paid-up shares
- All systems and records must be updated to reflect the new share structure and ISIN from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** January 7, 2026
- **Record Date:** January 22, 2026
- **Effective Date:** January 22, 2026 (from which new ISIN and sub-divided shares will be applicable)
- **Old ISIN Invalid From:** January 22, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by a factor of 5 while reducing the face value proportionately. The action typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors. Existing shareholders will automatically receive 5 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. The total value of holdings remains unchanged, but the per-share price will adjust accordingly. Trading systems, demat accounts, and portfolio management systems will need to reflect the change from the effective date.
