title: Placing Orders at Unrealistic Prices
---

## Summary

BSE has issued Notice No. 20260107-43 dated January 07, 2026, addressing the issue of orders being placed at unrealistic prices that are significantly away from Last Traded Price (LTP), Reference price, or Theoretical Price. The exchange warns that such orders may distort order books and disrupt market equilibrium, impacting market integrity. Members are required to implement appropriate systems and controls, including for orders placed through Algorithms, IBT (Internet Based Trading), and STWT (Single Touch Without Touch). Non-compliance may attract regulatory action under Exchange regulations.

## Key Points

- Exchange has observed instances of orders placed at unrealistic prices significantly away from LTP/Reference price/Theoretical Price
- Such orders can distort the order book and disrupt market equilibrium
- Market integrity is impacted by these unrealistic order placements
- Members must exercise due care and diligence while placing orders
- Appropriate systems and controls must be implemented for all order types
- Controls apply to orders placed through Algorithms, IBT, and STWT
- Applies to both own account trading and client orders
- Non-compliance will attract regulatory action

## Regulatory Changes

This circular reinforces existing pre-trade risk control requirements and emphasizes stricter enforcement. While not introducing new regulations, it signals heightened surveillance and potential regulatory action against members who fail to implement adequate controls on order placement at unrealistic prices.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This advisory affects all trading members and their order placement practices. Members must review and potentially upgrade their pre-trade risk management systems to ensure compliance.
