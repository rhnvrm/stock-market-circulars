## Impact Assessment

Impact is limited to debt segment trading members. The listing introduces approximately Rs. 12,500 crore worth of Commercial Paper supply across five instruments (based on face values: 10,000 + 9,000 + 2,000 + 2,000 + 2,000 = 25,000 units × Rs. 5 lakh = Rs. 125 billion). All issuances carry the highest short-term credit ratings (A1+), indicating negligible credit risk. The short tenor of SBICAP and KEC CPs (~3 months) and the one-year tenor of Bajaj Housing Finance and Birla Group CPs provide varied liquidity options for institutional investors in the debt segment. No impact on equity markets.
