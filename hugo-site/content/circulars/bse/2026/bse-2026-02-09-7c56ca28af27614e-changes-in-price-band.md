## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements revised price band restrictions as a surveillance measure. Price bands limit the maximum percentage movement (up or down) a security can experience in a single trading day, helping to control excessive volatility and protect investors.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new price bands
- The revised price bands must be implemented before trading commences on February 10, 2026
- All trades in affected securities must comply with the new price band limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact the Surveillance department at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 9, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 10, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements in 17 securities, particularly those with 2% and 5% bands. This may reduce trading volumes and liquidity in affected securities but provides investor protection against excessive volatility.

**Trading Impact:** Traders and investors in these securities will face tighter price movement limits, requiring adjusted trading strategies. Securities with 2% bands will have significantly restricted price discovery mechanisms.

**Investor Impact:** The price band revisions indicate heightened surveillance on these securities, signaling potential concerns about volatility or market manipulation. Investors should exercise caution and be aware of the restricted trading ranges when dealing with these securities.
