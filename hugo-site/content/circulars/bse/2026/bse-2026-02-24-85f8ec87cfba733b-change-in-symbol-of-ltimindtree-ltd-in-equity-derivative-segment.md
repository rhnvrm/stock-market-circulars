## Summary

BSE has issued Notice No. 20260224-52 informing trading members of a symbol change for LTIMindtree Ltd (scrip code 540005) in the equity derivatives segment. The underlying asset name in column 5 of all contract master files will be updated from **LTIM** to **LTM**, effective February 27, 2026.

## Key Points

- The symbol change applies to all contract master files in the equity derivatives segment.
- Scrip code 540005 (LTIMindtree Ltd) is the affected underlying.
- The existing underlying asset name **LTIM** will be replaced with **LTM** in column 5 of contract master files.
- No other parameters in the contract master files will change.
- Updated contract master files reflecting the new symbol will be available as part of end-of-day files on **February 26, 2026**.
- The change becomes effective from **February 27, 2026**.

## Regulatory Changes

This is an administrative/operational update to the contract master files in the equity derivatives segment. No regulatory rule changes are involved; it is a symbol rename only.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their internal systems, back-office software, and algorithmic trading setups to recognise the new symbol **LTM** in place of **LTIM** for LTIMindtree Ltd derivatives contracts.
- Members should download and process the updated end-of-day contract master files on February 26, 2026 to capture the change before trading opens on February 27, 2026.

## Important Dates

- **February 26, 2026**: Updated contract master files with the new symbol (LTM) will be available in end-of-day files.
- **February 27, 2026**: Symbol change becomes effective in all equity derivative segment contract master files.

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited and operational in nature. Trading members who rely on automated systems or algorithmic strategies referencing the LTIM symbol in derivatives will need to update their configurations before the market opens on February 27, 2026. No change in contract specifications, lot sizes, margins, or any other trading parameters is involved, so market impact is negligible. Failure to update systems in time could cause reconciliation issues in back-office or order management systems.
