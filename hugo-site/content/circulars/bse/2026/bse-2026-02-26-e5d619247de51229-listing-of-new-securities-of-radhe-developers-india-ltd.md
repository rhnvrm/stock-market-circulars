## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing circular with low immediate market impact. The entire allotment of 2,51,39,620 shares is subject to lock-in until September 2027, meaning no additional supply will enter the market from these shares in the near term. The preferential allotment to promoters may slightly increase promoter holding percentage in Radhe Developers (India) Ltd. Existing shareholders should note the dilution in their shareholding percentage due to the new share issuance.
