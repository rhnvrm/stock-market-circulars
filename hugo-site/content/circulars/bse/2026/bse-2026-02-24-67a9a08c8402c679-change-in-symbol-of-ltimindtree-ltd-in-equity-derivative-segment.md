## Key Points

- The symbol in equity derivative segment contract master files for LTIMindtree Ltd changes from **LTIM** to **LTM**
- Scrip Code in equity segment remains 540005
- Only the underlying asset name in column 5 of contract master files is affected
- No other parameters in the contract master files will change
- Updated end-of-day contract master files reflecting the change will be available on February 26, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

This is an administrative update to the contract master files in the equity derivatives segment. The underlying asset name identifier for LTIMindtree Ltd is being revised from LTIM to LTM across all equity derivative contract master files.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their internal systems, trading platforms, and references to reflect the new symbol **LTM** for LTIMindtree Ltd in the equity derivatives segment
- Members should download the updated end-of-day contract master files on February 26, 2026 to incorporate the change before trading commences on February 27, 2026

## Important Dates

- **February 26, 2026**: Updated end-of-day contract master files with the new symbol will be published
- **February 27, 2026**: New symbol LTM becomes effective in the equity derivatives segment

## Impact Assessment

This is a low-severity administrative change with medium operational impact for trading members. While no trading parameters (lot size, strike prices, expiry, etc.) are affected, members using automated systems or data feeds that reference the LTIM symbol in the derivatives segment must update their configurations before February 27, 2026 to avoid disruption. The equity segment scrip code (540005) and all other contract parameters remain unchanged.
