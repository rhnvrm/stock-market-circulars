## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 445 scrips across multiple sectors. While this is a routine operational activity, the large number of securities and some significant quantities (especially TOURISM FINA with 306,529 shares and WELCURE DRUG with 80,004 shares) indicate substantial delivery shortages that require auction settlement.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Broker-dealers and clearing members with open positions in these securities must arrange for auction participation or alternative settlement. The wide range of securities affected may require operational coordination across multiple trading desks.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Individual investors generally not directly impacted unless their broker has delivery obligations. However, auction settlements can sometimes lead to price volatility in affected scrips during the auction window.

**Sectoral Distribution:** The auction list reflects delivery shortages across all major sectors, suggesting broad-based trading activity and settlement challenges rather than sector-specific issues.
