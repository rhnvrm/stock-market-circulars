## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of 6 securities into different stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective from the date of this circular. Two securities (Kiduja India Ltd. and GSL Securities Ltd.) are being moved to GSM Stage I, while four securities (Southern Latex Ltd., Inland Printers Ltd., Kachchh Minerals Ltd., and BCL Enterprises Limited) are being moved to GSM Stage II. The GSM framework is designed to alert investors about securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or other concerns.

## Important Dates

- Implementation: Immediate upon circular issuance

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The movement of these 6 securities into GSM stages will result in reduced liquidity due to trade-for-trade settlement requirements and higher transaction costs due to increased margin requirements. Investors holding these securities may face difficulty in exiting positions quickly.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members will need to adjust their risk management systems to account for higher margins and trade-for-trade settlement. Retail investors may face increased costs and reduced flexibility in trading these securities.

**Investor Alert:** The inclusion of securities in GSM framework serves as a warning signal to investors about potential volatility or other concerns identified by the exchange. Investors should exercise enhanced due diligence before trading in these securities.
