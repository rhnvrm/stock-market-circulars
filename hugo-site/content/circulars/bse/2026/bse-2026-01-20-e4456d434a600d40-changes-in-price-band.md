title: Revision of Price Bands for Six Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for six equity securities effective January 21, 2026. The changes include reductions to tighter bands (2%, 5%) for certain stocks and adjustments to 10% bands for others, reflecting heightened surveillance measures or volatility management.

## Key Points

- Six securities subject to price band revisions from existing levels
- Changes effective from January 21, 2026
- Price bands range from 2% to 10% depending on the security
- Baazar Style Retail and Gabriel Pet Straps revised to 10% band
- Bits Ltd revised to tightest 2% band
- Neptune Logitek, S. M. Gold, and Yuvraaj Hygiene Products revised to 5% band
- Circular issued by BSE Surveillance department

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This circular implements existing surveillance mechanisms through price band adjustments as per BSE's risk management and surveillance protocols.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect revised price bands
- All trades in the affected securities must adhere to new price band limits from January 21, 2026
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Order management systems must be configured to reject orders outside the revised price bands

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** January 20, 2026
- **Effective Date:** January 21, 2026 (revised price bands applicable from market opening)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Moderate impact on the six affected securities. Tighter price bands (especially the 2% band for Bits Ltd) will limit intraday price movements, potentially reducing volatility but also constraining price discovery. The 5% bands for Neptune Logitek, S. M. Gold, and Yuvraaj Hygiene Products suggest these securities are under surveillance measures.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update risk management systems and ensure order entry controls reflect the new bands. Investors holding these securities should be aware that daily price movements will be restricted within the specified bands.

**Liquidity Considerations:** Tighter price bands may reduce trading volumes if investors find the restricted price movement range unattractive, though it may also encourage more stable trading patterns and reduce speculative activity.
