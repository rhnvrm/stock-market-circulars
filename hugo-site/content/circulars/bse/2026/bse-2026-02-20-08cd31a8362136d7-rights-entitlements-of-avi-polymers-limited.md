## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform all clients about the commencement of trading in REs, specifically mentioning the ISIN (INE897N20014) and clarifying that REs are not ordinary shares
- Contract notes and bills for RE purchases must prominently display a disclaimer stating that purchase of REs only entitles the holder to participate in the ongoing Rights Issue or renounce the REs before issue closure
- Trading members must ensure clients are aware that unrenounced and unsubscribed REs will lapse after the Issue Closing Date

## Important Dates

- **RE Trading Start Date:** Monday, February 23, 2026
- **RE Trading Period (Renunciation):** February 23, 2026 to Thursday, March 12, 2026
- **Rights Issue Open Date:** February 23, 2026
- **Rights Issue Close Date:** March 17, 2026
- **RE Lapse/Extinguishment:** After March 17, 2026 (Issue Closing Date)

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a medium impact on existing shareholders and investors of AVI POLYMERS LIMITED. Shareholders who received Rights Entitlements can either subscribe to the rights issue by paying the requisite application money or renounce their REs by selling them on the exchange during the trading window (February 23 – March 12, 2026). The trade-for-trade settlement mechanism limits netting and speculative activity. Investors should note the strict lapse clause — any REs neither subscribed nor renounced by March 17, 2026 will be extinguished, resulting in a loss of entitlement value.
