## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must take note of the new securities available for trading
- Updated share capital and outstanding shares to be reflected in trading systems

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** January 30, 2026
- **Effective Trading Date:** February 1, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry:** Not applicable (no lock-in period)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The quantities being listed represent small percentages of the respective companies' outstanding shares. The largest issuance of 1.09 million shares by IDFC First Bank is unlikely to cause significant price movement given the bank's large float.
