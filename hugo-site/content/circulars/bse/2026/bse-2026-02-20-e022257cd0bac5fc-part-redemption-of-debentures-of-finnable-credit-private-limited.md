## Impact Assessment

The impact is confined to holders of Finnable Credit Private Limited's NCD series FCPL-12.25%-11-6-28-PVT. The partial redemption reduces the face value per debenture to Rs. 90,000, affecting accrued interest calculations and secondary market pricing for this instrument from the effective date. Broader market impact is negligible given the privately placed nature of the instrument.
