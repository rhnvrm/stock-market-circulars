## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities moving to higher GSM stages will face increased trading restrictions including margin requirements and settlement constraints. Stage III securities will have the most severe restrictions with trade-for-trade settlement and periodic call auctions only.

**Liquidity Impact**: Medium - Higher GSM stages typically result in reduced liquidity due to stricter trading conditions and margin requirements. Investors may find it more difficult to enter or exit positions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance measures and potential difficulty in trading. New investors should exercise caution when considering investment in GSM securities.
