---

## Summary

WhiteOak Capital Mutual Fund has introduced a Daily frequency option under its Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) facility for all existing schemes, effective February 01, 2026. This new frequency allows investors to make SIP investments on all business days from Monday to Friday, with minimum investment amounts of Rs. 100 (Rs. 500 for debt schemes and ELSS Tax Saver Fund) and a minimum of 6 installments.

## Key Points

- Daily SIP frequency available across all existing WhiteOak Capital Mutual Fund schemes
- Effective date: February 01, 2026
- Investment on all business days (Monday to Friday)
- Minimum investment: Rs. 100 per installment (in multiples of Re. 1)
- Minimum investment for debt schemes: Rs. 500 (in multiples of Re. 1)
- Minimum investment for ELSS Tax Saver Fund: Rs. 500 (in multiples of Rs. 500)
- Minimum 6 installments required
- Investors must select "As & when presented" as payment frequency in SIP Mandate/OTM
- Daily SIP installments skipped if falling on non-business days
- Unit allotment subject to realization of credit in the scheme
- Multiple installments realized on same day processed at applicable NAV
- Daily SIP frequency not available for Daily IDCW Plans
- SIP Top-Up frequency limited to half-yearly/yearly with minimum Rs. 100
- SIP Pause and Modify facility not available under Daily frequency
- Registration discontinued after 3 consecutive dishonored installments

## Regulatory Changes

This is an operational enhancement rather than a regulatory change. WhiteOak Capital Asset Management Limited has amended the Statement of Additional Information (SAI) and Scheme Information Documents (SIDs) to incorporate the Daily SIP frequency option.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors enrolling for Daily SIP must select "As & when presented" as payment frequency in the SIP Mandate/OTM
- All existing terms and conditions of SIP facility under other frequencies remain applicable to Daily SIP
- The AMC/Trustee reserves the right to change, modify, or withdraw the Daily SIP facility

## Important Dates

- **January 22, 2026**: Notice dated
- **February 01, 2026**: Daily SIP frequency effective date

## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it pertains to mutual fund investment facilities rather than equity market operations. The introduction of Daily SIP provides enhanced flexibility for retail investors in WhiteOak Capital Mutual Fund schemes, potentially improving accessibility to systematic investment options. The change is operational in nature and does not affect listed companies, trading mechanisms, or compliance requirements for market participants beyond mutual fund investors.
