title: 'Resolution Plan: Reduction of Equity Share Capital of INDUS FILA LIMITED'
---

## Summary

INDUS FILA LIMITED (Scrip Code: 530715/532821) has announced a reduction in equity share capital pursuant to a Resolution Plan approved by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Bengaluru Bench. The capital reduction involves a 100:1 share consolidation for public shareholders and complete extinguishment of promoter and promoter group shareholding. Record date is February 09, 2026. Trading in the company's equity shares remains under suspension.

## Key Points

- Record Date: February 09, 2026 for capital reduction
- Ex-date: February 09, 2026
- Settlement No: DR-816/2025-2026
- Public shareholders will receive 1 equity share of Rs. 10/- for every 100 shares held
- Entire shareholding of existing Promoter and Promoter Group will be completely extinguished
- Resolution Plan approved by NCLT, Bengaluru Bench, Court-1
- Company scrip codes: 530715 and 532821
- Trading in equity shares currently under suspension

## Regulatory Changes

The capital reduction is being implemented under a Court-approved Resolution Plan sanctioned by the National Company Law Tribunal, Bengaluru Bench. This involves:

1. **Share Consolidation for Public Shareholders**: The share capital will be consolidated at a ratio of 100:1, meaning public shareholders holding 100 existing equity shares will receive only 1 new equity share of Rs. 10/-

2. **Promoter Shareholding Extinguishment**: The entire shareholding of existing Promoters and Promoter Group members will be totally extinguished, resulting in zero promoter holding post-implementation

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the record date and ex-date arrangements
- Public shareholders need to be aware of the severe dilution effect (100:1 consolidation)
- Trading members must note that equity shares remain under trading suspension
- Settlement arrangements to be made as per DR-816/2025-2026

## Important Dates

| February 09, 2026 | Record Date for capital reduction |
| February 09, 2026 | Ex-date for the corporate action |

## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Public Shareholders**: Extremely high negative impact. Public shareholders face severe dilution with a 100:1 share consolidation, meaning they will hold only 1% of their original shareholding count. Shareholders holding fewer than 100 shares may lose their entire holding or receive fractional entitlements.

**Impact on Promoters**: Complete elimination of promoter and promoter group stake as per the resolution plan.

**Market Impact**: Trading remains suspended, so immediate market reaction cannot be observed. This restructuring indicates the company is undergoing insolvency resolution proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

**Corporate Governance**: The resolution plan represents a fundamental restructuring of the company's ownership structure, typically undertaken as part of debt resolution or corporate insolvency proceedings. Post-implementation, the company will have a completely revised shareholding pattern with no original promoter holding.
