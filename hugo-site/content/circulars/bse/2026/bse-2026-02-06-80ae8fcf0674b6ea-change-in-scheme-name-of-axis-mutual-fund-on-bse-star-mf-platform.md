## Summary

Axis Asset Management Company Limited has announced a change in the name of its mutual fund scheme. The Axis US Specific Equity Passive FOF will be renamed to Axis NASDAQ 100 US Specific Equity Passive FOF effective February 06, 2026. This is an administrative change with all other terms and conditions of the Scheme Information Document (SID), Key Information Memorandum (KIM), and Statement of Additional Information (SAI) remaining unchanged.

## Key Points

- All references to the existing name will be replaced with the revised name across all relevant documents
- No changes to scheme terms, conditions, or investment strategy
- Addendum forms an integral part of the SID/KIM and SAI documents
- Notice issued by Gopi Kumar Bhaskaran, Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an administrative update to the scheme name only.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors should note the revised scheme name for all future references and communications
- All scheme documentation will reflect the new name from the Effective Date
- No action required from existing investors as this is purely a nomenclature change

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 02, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 06, 2026
- **Base SAI Date:** June 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This is a low-impact administrative change affecting only the naming convention of the scheme. The name change from "Axis US Specific Equity Passive FOF" to "Axis NASDAQ 100 US Specific Equity Passive FOF" provides more specificity about the underlying index tracked by the fund. There is no impact on:
- Investment strategy or portfolio composition
- Fund management or operations
- Investor holdings or rights
- Terms and conditions of the scheme

Existing investors will continue to hold units in the same scheme under the new name. The change enhances clarity by explicitly mentioning NASDAQ 100 in the scheme name.
