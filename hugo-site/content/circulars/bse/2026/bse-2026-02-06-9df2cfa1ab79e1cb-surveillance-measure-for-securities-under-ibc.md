- **Stage 1**: Additional Surveillance Measure for companies in Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP)
- **Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance for companies in IRP

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 09, 2026 - New surveillance measures come into effect

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities in Stage 1 ASM face additional surveillance including potential price bands, trade-for-trade segments, or additional margins. This may reduce liquidity and increase trading costs for these securities.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these securities should be aware of heightened risks associated with companies under insolvency proceedings. Trading restrictions may limit exit options.

**Market Impact**: Limited broader market impact as this affects only 5 specific securities currently under insolvency proceedings. However, signals continued regulatory monitoring of distressed companies.

## Notes

- Securities marked with ~ are T+0 Scrips, shortlisted in IBC Framework as per parent company
- Securities marked with ^ are Recommencement Scrips
- Consolidated list maintains all securities under IBC surveillance across different stages
