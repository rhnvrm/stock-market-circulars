## Impact Assessment

This is a high-impact OFS given IRFC's status as a major government-backed financing entity for Indian Railways. At a floor price of Rs 104 per share, the base offer represents approximately Rs 2,718 crore in value; including the green shoe option, the total OFS could raise approximately Rs 5,437 crore. The two-day structure (institutional on T day, retail on T+1) is standard for large OFS transactions. Market participants — especially retail investors and their brokers — should prepare for heavy order flow on 26th February. Trading members must ensure systems are configured for both iBBS and RTRMS platforms before the OFS opens.
