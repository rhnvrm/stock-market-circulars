## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Date of Allotment | November 14, 2025 |
| Listing / Trading effective date | February 26, 2026 |
| Lock-in expiry (13,51,308 shares) | July 31, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 13,51,308 new equity shares to UGRO Capital Limited's outstanding share count, marginally diluting existing shareholders. The shares are subject to a lock-in until July 31, 2026, meaning they will not be available for open-market trading until that date, limiting immediate liquidity impact. This is a routine corporate action reflecting the conversion of CCDs held by non-promoter investors. No significant market-wide impact is expected.
