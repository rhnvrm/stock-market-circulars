  Structure Amendment

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular regarding proposed amendments to the security structure governing the debentures of Equinox India Infraestate Limited (formerly Indiabulls Infraestate Limited), scrip code 977168 / ISIN INE741X07077. The amendment restructures the existing pari passu, common-trustee-held security package into a set of first-ranking, issuer-specific security interests held in favour of the Debenture Trustee.

## Key Points

- Issuer: Equinox India Infraestate Limited (formerly Indiabulls Infraestate Limited)
- Scrip Code: 977168 | ISIN: INE741X07077
- The existing security structure comprised first-ranking pari passu charges (shared with Summit Debenture secured parties) over immovable and movable assets held in favour of the Common Security Trustee
- The proposed amendment replaces this with a set of standalone, first-ranking security interests held directly in favour of the Debenture Trustee
- New security package covers the Blu Project and Blu Project Property assets (excluding Excluded Assets)
- Pledge of 99.9997% of fully paid-up equity and voting rights of the Company (fully diluted basis)
- Pledge of 99.9994% of fully paid-up equity and voting rights of Spero (fully diluted basis)
- Contractual comforts via corporate guarantees extended by Spero and HoldCo
- First-ranking security interest over Subordination Receivables (comprising receivables of subordinated loans extended to Spero and the Company)
- Undated cheques issued by HoldCo as additional comfort

## Regulatory Changes

- Security interest transitions from pari passu (shared with Summit Debenture secured parties under a Common Security Trustee) to standalone first-ranking charges under the Debenture Trustee
- Scope of secured assets refocused from broad immovable/movable assets of all Obligors to specific Blu Project assets, equity pledges, and subordination receivables
- Removal of the Common Security Trustee construct; Debenture Trustee now holds security directly
- Summit Project and Summit Project Property are excluded from the new security structure
- HoldCo excluded from movable asset hypothecation under the revised structure

## Compliance Requirements

- Debenture Trustee to update trust deed and security documentation to reflect the new security structure
- Obligors (Company, Spero, HoldCo) to execute revised pledge agreements, guarantee documents, and subordination agreements
- Existing Common Security Trustee arrangements to be unwound and replaced with Debenture Trustee-held security
- Debenture holders / investors to be notified of the material amendment to the security package

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: 27 February 2026
- Effective date of proposed amendment: Not explicitly stated in the circular; subject to requisite approvals and execution of amended transaction documents

## Impact Assessment

- **Debenture Holders:** The restructuring narrows the asset pool securing the debentures to Blu Project assets and equity pledges, removing the broader immovable/movable asset base of all Obligors. This is a material change in credit risk profile and should be evaluated by debenture holders.
- **Security Quality:** Shift to first-ranking (non-pari passu) security interests over specific assets may provide cleaner enforcement rights but reduces diversification of security cover.
- **Equity Pledges:** Near-total pledges (99.9997% of Company; 99.9994% of Spero) provide strong control levers for the Debenture Trustee in a default scenario.
- **Corporate Guarantees:** Addition of guarantees from Spero and HoldCo provides incremental contractual comfort beyond in-rem security.
- **Market Impact:** Limited direct market impact given these are privately placed debt securities; primarily relevant to institutional debenture holders and the Debenture Trustee.
