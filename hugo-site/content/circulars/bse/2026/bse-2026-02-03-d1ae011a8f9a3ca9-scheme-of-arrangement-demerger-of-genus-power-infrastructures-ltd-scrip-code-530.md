## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 3, 2026
- **Record Date:** February 6, 2026
- **Ex-Entitlement Date:** February 6, 2026
- **Settlement Number:** DR-815/2025-2026

- **Special Pre-open Session Date:** February 6, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**For Shareholders:**
Shareholders of Genus Power Infrastructures Ltd as on the record date will receive shares in the newly formed Genus Prime Infra Limited at a ratio of 1:6. This demerger separates the Investment Business Division into a distinct listed entity, potentially unlocking value by allowing separate valuation of the investment business.

**For Trading:**
The transfer to 'T' group (Trade-to-Trade segment) means all transactions will require compulsory delivery, with no intraday trading permitted. This reduces speculative activity during the corporate action period. The Special Pre-open Session will facilitate price discovery through a call auction mechanism on the ex-entitlement date.

**Market Impact:**
The demerger represents a significant corporate restructuring approved by NCLT. Investors will need to assess the valuations of both the demerged entity (Genus Power Infrastructures) and the resulting entity (Genus Prime Infra Limited) separately. The 1:6 ratio means shareholders will receive fewer shares in the new entity, with higher face value per share.
