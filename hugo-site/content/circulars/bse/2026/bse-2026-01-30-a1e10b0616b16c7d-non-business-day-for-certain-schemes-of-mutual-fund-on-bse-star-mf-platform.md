## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational circular with minimal market impact. The non-business days are linked to overseas market holidays where the underlying international funds are traded. Investors in these specific fund-of-funds schemes need to plan their transactions around these dates. The impact is limited to transaction processing timelines and does not affect fund performance or market operations broadly.
