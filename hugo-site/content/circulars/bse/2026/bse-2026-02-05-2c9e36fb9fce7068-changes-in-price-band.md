title: Changes in Price Band for 12 Securities - Effective February 6, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for 12 securities effective February 6, 2026, through Notice No. 20260205-18. The revised bands range from highly restrictive 2% to a more liberal 20%, representing surveillance measures to control volatility and protect investor interests. The changes affect stocks across various sectors including infrastructure, textiles, technology, and manufacturing.

## Key Points

- 12 securities subject to revised price bands effective February 6, 2026
- Price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive)
- Four securities placed under strictest 2% price band: Anirit Ventures, Continental Controls, SVP Global Textiles
- Four securities placed under 5% band: B2B Software Technologies, Dev Labtech Venture, Innovative Ideals and Services, Shreeji Shipping Global
- Three securities placed under 10% band: Genus Prime Infra, Pokarna, Tijaria Polypipes, TTI Enterprise
- One security (Aritas Vinyl) placed under 20% band
- Notice issued by Surveillance Department through Deputy VP Sanjay Jain and Assistant VP Spandan Jayadevulu

## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions represent enhanced surveillance measures under BSE's market monitoring framework. The bands restrict the maximum price movement allowed during a trading session:

- **2% Band**: Anirit Ventures (530705), Continental Controls (531460), SVP Global Textiles (505590) - highest restriction
- **5% Band**: B2B Software Technologies (531268), Dev Labtech Venture (543848), Innovative Ideals and Services (541983), Shreeji Shipping Global (544490)
- **10% Band**: Genus Prime Infra (532425), Pokarna (532486), Tijaria Polypipes (533629), TTI Enterprise (538597)
- **20% Band**: Aritas Vinyl (544683) - least restrictive

These revisions suggest varying levels of surveillance concern across the securities based on trading patterns, volatility, or compliance issues.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must implement revised price bands in their trading systems before market opening on February 6, 2026
- **Risk Management Systems**: Update price band parameters to prevent orders beyond the specified limits
- **Client Communication**: Inform clients about trading restrictions on affected securities
- **Order Management**: Reject or modify orders that exceed the revised price band limits
- **Clarifications**: Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 5, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 6, 2026 (from market opening)
- **Implementation Deadline**: Trading members must ensure compliance before market opening on February 6, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revised price bands will significantly affect trading dynamics for the 12 securities. Stocks under 2% bands will experience severely restricted intraday price movements, potentially reducing liquidity and increasing bid-ask spreads. The 5% and 10% bands represent moderate restrictions that balance volatility control with trading flexibility.

**Liquidity Impact**: Tighter price bands typically reduce trading volumes as price discovery mechanisms are constrained. Day traders and short-term investors may avoid these securities due to limited profit opportunities within narrow bands.

**Investor Protection**: The surveillance measures aim to protect retail investors from excessive volatility and potential price manipulation in securities showing abnormal trading patterns.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members must update their systems urgently to prevent order rejections and client dissatisfaction on the effective date.
