## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The surveillance measure affects 13 securities including major companies like Vedanta Limited and Hindustan Zinc Ltd. High promoter encumbrance can trigger concerns about financial stability, potential margin calls, and involuntary transfer of controlling stakes.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in these securities face elevated risk due to promoter pledges. If pledged shares are invoked due to margin calls or loan defaults, it could lead to change in management control, stock price volatility, and loss of investor confidence.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under this framework may face additional scrutiny, potential trading restrictions, and reduced liquidity. The surveillance status serves as a warning signal for market participants.

**Sectoral Distribution**: The affected companies span infrastructure, power, steel, mining, beverages, and engineering sectors, indicating widespread promoter leverage across industries.

**Risk Factors**: Some securities moved from high encumbrance to other surveillance frameworks (LTASM/STASM), indicating escalation of concerns beyond just encumbrance to broader surveillance criteria including price volatility or corporate governance issues.
