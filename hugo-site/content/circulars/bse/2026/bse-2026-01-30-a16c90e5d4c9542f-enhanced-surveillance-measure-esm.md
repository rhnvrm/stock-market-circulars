title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework - February 2026 Updates
---

## Summary

BSE has announced periodic updates to its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework effective February 01, 2026. The circular identifies securities being newly included in ESM, those moving to higher or lower ESM stages, and those exiting the framework. One security (Colinz Laboratories Ltd) is being newly shortlisted, 2 securities are moving to higher ESM stages, 14 securities are moving to lower ESM stages, and 23 securities are exiting the ESM framework entirely.

## Key Points

- 1 security newly shortlisted in ESM Framework: Colinz Laboratories Ltd (Scrip Code: 531210, ISIN: INE923C01011)
- 2 securities moving to higher ESM stages: Gujarat Inject Kerala Ltd and Sarup Industries Ltd
- 14 securities moving to lower ESM stages including Alps Industries Ltd, Esha Media Research Ltd, GDL Leasing & Finance Ltd, and others
- 23 securities moving out of ESM Framework including Adcon Capital Services Ltd, Essar Shipping Ltd, Systematix Securities Ltd, and others
- Several SME scrips are affected across all categories
- Changes effective from February 01, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework is a graded surveillance mechanism designed to alert investors about securities displaying abnormal price movements or other risk factors. Securities can move through different ESM stages based on market behavior:

- **New ESM Inclusion**: 1 security added to framework surveillance
- **Stage Escalation**: 2 securities moved to higher (stricter) ESM stages due to continued surveillance concerns
- **Stage De-escalation**: 14 securities moved to lower (less strict) ESM stages showing improved market behavior
- **ESM Exit**: 23 securities removed from ESM framework either due to improved compliance or migration to other frameworks (SMP or IBC)

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure awareness of securities under ESM framework
- Enhanced margin requirements and trading restrictions may apply to securities in ESM stages
- Investors should be informed about the surveillance status of these securities
- Securities marked with ($) are moving to Surveillance Measure for Price (SMP) Framework
- Securities marked with (@) are moving to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) Framework
- One security marked with (~) will continue in Trade for Trade as per circular dated January 05, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 01, 2026 - All ESM framework changes become applicable
- **Circular Date**: January 30, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The changes affect 40 securities across different categories, though most are smaller capitalization stocks with limited trading volumes. The ESM framework serves as an investor protection mechanism.

**Trading Impact**: Securities moving to higher ESM stages will face stricter trading conditions including higher margins and potential additional restrictions. Securities exiting ESM will see relaxation of surveillance measures, potentially improving liquidity.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should note the changed surveillance status. Higher ESM stages typically indicate elevated risk and may require additional margins. Exit from ESM is generally positive, indicating improved market behavior.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to update their systems and risk management frameworks to reflect the new ESM classifications effective February 01, 2026.
