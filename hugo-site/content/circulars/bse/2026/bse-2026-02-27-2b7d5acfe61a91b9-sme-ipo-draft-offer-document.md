## Impact Assessment

This circular has a limited and localised market impact, primarily relevant to prospective investors, analysts, and other stakeholders interested in Futurex Management Solutions Limited's upcoming SME IPO. The 21-day public comment period is a standard regulatory step under ICDR Regulations and does not signal immediate trading activity. Broader market impact is low; however, it is a meaningful milestone in the IPO lifecycle of the company on the BSE SME platform.
