title: Changes in Price Band - Three Scrips Revised
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for three equity scrips effective from January 23, 2026. Starlineps Enterprises Ltd and Switching Technologies Gunther Ltd will have their price bands reduced to 2%, while Zenith Steel Pipes & Industries Ltd will have its price band set at 5%. This is a surveillance measure that restricts the daily price movement range for these securities.

## Key Points

- Three scrips affected by price band revisions
- Starlineps Enterprises Ltd (Scrip Code: 540492) - Price band revised to 2%
- Switching Technologies Gunther Ltd (Scrip Code: 517201) - Price band revised to 2%
- Zenith Steel Pipes & Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 531845) - Price band revised to 5%
- Changes effective from January 23, 2026
- Notice issued by BSE Surveillance Department

## Regulatory Changes

The exchange has modified the price band percentages from their existing levels for the specified scrips. Price bands limit the maximum percentage by which a stock can move up or down in a single trading session, serving as a circuit breaker mechanism.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with the revised price bands
- Orders placed outside the revised price band limits will be rejected
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** January 22, 2026
- **Effective Date:** January 23, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The tighter price bands (2% for two scrips and 5% for one scrip) indicate enhanced surveillance measures, likely due to concerns about excessive volatility or price manipulation. This will restrict intraday price movements and may impact liquidity in these securities. Traders and investors should adjust their trading strategies accordingly, as the reduced price bands will limit potential gains or losses within a single trading session.
