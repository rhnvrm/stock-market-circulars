## Regulatory Changes

BSE has expanded its Additional Surveillance Measure framework to include three more securities that have exhibited unusual price movements. This measure is part of the exchange's ongoing efforts to maintain market integrity and protect investors from excessive volatility and potential manipulation.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with additional surveillance requirements for the listed securities
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting obligations may apply
- Investors should be aware of potential trading restrictions including margin requirements, price bands, or circuit filters
- Market participants must adhere to the heightened due diligence standards for transactions in these securities

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: January 9, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 12, 2025 (for newly added securities)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of these three securities to the surveillance list signals regulatory concern about their trading patterns. Investors in these stocks should expect increased scrutiny and potential trading restrictions.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under Additional Surveillance Measure typically face higher margin requirements, reduced position limits, and other trading restrictions designed to curb speculative activity. This may reduce liquidity and increase transaction costs for these securities.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders and prospective investors in the 15 listed securities should exercise heightened caution. The surveillance designation indicates abnormal price movements that may not reflect fundamental value changes. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence before trading in these securities.
