Three securities are being newly added to ESM Stage I: Bhakti Gems and Jewellery Ltd, Pro Clb Global Ltd, and Samtel India Ltd. Additionally, Maruti Interior Products Ltd (SME scrip) will be moved to a higher ESM stage. No securities are moving to lower stages or exiting the ESM framework.

- No securities moving to lower ESM stages
- No securities exiting ESM framework
- Changes effective from January 14, 2026
- Consolidated list contains 29+ securities across ESM stages

## Regulatory Changes

Securities under ESM framework are subject to additional surveillance measures including:
- Trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday trading)
- 100% upfront margin requirements
- Enhanced disclosure obligations
- Price bands and other trading restrictions
- Progressive tightening of measures across ESM stages (I, II, III, etc.)

## Compliance Requirements

- 100% upfront margin collection mandatory from clients
- No facility for carry forward or squared off positions
- Enhanced monitoring of client activities in these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 14, 2026 - ESM framework changes come into effect

## Impact Assessment

**Newly Added Securities (ESM Stage I):**
1. Bhakti Gems and Jewellery Ltd (Scrip Code: 540545, ISIN: INE986W01016)
2. Pro Clb Global Ltd (Scrip Code: 540703, ISIN: INE438C01010)
3. Samtel India Ltd (Scrip Code: 500371, ISIN: INE538C01017)

**Moved to Higher Stage:**
1. Maruti Interior Products Ltd (Scrip Code: 543464, ISIN: INE0JSJ01014) - SME scrip

**Trading Impact:**
- Significant reduction in liquidity for affected securities
- Increased margin requirements may deter speculative trading
- Investors must take delivery of shares, increasing settlement obligations
- Higher ESM stages impose progressively stricter restrictions

**Investor Considerations:**
- Securities in ESM framework indicate heightened regulatory concerns
- May relate to price volatility, low liquidity, corporate governance issues, or other risk factors
- Investors should exercise enhanced due diligence before trading
- Exit from positions may be challenging due to trade-for-trade restrictions

The consolidated list shows securities across multiple ESM stages (Stage I and Stage II), with Stage I being the initial level of enhanced surveillance. The framework is designed to protect investor interests by imposing restrictions on securities exhibiting unusual price movements or other concerning characteristics.
