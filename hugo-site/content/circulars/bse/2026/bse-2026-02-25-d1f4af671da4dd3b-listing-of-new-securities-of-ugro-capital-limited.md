## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed that these securities are now available for trading from February 26, 2026
- The lock-in restriction on all 13,51,308 shares must be observed until July 31, 2026; these shares cannot be traded until the lock-in period expires
- Market participants should update their records to reflect the new distribution numbers (139857829 to 141209136)

- **Date of Allotment:** November 14, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry Date:** July 31, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing of approximately 13.51 lakh new shares expands the total equity capital of UGRO Capital Limited. Since all newly listed shares carry a lock-in until July 31, 2026, there is no immediate increase in tradeable float, limiting short-term market impact. The preferential allotment at Rs. 185 per share via CCD conversion reflects a previously agreed capital restructuring event (allotment dated November 14, 2025). Existing shareholders should note the marginal dilution in equity. Once the lock-in period ends on July 31, 2026, these shares may enter the market and could affect liquidity dynamics.
