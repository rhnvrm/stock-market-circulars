title: Suspension of Trading of Vajra Trust PTCs Effective February 25, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a notice (Notice No. 20260224-15) informing trading members that Axis Trustee Services Limited has notified the Exchange of the redemption of two Pass-Through Certificates (PTCs) issued by Vajra Trust. As a result, trading in these PTCs is suspended with effect from February 25, 2026.

## Key Points

- Axis Trustee Services Limited informed BSE about the redemption of two PTCs under Vajra Trust.
- Two specific PTCs are affected: VT-9.25%-20-10-26-PTC (ISIN: INE20NI15013, Scrip Code: 976743) and VT-9.25%-20-7-26-PTC (ISIN: INE1EJ815016, Scrip Code: 976276).
- Trading members are advised not to deal in these PTCs with effect from February 25, 2026.
- The circular is issued under reference DR-828/2025-2026.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This is an operational notice under existing debt market regulations governing the suspension of trading upon redemption of pass-through certificates.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must immediately cease all dealings in the two Vajra Trust PTCs (Scrip Codes 976743 and 976276) from February 25, 2026 onwards.
- Members must take note of the restriction and ensure no transactions are executed in these instruments post the effective date.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 24, 2026
- **Suspension Effective Date:** February 25, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The suspension is limited in scope, affecting only two specific debt instruments (PTCs) on the BSE Debt Market Segment. Holders of these PTCs should note that trading will no longer be available and the instruments are being redeemed. The broader market impact is minimal given the niche nature of pass-through certificates. Affected parties are primarily institutional investors or trading members holding positions in these specific Vajra Trust PTCs.
