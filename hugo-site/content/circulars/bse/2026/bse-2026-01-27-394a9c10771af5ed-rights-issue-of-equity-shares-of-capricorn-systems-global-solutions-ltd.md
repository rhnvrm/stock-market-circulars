The company is offering 6 new equity shares of Rs.10/- each at par for every 1 existing equity share held. Trading on ex-rights basis commences from January 30, 2026 under settlement number DR-809/2025-2026.

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: January 30, 2026
- **Ex-Rights Date**: January 30, 2026
- **Settlement Number**: DR-809/2025-2026
- **Notice Date**: January 27, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will have the opportunity to acquire 6 additional shares for every share held at Rs.10/- per share. This represents significant dilution if rights are not exercised. The at-par pricing suggests the company is raising capital without offering a discount.

**Trading Impact**: The ex-rights adjustment will affect the stock price starting January 30, 2026. Trading members must ensure proper settlement handling for the dematerialised securities under rolling settlement.

**Market Capitalization Impact**: If fully subscribed, this 6:1 rights issue will expand the equity base by 600%, substantially increasing the company's issued capital and potentially its market capitalization depending on subscription levels.
