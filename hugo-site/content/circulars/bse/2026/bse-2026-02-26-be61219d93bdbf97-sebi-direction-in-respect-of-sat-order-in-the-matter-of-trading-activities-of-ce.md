## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular communicates a SAT interim order modifying the enforcement effect of an existing SEBI debarment direction against specific noticees in the Du Digital Global Limited trading matter.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Appellant (Vyas Jitendrakumar Hasmukhlal HUF):** Must deposit 50% of the penalty amount within four weeks from 13 February 2026 to maintain the stay on debarment.
- **SEBI:** Must file reply within six weeks from 13 February 2026; must place the deposited penalty amount in an interest-bearing account.
- **Market Participants / Brokers:** Should note the conditional reinstatement of trading eligibility for the appellant entities subject to the deposit condition being fulfilled.

## Important Dates

- **13 February 2026:** SAT order date; four-week deposit deadline runs from this date
- **Deposit Deadline (approx. 13 March 2026):** 50% of penalty must be deposited within four weeks of 13 February 2026
- **SEBI Reply Deadline (approx. 27 March 2026):** Six weeks from order date
- **Rejoinder Deadline (approx. 17 April 2026):** Three weeks after SEBI's reply
- **06 May 2026:** Next hearing date before SAT

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to the specific entities involved in this enforcement action. The conditional stay provides temporary relief to the appellant from the one-year debarment, allowing trading activity to resume provided the deposit condition is met. The outcome of the appeal will determine whether the penalty and debarment are upheld, modified, or set aside. Broader market impact on Du Digital Global Limited's scrip is minimal, as the matter pertains to past trading activities of identified entities rather than any ongoing corporate or structural change.
