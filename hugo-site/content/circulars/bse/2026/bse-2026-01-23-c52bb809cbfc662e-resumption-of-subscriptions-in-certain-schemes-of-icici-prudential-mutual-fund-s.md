title: Resumption of Subscriptions in ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund Schemes with Investment
  Limits

## Summary

ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund has announced the resumption of subscriptions in three schemes effective January 27, 2026: ICICI Prudential US Bluechip Equity Fund, ICICI Prudential NASDAQ 100 Index Fund, and ICICI Prudential Strategic Metal and Energy Equity Fund of Fund. Fresh subscriptions will be subject to a cumulative limit of ₹2 lakhs per PAN per month per scheme across all investment modes including lump sum, SIP, STP, and switches. Existing systematic transactions will continue without any limits.

## Key Points

- Subscriptions resume from January 27, 2026 in three schemes: US Bluechip Equity Fund, NASDAQ 100 Index Fund, and Strategic Metal and Energy Equity Fund of Fund
- Monthly investment limit: ₹2 lakhs per PAN per scheme (cumulative across all modes)
- Daily SIP/STP limit: ₹10,000
- Weekly SIP/STP limit: ₹50,000
- Fortnightly SIP limit: ₹1,00,000
- Monthly SIP/STP limit: ₹2,00,000
- Quarterly SIP/STP limit: ₹6,00,000
- Limits apply only to fresh subscriptions/registrations
- Existing systematic transactions continue without any limits
- Special features like Freedom SIP, SIP Top Up, Booster SIP, Flex STP, Booster STP, Capital Appreciation STP, and Trigger facilities are available
- AMC may discontinue subscriptions if overseas investment utilization nears capped limit

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational decision by the Trustee to resume subscriptions with investment caps, likely due to overseas investment limits under RBI/SEBI regulations for mutual funds investing abroad.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors must adhere to the monthly investment limits of ₹2 lakhs per PAN per scheme
- The limits are cumulative across all investment modes (lump sum, SIP, STP, switches)
- Investors should monitor their monthly investments to ensure compliance with the caps
- Investors are requested to periodically review and update their KYC details along with mobile number and email ID

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 21, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 27, 2026 - Resumption of subscriptions with specified limits

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to Medium - The resumption allows new investors to enter these schemes and existing investors to add investments, though with capped limits. The three schemes focus on international equity and commodities exposure.

**Investor Impact**: Medium - Investors seeking fresh exposure to US equities (US Bluechip, NASDAQ 100) and metals/energy sectors can now invest up to ₹2 lakhs per month per scheme. High net-worth investors planning larger investments will need to stagger their investments across multiple months. Existing SIP/STP investors are unaffected and their transactions continue without limits.

**Operational Impact**: The investment caps suggest the fund is managing overseas investment limits prudently while allowing gradual inflows. The AMC retains the right to suspend subscriptions again if overseas investment limits are approached, indicating ongoing monitoring of foreign investment headroom.
