## Impact Assessment

**Options Contracts**: All strike prices generated at the end of February 4, 2026 will have Rs. 5.00 deducted. Adjusted strike prices will be available for trading from February 5, 2026.

**Futures Contracts**: The adjusted futures price will be calculated as reference rate (daily mark-to-market settlement price on February 4, 2026) minus dividend amount of Rs. 5.00. This adjusted rate will serve as the base rate/previous close for trading on February 5, 2026.

**Market Impact**: Traders holding F&O positions in GAIL must account for the Rs. 5.00 adjustment in their pricing models and risk calculations. The adjustment ensures fair pricing post-dividend and prevents arbitrage opportunities between cash and derivative segments.
