## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a routine listing notification for employee stock option exercises.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital for these companies
- Trading members should note the new distinctive numbers for tracking purposes
- No special compliance actions required as shares are freely tradable with no lock-in

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 8, 2026
- **Listing/Trading Effective Date**: January 9, 2026 (Friday)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. ESOP/ESOS listings are routine corporate actions that typically have negligible impact on stock prices or trading volumes. The number of shares issued represents a small fraction of total outstanding equity for each company.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in float for each security. The largest issuance (Ujjivan - 496,366 shares) is small relative to typical daily trading volumes.

**Shareholder Dilution**: Minor dilution effect as these are relatively small issuances compared to existing share capital.
