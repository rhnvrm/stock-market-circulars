## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that Varvee Global Ltd (Scrip Code: 514274) has fixed 02/03/2026 as the Record Date for a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of Rs.10/- face value will be split into two equity shares of Rs.5/- each, effective the same date.

## Key Points

- Company: Varvee Global Ltd (BSE Scrip Code: 514274)
- Record Date: 02 March 2026
- Sub-division ratio: 1 share of Rs.10/- → 2 shares of Rs.5/- each
- New sub-divided paid-up value: Rs.5/- per share, effective 02/03/2026
- Existing ISIN INE273D01019 (Rs.10/- paid-up) will be invalid for exchange transactions on or after 02/03/2026
- New ISIN for Rs.5/- paid-up shares will be communicated via a separate notice
- Reference: DR-831/2025-2026, Notice No. 20260223-20

## Regulatory Changes

The sub-division falls under BSE's corporate actions framework for dematerialised securities in the Rolling Settlement segment. The existing ISIN INE273D01019 is being retired and a new ISIN will be issued to reflect the revised face value of Rs.5/-.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease using ISIN INE273D01019 for exchange transactions on or after 02/03/2026.
- Members should await the separate BSE notice announcing the new ISIN for Rs.5/- paid-up shares and update their systems accordingly.
- Depository participants and back-office systems must be updated to reflect the new face value and ISIN prior to the record date.

## Important Dates

- **23 February 2026**: BSE circular issued (Notice No. 20260223-20)
- **02 March 2026**: Record Date for sub-division; effective date for new Rs.5/- paid-up value
- **02 March 2026 onwards**: Old ISIN INE273D01019 invalid for exchange transactions
- New ISIN announcement: To be communicated by BSE via a separate notice

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action affecting shareholders and trading members dealing in Varvee Global Ltd (Scrip Code: 514274). The stock split doubles the number of shares outstanding while halving the face value, which may improve liquidity for the scrip. The critical operational impact is the mandatory transition to a new ISIN; any trades using the old ISIN after 02/03/2026 will be invalid. Trading members and depositories must complete system updates before the record date to avoid settlement disruptions.
