- Price bands limitations

- Enhanced due diligence required for securities under surveillance measures

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Reduced liquidity for securities newly added to ST-ASM framework
- Higher trading costs due to increased margin requirements

**Investor Impact:**

- Enhanced risk awareness required for trading in surveillance securities

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers need to update risk management systems for affected securities
