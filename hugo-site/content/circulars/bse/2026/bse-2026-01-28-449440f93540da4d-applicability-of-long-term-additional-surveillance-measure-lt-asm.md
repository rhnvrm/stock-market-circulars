## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework continues to be applied as per existing regulations. This circular represents a routine update to the list of securities under surveillance rather than introducing new regulatory changes. The framework involves placing securities under enhanced surveillance with specific trading restrictions based on various risk parameters.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must take note of securities under LT-ASM framework
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in listed securities
- Investors should be aware of additional surveillance measures applicable to these securities
- Trading in these securities subject to specific conditions and restrictions as per ASM framework guidelines
- Members must ensure compliance with margin requirements and trading restrictions for ASM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 29, 2026 - New securities enter LT-ASM framework and all changes become applicable
- **Circular Date**: January 28, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited impact as only 3 securities are newly added to the surveillance framework. The absence of securities moving stages or exiting indicates stability in the surveillance list.

**Trading Impact**: The 3 newly listed securities will face enhanced surveillance measures including potential price bands, 100% margin requirements, and trade-for-trade settlement. This may reduce liquidity and increase trading costs for these specific securities.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading Genesis Ibrc India Ltd, Last Mile Enterprises Ltd, and Atvo Enterprises Ltd should be aware of enhanced surveillance measures. Existing holders should monitor for any further escalation in ASM stages. The measure serves as a caution signal regarding potential concerns with these securities.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to update their systems to reflect ASM applicability for the 3 new securities and ensure appropriate margin collection and settlement procedures.
