title: Discontinuation of Weekly Trading for Suspended Securities - Procal Electronics
  and Satiate Agri
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the discontinuation of weekly trading facility for two companies - Procal Electronics India Ltd (Scrip Code: 526009) and Satiate Agri Ltd (Scrip Code: 524546) - effective February 24, 2026. These companies were previously suspended for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations and were allowed limited trading on Trade for Trade basis in Z group on the first trading day of every week. As the mandated six-month period has been completed, this facility will cease entirely.

## Key Points

- Two companies affected: Procal Electronics India Ltd (526009) and Satiate Agri Ltd (524546)
- Weekly trading facility in Z group on Trade for Trade basis to be discontinued
- Action follows completion of six-month suspension period mandated under SEBI Master Circular
- Original suspension was imposed for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015
- Previous notice (20250708-42) dated July 08, 2025 had initiated the weekly trading arrangement
- Discontinuation aligns with SEBI SOP for suspension and revocation of equity shares

## Regulatory Changes

This action implements the provisions of SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024, specifically Chapter-VII(A) regarding Penal Actions for Non-Compliance. The circular establishes a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for suspension and revocation of equity shares for listed entities that fail to comply with SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note that no trading in these securities will be permitted from February 24, 2026
- The Z group Trade for Trade facility previously available on first trading day of each week will no longer be accessible
- Companies remain suspended until they achieve compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations
- For clarifications, market participants should contact bse.soplodr@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 06, 2026
- **Original Suspension Notice**: July 08, 2025 (Notice No. 20250708-42)
- **Effective Date of Discontinuation**: February 24, 2026
- **Six-Month Period**: Completed as of discontinuation date

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: High - Investors holding shares of Procal Electronics India Ltd and Satiate Agri Ltd will have no trading avenue after February 24, 2026. The discontinuation of even the limited weekly trading facility significantly impacts liquidity and exit options for existing shareholders.

**Market Impact**: Low - Limited to two specific companies with existing compliance issues. No broader market implications.

**Operational Impact**: The complete trading halt escalates the penal action from limited weekly trading to full trading suspension, emphasizing the seriousness of continued non-compliance with listing obligations. Companies must now achieve full compliance to have trading facilities restored.
