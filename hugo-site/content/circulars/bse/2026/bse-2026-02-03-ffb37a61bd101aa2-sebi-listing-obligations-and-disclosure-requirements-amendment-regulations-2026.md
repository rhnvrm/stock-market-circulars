## Summary

SEBI has notified the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations, 2026, which amend the LODR Regulations, 2015. The key change is the revision of the threshold for classification as High Value Debt Listed Entity (HVDLE) from Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 5,000 crore of outstanding non-convertible debt securities. These amendments come into effect from the date of publication in the Official Gazette (January 20, 2026).

## Key Points

- HVDLE threshold increased from Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 5,000 crore of outstanding non-convertible debt securities
- Entities with less than Rs 5,000 crore of listed non-convertible debt securities will no longer be classified as HVDLE
- Regulations 15 to 27 will apply only to entities exceeding the new Rs 5,000 crore threshold
- The proviso ensures entities falling below the revised threshold are no longer subject to HVDLE provisions
- Amendments also made to Regulation 39 regarding investor requests for sub-division, split, consolidation, renewal, exchange, and duplicate securities
- Notification published in the Official Gazette on January 20, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

**Regulation 15 Amendments:**

1. **Sub-regulation (1A):** Modified to increase the HVDLE threshold from Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 5,000 crore for entities with listed non-convertible debt securities

2. **Proviso to Sub-regulation (1A):** Threshold for triggering HVDLE status during a financial year raised from Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 5,000 crore

3. **Explanation (2):** Deleted

4. **Sub-regulation (1AA):** Terminology clarified and a new proviso added stating that provisions will not apply to entities that cease to be HVDLE under the revised threshold of Regulation 15(1A)

**Regulation 39 Amendment:**

Sub-regulation (2) replaced with new provisions regarding processing of investor requests for sub-division, split, consolidation, renewal, exchange of securities, and issuance of duplicate certificates for lost, old, defaced, or mutilated certificates.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Entities Previously Classified as HVDLE (Rs 1,000 crore - Rs 5,000 crore range):**
- No longer required to comply with Regulations 15 to 27 applicable to HVDLE
- Relief from enhanced disclosure and compliance obligations specific to HVDLE

**For Entities Above Rs 5,000 crore:**
- Continue to comply with all HVDLE provisions under Regulations 15 to 27
- Must monitor if outstanding value falls below Rs 5,000 crore during the financial year

**For All Listed Entities:**
- Comply with amended Regulation 39(2) regarding investor service requests
- Review existing processes for handling securities-related investor requests

## Important Dates

- **January 20, 2026:** Notification published in Official Gazette
- **Effective Date:** January 20, 2026 (date of gazette publication)
- **Immediate Impact:** Entities between Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore cease to be HVDLE from effective date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Positive for mid-sized debt issuers who will be relieved from stringent HVDLE compliance requirements
- Reduces regulatory burden for entities with debt securities between Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore
- Focuses enhanced oversight on larger debt issuers (above Rs 5,000 crore)

**Operational Impact:**

- Listed entities need to reassess their regulatory classification and applicable compliance obligations
- Registrars and Transfer Agents must update systems for Regulation 39 compliance

**Investor Impact:**
- Concentrated regulatory scrutiny on higher-value debt issuers may enhance investor protection for larger exposures

**Compliance Impact:**
- Immediate review required by entities near the threshold to determine current classification
- Entities must update internal compliance frameworks based on new classification
- Legal and compliance teams need to assess applicability of various LODR provisions
