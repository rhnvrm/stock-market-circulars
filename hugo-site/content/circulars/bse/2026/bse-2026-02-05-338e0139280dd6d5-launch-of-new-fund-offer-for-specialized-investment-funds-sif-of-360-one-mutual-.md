## Important Dates

- **February 6, 2026**: NFO opening date
- **February 20, 2026**: NFO closing date (extended till midnight for lumpsum purchases)
- **February 24, 2026, 6:00 PM**: Deadline for clear funds in ICCL Account
- **February 25, 2026**: Tentative allotment date
- **T+1 day, 9:00 AM**: Deadline for client fund initiation (else transaction cancelled)
- **T+5 or last payout day, 3:00 PM**: Pending transaction deadline (whichever is earlier)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine NFO announcement for a specialized investment fund. It expands the mutual fund product offerings on BSE StAR MF Platform but does not affect broader market operations or equity trading.

**Operational Impact**: Low to moderate for BSE StAR MF Platform members and distributors who will need to process NFO subscriptions and ensure compliance with fund transfer timelines. The equity long-short strategy is a specialized product likely targeting sophisticated investors.

**Investor Impact**: New investment opportunity for investors seeking alternative investment strategies through the SIF route. The long-short equity strategy allows both long and short positions, differentiating it from traditional equity mutual funds.
