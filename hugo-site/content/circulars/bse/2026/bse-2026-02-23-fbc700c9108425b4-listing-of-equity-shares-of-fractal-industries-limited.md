## Impact Assessment

This is a routine disclosure with no direct market impact beyond providing transparency on ownership structure. The high lock-in ratio (79.31% of total shares) limits near-term floating stock, which may affect liquidity for public shareholders. With only 30.93% of shares in public hands and a significant portion of those also locked in, the effective free float is limited, which is typical for a newly listed company. Investors should note the concentrated promoter ownership and lock-in restrictions before trading.
