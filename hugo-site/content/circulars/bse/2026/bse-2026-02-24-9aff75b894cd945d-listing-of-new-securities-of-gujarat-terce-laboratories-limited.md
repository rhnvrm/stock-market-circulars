- All 3,71,000 shares are subject to a lock-in period until June 16, 2027

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for newly allotted securities pursuant to a preferential issue approved by the company.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed that the new securities are available for trading from February 25, 2026
- The locked-in shares (74,20,301 to 77,91,300) are not available for trading until June 16, 2027

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 3,71,000 shares to the tradable equity base of Gujarat Terce Laboratories Limited (Scrip Code: 524314). However, since all newly listed shares are under a lock-in until June 2027, there is no immediate increase in free-float. Market impact is minimal. The preferential allotment to promoters may slightly increase promoter shareholding percentage.
