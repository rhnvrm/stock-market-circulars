## Summary

BSE has updated the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective January 30, 2026. Ten securities have been newly shortlisted into the ST-ASM framework at Stage I, while seven securities are moving out of the framework.

## Regulatory Framework

The ST-ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities with abnormal price movements and potential risks. Securities under this framework are subject to:

- Enhanced surveillance monitoring
- Potential trading restrictions
- Additional margin requirements
- Staged progression based on continued volatility patterns

Securities can exit ST-ASM by moving to other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge Framework, or ESM) or by normalizing trading behavior.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 30, 2026
- All changes to ST-ASM classification apply from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The changes affect 17 securities with varying market capitalizations. The inclusion of 10 new securities will result in increased trading costs and reduced liquidity for these stocks.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will experience stricter trading conditions, potentially higher margins, and need to exercise additional caution.

**Compliance Impact**: Trading members and brokers must update their risk management systems to reflect the new ST-ASM classifications and ensure appropriate margin collection and client communication.
