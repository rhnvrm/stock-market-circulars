BSE has issued a new ISIN number INE113B01037 for Omega Interactive Technologies Ltd (Scrip Code: 511644) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs.10/- to Re.1/-. The new ISIN will be effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of February 6, 2026. This is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20260128-45 dated January 28, 2026.

## Key Points

- New ISIN number: INE113B01037
- Company: Omega Interactive Technologies Ltd
- Scrip Code: 511644
- Corporate action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Re.1/- (1:10 split)

- Ex-date for new ISIN: February 6, 2026
- Debit reference: DR-815/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action notification following SEBI and BSE guidelines for stock sub-division and ISIN issuance.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to recognize the new ISIN number INE113B01037 for trades from February 6, 2026 onwards
- All market participants must ensure proper mapping of the new ISIN in their trading and settlement systems
- Demat accounts will reflect the sub-divided shares with the new ISIN post ex-date
- Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares of Re.1/- each for every 1 share of Rs.10/- held

## Important Dates

- **February 5, 2026**: Circular issue date
- **February 6, 2026**: Ex-date - New ISIN becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The sub-division (stock split) increases the number of outstanding shares by 10x while reducing the per-share price proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes the stock more accessible to retail investors. The ISIN change is a technical requirement that ensures proper identification of the sub-divided shares in trading and settlement systems.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants must update their systems before the ex-date to ensure seamless processing of trades. Failure to update the ISIN mapping could result in trade rejections or settlement issues. Shareholders will see their holdings adjusted automatically in demat accounts, with 10 new shares replacing each old share.
