## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The listing of ESOP/ESOS securities is a routine corporate action that reflects employee compensation schemes. The number of shares being listed represents a small fraction of the outstanding shares for each company.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible impact on overall liquidity as these shares can be traded immediately without lock-in restrictions.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders may see marginal dilution, but this is typically factored into the company's equity structure and is part of normal employee compensation practices.
