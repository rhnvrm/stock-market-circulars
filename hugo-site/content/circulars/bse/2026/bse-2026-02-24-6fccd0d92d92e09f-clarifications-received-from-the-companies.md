## Summary

BSE Surveillance issued queries to two listed companies — BLS International Services Ltd. (Scrip Code: 540073) and Hind Rectifiers Ltd. (Scrip Code: 504036) — regarding significant increases in trading volume of their securities. Both companies submitted clarifications on February 24, 2026, confirming compliance with SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

- Hind Rectifiers confirms three prior disclosures: board meeting intimation for bonus issue consideration (Feb 5, 2026), outcome of board meeting approving bonus issue (Feb 11, 2026), and postal ballot notice seeking member approval (Feb 17, 2026).
- Both companies reiterate commitment to timely and transparent disclosures under Regulation 30 of SEBI LODR Regulations.

## Impact Assessment

The market impact of this circular is low. Both clarifications are procedural responses to surveillance queries and do not introduce new information that would materially affect either stock. For Hind Rectifiers (BSE: 504036), the volume increase is already explained by the widely disclosed proposed bonus issue, which may continue to attract investor interest.

Investors should monitor for further updates, particularly on the Hind Rectifiers bonus issue approval outcome via postal ballot.
