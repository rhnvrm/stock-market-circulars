## Impact Assessment

This circular has a moderate, company-specific impact. Existing shareholders of Sadhana Nitro Chem Limited who do not wish to subscribe to the Rights Issue can renounce their REs on the Exchange between February 27 and March 5, 2026. Traders and investors can acquire REs during this window to participate in the Rights Issue at the issue price. The trade-for-trade settlement mechanism reduces speculative activity and the T+1 settlement ensures quick transfer of entitlements. REs not acted upon before March 10, 2026 will lapse with no residual value.
