## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The bonus issue of approximately 67.94 crore shares represents a significant increase in the company's issued share capital. This will result in proportional increase in shareholding for all existing shareholders while maintaining their ownership percentage.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive additional shares without any cash outlay, increasing their absolute number of shares held. The stock price will adjust proportionally on the ex-bonus date.

**Liquidity Impact**: The substantial increase in share count is expected to improve stock liquidity and may make the stock more accessible to retail investors due to potentially lower absolute price per share post-adjustment.

**Trading Considerations**: Market participants should account for the capital restructuring when analyzing price movements and volumes from January 15, 2026 onwards.
