## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to debt segment participants holding or trading commercial paper of the 13 specified issuers. No impact on equity markets or other debt instruments.

**Investor Impact**: Holders of these commercial paper instruments will receive redemption proceeds as per the fixed record dates. Secondary market liquidity ceases from suspension dates.

**Operational Impact**: Trading desks must update their systems to block trading in the 13 ISINs from respective dates. Relatively routine operational adjustment for debt market participants.

**Issuer Profile**: Mix of financial services companies (Manappuram, Bajaj Financial Securities, DSP Finance, Nuvama, Godrej entities, Infina, Capri Global, 360 ONE) and industrial corporates (Bombay Burmah, Jamnagar Utilities, J.K. Cement, Tata Steel), indicating diverse sectoral exposure in commercial paper redemptions.
