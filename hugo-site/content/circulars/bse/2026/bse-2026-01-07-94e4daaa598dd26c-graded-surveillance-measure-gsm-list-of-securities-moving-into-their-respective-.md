## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of four securities into different stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. Three securities - Quadrant Televentures Ltd, Worldwide Aluminium Ltd, and ANS Industries Ltd - are moving to GSM Stage II, while Rajasthan Tube Manufacturing Company Ltd is moving to GSM Stage III, which represents a higher level of surveillance.

## Key Points

- Quadrant Televentures Ltd (Security Code: 511116, ISIN: INE527B01020) moved to GSM Stage II
- Worldwide Aluminium Ltd (Security Code: 526525, ISIN: INE550D01010) moved to GSM Stage II
- ANS Industries Ltd (Security Code: 531406, ISIN: INE234J01018) moved to GSM Stage II
- Rajasthan Tube Manufacturing Company Ltd (Security Code: 530253, ISIN: INE497E01020) moved to GSM Stage III
- Securities marked with (#) can move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- Securities marked with ($) can move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in IBC Framework

## Regulatory Changes

The movement to higher GSM stages involves increased surveillance and trading restrictions. Stage II typically involves higher margins and more frequent position monitoring, while Stage III represents even stricter surveillance measures including potential additional price bands and trade-for-trade settlement.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with enhanced margin requirements for securities in GSM Stage II and III
- Investors should be aware of the increased surveillance status when trading these securities
- Market participants must adhere to any additional trading restrictions applicable to securities under GSM

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: January 7, 2026
- The GSM stage changes are effective as per the circular date

## Impact Assessment

The movement of these securities to higher GSM stages indicates concerns regarding price volatility, trading patterns, or other market parameters. Investors in these securities will face higher margin requirements and potential liquidity constraints. Stage III classification for Rajasthan Tube Manufacturing Company Ltd represents the most significant surveillance level among the listed securities, which may substantially impact trading volumes and investor participation in this stock.
