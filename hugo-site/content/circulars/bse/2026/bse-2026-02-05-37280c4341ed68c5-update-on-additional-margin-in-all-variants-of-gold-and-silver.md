title: Update on Additional Margin in All Variants of Gold and Silver
---

## Summary

Indian Clearing Corporation Limited (ICCL) has issued a modification to circular 20260128-2 announcing phased increases in additional margins for all variants of Gold and Silver futures contracts. The margins will be increased in two stages: February 5, 2026 (beginning of day) and February 6, 2026 (beginning of day). This measure is part of periodic review of risk management adequacy to mitigate systemic risk.

## Key Points

- Additional margin on Gold futures (all variants) increased to 1.00% effective February 5, 2026 (BOD)
- Additional margin on Silver futures (all variants) increased to 4.50% effective February 5, 2026 (BOD)
- Further increase to 3.00% for Gold futures effective February 6, 2026 (BOD)
- Further increase to 7.00% for Silver futures effective February 6, 2026 (BOD)
- Applies to all variants of Gold and Silver futures contracts
- Circular modifies previous ICCL circular 20260128-2 dated January 2, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

ICCL is implementing enhanced margin requirements as part of its authority under Rules, Bye-laws, and Regulations to conduct periodic reviews of risk management measures. The phased approach allows market participants time to adjust positions and capital allocation.

## Compliance Requirements

- All clearing members and participants must ensure adequate margin coverage for Gold and Silver futures positions
- Members must adjust their capital and margin calculations to account for the increased requirements
- Contact ICCL Risk Department (risk.monitoring@icclindia.com or +91-22-2272 5186/8902) for clarifications

## Important Dates

- **February 5, 2026 (BOD)**: First phase - Gold 1.00%, Silver 4.50% additional margin
- **February 6, 2026 (BOD)**: Second phase - Gold 3.00%, Silver 7.00% additional margin

## Impact Assessment

**Capital Impact**: Members holding Gold and Silver futures positions will need to allocate significantly higher margins - a 200% increase for Gold (from 1% to 3%) and 55% increase for Silver (from 4.5% to 7%) over the two-day period.

**Trading Impact**: Higher margin requirements may reduce leverage availability and could lead to position adjustments or liquidations if participants cannot meet the enhanced margin calls.

**Market Impact**: The phased implementation aims to minimize market disruption, but increased margins typically reduce trading volumes and volatility in affected contracts as participants reduce positions to manage capital efficiency.
