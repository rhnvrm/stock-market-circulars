title: Changes in Price Band for 30 Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 30 securities effective January 19, 2026. The revised bands range from 2% to 20%, down from regular trading bands, as part of surveillance measures. The changes affect companies across various sectors including technology, textiles, infrastructure, and financial services.

## Key Points

- 30 securities will have revised price bands effective January 19, 2026
- Price bands reduced to 2%, 5%, 10%, or 20% depending on the security
- Four securities (Kinetic Trust, Nagpur Power & Industries, Trade Wings, Vipul) restricted to 2% band
- Seven securities (Escorp Asset Management, Nagreeka Capital & Infrastructure, Omnitex Industries) have 20% band
- Majority of securities (14 stocks) placed under 5% price band
- Changes implemented as surveillance measure by BSE

## Regulatory Changes

BSE Surveillance Department has imposed tighter price bands on these securities, restricting the maximum daily price movement from the standard bands. This is a regulatory measure to control excessive volatility and protect investors in securities under enhanced monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands from January 19, 2026
- Orders exceeding the specified price bands will be rejected
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 16, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 19, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The revised price bands will limit intraday price volatility for these 30 securities. Traders and investors in these stocks will face restrictions on daily price movements, potentially reducing speculative trading activity. The tightest 2% bands on four securities indicate heightened surveillance concerns. This measure aims to protect investors but may reduce liquidity and trading volumes in affected securities.
