The revised price bands are part of BSE's surveillance measures to manage volatility and trading activity in these securities.

## Regulatory Changes

This circular represents a surveillance-driven adjustment to price bands for specific securities. Price bands are regulatory tools used by exchanges to limit maximum price movement within a trading session, helping to control excessive volatility and protect investors from extreme price fluctuations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement the revised price bands in their trading systems before market opening on February 3, 2026
- All trades in the affected securities must comply with the new price band limits
- Trading members should inform their clients about the revised price bands for these securities
- Any queries or clarifications should be directed to the Surveillance department at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 2, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 3, 2026
- The revised price bands will be applicable from the market opening on February 3, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The price band revisions will affect trading dynamics in these seven securities. Tighter bands (2% and 5%) will limit intraday price movement, potentially reducing volatility but also limiting trading opportunities. Wider bands (10%) allow for greater price discovery but may indicate higher volatility expectations.

**Trading Impact**: 
- Mukat Pipes Ltd with a 2% band faces the most restrictive trading environment, suggesting heightened surveillance concerns
- Biofil Chemicals and United Foodbrands with 10% bands have more flexibility for price movement
- Five securities have moderate 5% bands, balancing volatility control with price discovery

**Investor Impact**: Investors and traders in these securities should be aware of the revised limits on daily price movements. Day traders and short-term investors may find reduced opportunities in securities with tighter bands, while the changes reflect BSE's ongoing surveillance and risk management activities.
