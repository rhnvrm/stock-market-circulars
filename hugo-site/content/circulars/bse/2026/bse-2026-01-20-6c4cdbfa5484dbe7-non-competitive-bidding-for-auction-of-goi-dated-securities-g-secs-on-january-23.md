## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine G-sec auction announcement that provides market participants an opportunity to invest in government securities through the non-competitive bidding route.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and direct investors need to ensure timely bid submission through the designated platform. The staggered deadlines (direct investors by Jan 22 at 5 PM, members by Jan 23 at 8 AM) require operational coordination.

**Participant Impact**: Provides retail and institutional investors access to participate in government securities auctions without competing on yield, as allocations under non-competitive bidding are made at the weighted average yield of competitive bids. The ₹2 crore maximum limit per security makes this suitable primarily for smaller investors and retail participants.

**Contact Support**: BSE has provided dedicated support contacts for user ID creation (Trading Operations: 022-2272 8005/8215), bidding queries (022-2272 8376/5626/8226), and settlement queries (ICCL Operations: 022-2272 8468/8704/8264).
