## Compliance Requirements

- Members with delivery shortages must participate in the demat auction for the listed scrips
- Settlement must be completed as per BSE's standard auction settlement procedures

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 87 scrips with varying quantities. The exceptionally high volume in Tilak Ventures Limited (nearly 6 million shares) indicates significant delivery failure for that scrip, which may cause price volatility during auction settlement.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Brokers and clearing members with open positions in these scrips must arrange for auction settlement, potentially at higher prices than the original trade price.

**Liquidity Impact:** The diverse range of companies affected (from large caps like HCL Tech and JSW Steel to smaller companies) suggests widespread but relatively small delivery issues across the market. The auction mechanism will provide liquidity to complete these settlements.

**Notable Concerns:** The massive quantity of Tilak Ventures shares requiring auction settlement (5.99 million shares) is unusually high and may indicate significant operational or liquidity issues specific to that scrip.
