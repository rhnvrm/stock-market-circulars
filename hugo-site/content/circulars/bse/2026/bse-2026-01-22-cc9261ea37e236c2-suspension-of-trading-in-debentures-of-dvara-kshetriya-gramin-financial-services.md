## Important Dates

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| January 22, 2026 | Circular issued |

| February 2, 2026 | Trading suspension begins (no dealings from this date) |

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium - The trading suspension affects a specific private limited company's debt instrument with limited market participation. The suspension is temporary and relates to a scheduled redemption process.

**Investor Impact**: Medium - Debenture holders will receive their interest payment and redemption proceeds as per the record date. However, liquidity is eliminated from the suspension date, preventing any secondary market transactions.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Standard corporate action procedure that trading members routinely handle. The early maturity redemption (before December 2026 maturity) indicates the company is meeting its debt obligations.

**Credit Implications**: Neutral to positive - The redemption demonstrates the issuer's ability to honor debt commitments, which is favorable for credit assessment.
