title: Discontinuation of Fresh Subscription on Systematic Registration under Certain
  Schemes of Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund
---

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund has issued Addendum No. 09/2026 announcing the suspension of fresh subscriptions and switch-in applications for three international equity schemes effective February 10, 2026. The suspension includes fresh registrations under Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and Systematic Transfer Plan (STP). However, existing SIP/STP registrations made prior to the effective date will continue to be processed.

## Key Points

- Fresh subscription and switch-in applications will be discontinued from February 10, 2026
- Applications received post cutoff timing on the effective date will not be processed
- No fresh registrations under SIP and STP will be accepted from the effective date
- No units will be allotted under SIP and STP falling on or after February 10, 2026
- Existing SIP/STP installments registered before the effective date will continue to be processed
- Three schemes affected: Aditya Birla Sun Life International Equity Fund, Global Emerging Opportunities Fund, and Global Excellence Equity Fund of Fund
- Changes will be reflected in the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)

## Regulatory Changes

The Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) of the three affected schemes will be updated to reflect the suspension of fresh subscriptions and systematic registrations. This addendum forms an integral part of the SID and KIM issued for the schemes. All other features and terms & conditions remain unchanged.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investment Manager: Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited must update all scheme-related documents
- Distributors and platforms must stop accepting fresh subscription applications for the three schemes from February 10, 2026
- Existing SIP/STP mandates registered before the effective date must continue to be honored
- New SIP/STP registration requests received on or after the effective date must be rejected
- Standard mutual fund disclaimer applies: "Mutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully"

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: February 9, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 10, 2026 (Tuesday)
- **Cutoff**: Applications received post cutoff timing on February 10, 2026 will not be processed
- **SIP/STP Impact**: No fresh registrations from February 10, 2026; existing registrations continue

## Impact Assessment

**Affected Schemes:**
1. Aditya Birla Sun Life International Equity Fund
2. Aditya Birla Sun Life Global Emerging Opportunities Fund
3. Aditya Birla Sun Life Global Excellence Equity Fund of Fund

**Investor Impact:**
- New investors will not be able to enter these three schemes through fresh subscriptions or switch-ins
- Investors with existing SIP/STP registrations can continue their systematic investments without disruption
- No impact on redemptions or switches to other schemes (not mentioned as restricted)
- Likely indicates the fund house is limiting inflows due to capacity constraints or portfolio management considerations in international equity exposure

**Market Impact:**
- Limited to mutual fund distribution channels
- No direct impact on equity market trading or BSE operations
- May indicate fund management strategy to manage AUM in international equity schemes
- Investors seeking international equity exposure through these specific schemes will need to explore alternative funds
