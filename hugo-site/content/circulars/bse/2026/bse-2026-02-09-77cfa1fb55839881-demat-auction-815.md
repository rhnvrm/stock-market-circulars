## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 445+ securities with varying quantities. While the number of scrips is significant, most quantities are relatively small except for a few outliers. This suggests localized settlement issues rather than systemic market stress.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Members with short positions in the listed securities must participate in the auction, which may result in higher procurement costs compared to regular market prices. Securities with large auction quantities (Tourism Finance, Welcure Drugs, BHEL, Hindustan Copper) may experience temporary price volatility.

**Liquidity Impact:** Low to Medium - For highly liquid large-cap stocks (ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Tata Motors, ITC), the auction quantities are minimal relative to average daily volumes. However, for small-cap and illiquid securities, even small auction quantities could impact local price discovery.

**Systemic Risk:** Low - This is a routine settlement mechanism and does not indicate systemic settlement failures or broader market stress.
