title: Revision of Price Bands for 17 Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 17 securities effective February 10, 2026, as part of surveillance measures. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20%, significantly restricting daily price movements for these scrips. This action is typically taken to curb excessive volatility and protect investor interests in securities that may be subject to speculative trading.

## Key Points

- 17 securities affected by price band revisions
- Changes effective from February 10, 2026
- Price bands revised to 2%, 5%, 10%, or 20% based on individual scrip assessment
- Strictest band (2%) applied to 5 companies: Gujarat Investa Ltd, Indian Link Chain Manufacturers Ltd, Oxford Industries Ltd, S.A.L. Steel Ltd, and Tirth Plastic Ltd
- Widest band (20%) applied to Digilogic Systems Ltd
- Members can seek clarifications at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

Price band restrictions have been modified from existing levels for surveillance purposes. The new bands limit the maximum daily price movement (up or down) to the specified percentage from the previous day's closing price.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands effective February 10, 2026
- Orders exceeding the specified price band will be rejected
- Members should update their trading systems to reflect new price band limits
- Any clarifications required should be directed to BSE Surveillance department

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 9, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 10, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The revised price bands will restrict intraday volatility in the affected securities, limiting trading opportunities but providing stability. Securities with 2% bands will have highly restricted price movements, which may impact liquidity.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding these securities will experience limited price discovery and reduced volatility. This protects against sudden adverse price movements but may also restrict gains.

**Trading Impact:** Day traders and short-term traders will find reduced opportunities in these scrips. The tighter bands suggest these securities are under enhanced surveillance, potentially due to unusual price movements, low liquidity, or corporate governance concerns.
