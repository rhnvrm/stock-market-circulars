## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine corporate action affecting only Yug Decor Limited. The 56% increase in market lot size (from 3,450 to 5,175) will require higher capital commitment per lot for traders.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their trading systems to accommodate the new market lot. Existing shareholders who participated in the rights issue will see their holdings increase, maintaining their proportional ownership.

**Liquidity Impact**: The increased market lot size may marginally affect liquidity by raising the minimum investment threshold for trading in round lots.
