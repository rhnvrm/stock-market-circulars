## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date and ex-date for the unit split
- Systems should be updated to reflect the new face value from February 13, 2026
- Members should await separate notice regarding new ISIN number for the split face value
- All trading in QUANTUM NIFTY 50 ETF units must reflect the new Re. 01/- face value from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: February 13, 2026
- **Ex-Date**: February 13, 2026
- **Trading with New Face Value Begins**: February 13, 2026
- **Settlement Number**: DR-820/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The unit split will increase the number of units proportionally while maintaining the same overall investment value for existing unitholders. The lower face value (Re. 01/-) may make the ETF more accessible to retail investors and improve liquidity.

**Operational Impact**: Medium. Trading members and market participants need to update their systems to reflect the new face value and await the new ISIN number. The 1:10 split ratio means unitholders will receive 10 units for every 1 unit held.

**Investor Impact**: Neutral to positive. While the total investment value remains unchanged, the lower face value and increased unit count may provide better flexibility for trading and portfolio management.
