---

## Summary

BSE has published the demat auction list for Settlement No. 801 dated January 20, 2026. The circular lists securities across multiple scrips that are available for auction to cover shortages in demat delivery obligations. The auction includes quantities ranging from 1 share to over 55,000 shares across approximately 87 different securities.

## Key Points

- Settlement Number: 801
- Auction Date: January 20, 2026
- Total securities listed: Approximately 87 different scrips
- Quantity range: From 1 share to 55,046 shares (Teamo Produc)
- Largest quantities: Teamo Produc (55,046 shares), Murae Organi (10,854 shares), AMD INDUSTRI (6,500 shares), MUKAT PIPES (3,707 shares)
- Notable stocks included: RELIANCE IND (26 shares), INFOSYS LTD (1 share), ICICI BANK L (2 shares), STATE BANK O (1 share), INDIAN OIL C (1 share)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a routine operational circular for demat auction settlement.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members with short deliveries must participate in the auction process
- Settlement obligations must be fulfilled through the auction mechanism for listed securities
- Participants must follow BSE's standard auction procedures and timelines for Settlement No. 801

## Important Dates

- **Auction Date:** January 20, 2026
- **Settlement No.:** 801

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational circular with minimal market impact. The demat auction mechanism is a standard process to resolve delivery shortages in the settlement cycle. The impact is limited to:

- Trading members with outstanding delivery obligations in the listed securities
- Potential minor price volatility in the specific securities during auction
- No systemic market impact expected

The quantities involved are relatively small for most securities, indicating normal settlement operations. Large institutional stocks like Reliance, Infosys, and ICICI Bank have minimal quantities (1-26 shares), suggesting isolated delivery failures rather than widespread settlement issues.
