## Summary

BSE has notified trading members to stop dealing in partly paid equity shares (Scrip Code 890224) of LLOYDS ENTERPRISES LIMITED effective January 16, 2026. The restriction is imposed to determine shareholders eligible to receive call notice for payment of First and Final call money of Rs. 19.50 per partly paid share (Rs. 0.50 towards face value and Rs. 19/- as premium).

## Key Points

- Record date fixed for January 16, 2026
- No dealings permitted from January 16, 2026 (Settlement No. DR-800/2025-2026)
- Applies only to partly paid equity shares (Scrip Code 890224)
- Call amount: Rs. 19.50 per partly paid share (Rs. 0.50 face value + Rs. 19/- premium)
- Purpose: To identify shareholders eligible for First and Final call notice
- Trading members must comply with this restriction

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action procedure for call money collection on partly paid shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must immediately cease all dealings in partly paid equity shares of LLOYDS ENTERPRISES LIMITED from January 16, 2026
- Members must ensure their systems and processes prevent trading in the specified scrip code (890224)
- Only partly paid equity shares are affected; fully paid shares (if any) remain unaffected

## Important Dates

- **January 9, 2026**: Circular issued
- **January 16, 2026**: Record date and commencement of no-dealings period
- **Settlement No.**: DR-800/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of partly paid equity shares of LLOYDS ENTERPRISES LIMITED. Trading suspension affects liquidity for shareholders wanting to exit before call payment obligation.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update systems to block transactions in scrip code 890224. Shareholders holding partly paid shares must prepare for call payment of Rs. 19.50 per share or risk forfeiture.

**Financial Impact**: Shareholders must arrange funds for call payment. The call includes both face value completion (Rs. 0.50) and premium (Rs. 19/-), representing significant additional investment obligation for partly paid shareholders.
