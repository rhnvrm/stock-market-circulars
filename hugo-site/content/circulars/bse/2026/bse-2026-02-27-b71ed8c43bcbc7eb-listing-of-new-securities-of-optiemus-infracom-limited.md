## Important Dates

| Event | Date |

| Lock-in Expiry | September 10, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

The listing of 3,04,291 new shares represents a modest equity dilution for existing shareholders of Optiemus Infracom Limited. As the shares are allotted to Non-Promoters at a premium of Rs. 662.25/- (issue price Rs. 672.25/-), the transaction reflects market confidence at that valuation. The lock-in until September 10, 2026 limits immediate selling pressure from the newly allotted shares. Overall market impact is limited and routine in nature.
