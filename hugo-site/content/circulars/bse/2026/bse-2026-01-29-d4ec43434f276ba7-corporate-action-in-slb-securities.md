## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium impact on SLB market operations. Participants with positions in the affected 10 securities must plan for temporary restrictions on lending and borrowing activities. The Genus Power Infrastructures spin-off requires mandatory foreclosure, which may force position unwinding. Dividend-related shut periods are routine but require operational adjustments for active SLB traders. Market liquidity in these securities' SLB segment may be affected during the respective shut periods.
