---

## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in specific Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of Piramal Finance Limited effective February 6, 2026. The suspension is being implemented as the company has fixed the record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the no-dealings date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspended for Piramal Finance Limited debentures (Series: PFL-3MOIS SPREAD-23-2-26-PVT)
- ISIN: INE516Y07535 (Code: 976348)
- Record date set for February 6, 2026
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- No dealings permitted from February 6, 2026
- Circular reference: DR-815/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action notification requiring temporary trading suspension as per existing BSE procedures for debt securities undergoing redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from February 6, 2026
- Trading members must inform their clients holding these debentures about the suspension
- Members should update their trading systems to prevent inadvertent transactions in the suspended security

## Important Dates

- **January 30, 2026**: Circular issued by BSE
- **February 6, 2026**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **February 6, 2026**: No dealings date - trading suspension begins

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited impact as suspension affects only a specific series of privately placed debentures of Piramal Finance Limited. The suspension is temporary and related to scheduled corporate action.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will receive redemption proceeds and interest as per the terms. No trading opportunity available from the no-dealings date, but this is standard procedure for securities approaching maturity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure compliance systems are updated to block trades in the specified ISIN. Minimal operational burden as this is a routine corporate action.
