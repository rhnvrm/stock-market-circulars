## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Trading in REs commences | March 2, 2026 (Monday) |

| Rights Issue opens | March 2, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a focused, company-specific impact. Existing shareholders of Padam Cotton Yarns Limited who received Rights Entitlements may trade (renounce) them on BSE between March 2 and March 4, 2026. Investors who purchase REs should be aware these are instruments tied to the rights issue and not ordinary equity shares. The T+1 trade-for-trade settlement mechanism reduces counterparty risk. REs that remain unrenounced and unsubscribed by March 9, 2026 will be extinguished, making timely action essential for RE holders.
