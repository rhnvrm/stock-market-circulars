## Summary

BSE has issued a no-dealings directive for two series of non-convertible debentures issued by SAKTHI FINANCE LTD., effective February 12, 2026. The suspension is implemented ahead of the record date set for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are prohibited from dealing in these securities from the specified date.

## Key Points

- Two NCD series of SAKTHI FINANCE LTD. affected by trading suspension
- SFL-9%-27-2-26-NCD (ISIN: INE302E07607, Code: 939268)
- SFL-27-2-26-NCD (ISIN: INE302E07615, Code: 939270)
- Record date set for February 12, 2026
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Notice reference: DR-819/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action procedure where trading is suspended ahead of redemption to freeze the register of debenture holders entitled to receive redemption proceeds and final interest payment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the specified debentures from February 12, 2026
- All market participants must cease trading activities in both NCD series (codes 939268 and 939270)
- Trading members required to take note of the suspension and comply with no-dealings directive
- Ensure client orders are not accepted for these securities from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 02, 2026
- **Record Date:** February 12, 2026
- **No Dealings From:** February 12, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - Complete trading suspension affects liquidity for debenture holders who may want to exit positions before redemption. Investors holding these debentures will not be able to trade them from February 12, 2026 onwards.

**Investor Impact:** High - Debenture holders must make decisions before the suspension date. Post-suspension, investors will need to wait for redemption proceeds and final interest payment. The suspension marks the final stage of these debt instruments' lifecycle.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading members need to update their systems to block orders for these specific ISINs/scrip codes and inform clients holding these debentures about the impending suspension and redemption.
