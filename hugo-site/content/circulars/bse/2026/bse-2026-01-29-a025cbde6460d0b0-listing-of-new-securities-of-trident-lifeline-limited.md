**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a relatively small preferential allotment representing warrant conversion by promoters. The lock-in period until August 31, 2027 ensures these shares will not impact immediate market supply.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible impact on liquidity given the small number of shares and promoter lock-in.

**Investor Impact:** Neutral for existing shareholders. The preferential issue to promoters may indicate confidence but involves minimal dilution. The shares rank pari-passu with existing equity, preserving shareholder rights.
