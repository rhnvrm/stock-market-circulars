## Summary

BSE has announced the listing of 42,00,000 new equity shares of ERAAYA LIFESPACES LIMITED (Scrip Code: 531035) issued to promoters on a preferential basis. The shares are listed and permitted to trade on the Exchange effective from Wednesday, January 28, 2026. These shares were allotted on December 26, 2025, at an issue price of Rs. 81/- per share (face value Re. 1/- with a premium of Rs. 80/-) and are subject to lock-in until July 30, 2027.

## Key Points

- Company: ERAAYA LIFESPACES LIMITED
- Scrip Code: 531035
- Number of shares: 42,00,000 equity shares
- Face value: Re. 1/- per share
- Issue price: Rs. 81/- per share (including premium of Rs. 80/-)
- Allotment basis: Preferential allotment to promoters
- Date of allotment: December 26, 2025
- ISIN: INE432F01032
- Distinctive Numbers: 190694161 to 194894160
- Ranking: Pari-passu with existing equity shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification for preferentially allotted shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities listing
- Lock-in restrictions must be observed for all 42,00,000 shares until July 30, 2027
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares for all purposes

## Important Dates

- **December 26, 2025**: Date of allotment
- **January 28, 2026**: Trading commencement date
- **July 30, 2027**: Lock-in expiry date

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. The preferential allotment represents an increase in share capital issued to promoters at a significant premium (Rs. 80/- over face value of Re. 1/-). The extended lock-in period until July 30, 2027, means these shares will not be available for trading in the near term, preventing immediate dilution effects. This is a routine corporate action typical of companies raising capital through preferential allotments to promoter groups.
