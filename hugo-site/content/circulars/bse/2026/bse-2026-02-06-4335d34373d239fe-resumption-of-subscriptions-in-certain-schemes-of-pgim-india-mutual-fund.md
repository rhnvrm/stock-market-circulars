title: Resumption of subscriptions in certain schemes of PGIM India Mutual Fund
---

## Summary

PGIM India Asset Management has reopened subscriptions in three international fund of funds schemes effective February 06, 2026, following SEBI's permission to accept investments within available overseas investment headroom. The schemes were previously suspended on December 10, 2025. Fresh investments are permitted with a maximum limit of INR 5,00,000 per day, per investor, per scheme at the primary holder PAN level.

## Key Points

- Subscriptions reopened for PGIM India Global Equity Opportunities Fund of Fund, PGIM India Emerging Markets Equity Fund of Fund, and PGIM India Global Select Real Estate Securities Fund of Fund
- Effective date: February 06, 2026
- Transaction limit: Maximum INR 5,00,000 per day, per investor, per scheme (at Primary holder PAN level)
- Permitted transactions: Fresh SIP/Systematic Transfer Plan, Switch-ins, and Lumpsum investments
- Previous suspension was announced on December 10, 2025
- Reopening follows SEBI letter no. SEBI/HO/OW/IMD-II/DoF3/P/25095/2022 dated June 17, 2022

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has permitted Mutual Funds to accept subscriptions and invest in overseas funds/securities up to the headroom available without breaching the overseas investment limits as of end of day February 1, 2022 at Mutual Fund level. This regulatory framework allows controlled resumption of international fund investments while maintaining overall investment limits.

## Compliance Requirements

- Unit holders must update PAN, KYC, email address, mobile number, and nominee details with the AMC
- Unit holders are advised to link their PAN with Aadhaar Number
- Investors should check the Investor Charter available on the Mutual Fund website
- Investors should verify any unclaimed redemptions or Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) payments
- All transactions must comply with the daily limit of INR 5,00,000 per investor per scheme at PAN level
- Transactions must be received before cut-off time on any business day

## Important Dates

- **February 06, 2026**: Effective date for resumption of subscriptions in the three designated schemes
- **December 10, 2025**: Date of previous suspension notice
- **June 17, 2022**: SEBI permission letter date allowing controlled overseas investments
- **February 1, 2022**: Reference date for overseas investment limit calculation (EOD)
- **February 05, 2026**: Notice issuance date

## Impact Assessment

The reopening provides limited access to international equity and real estate investment opportunities for retail investors through fund of funds structures. The INR 5 lakh daily limit per scheme ensures controlled fund flows while preventing breaches of overseas investment caps. This measured approach balances investor access with regulatory compliance. The impact is primarily positive for investors seeking geographic diversification, though the transaction limits may require staggered investments for larger allocation plans. The three schemes cover distinct international markets (global equities, emerging markets, and global real estate), providing diversification options within the constraints of India's overseas investment framework.
