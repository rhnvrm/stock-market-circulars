The REs (Scrip Code: 751090, Scrip ID: ONIX-RE, ISIN: INE173M20012) will trade in dematerialized form only and settle on a T+1 rolling, trade-for-trade basis.

- Rights Issue open period: February 26, 2026 to March 06, 2026

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform all clients about the commencement of RE trading, specifying the ISIN (INE173M20012) and clarifying that REs are not ordinary shares of the company
- Contract notes/bills for RE purchases must prominently include a disclaimer stating that purchasing REs only grants the right to participate in the ongoing Rights Issue or to renounce the REs before the issue closes
- Members must ensure clients are aware that unsubscribed and un-renounced REs will lapse after the Issue Closing Date

## Important Dates

- **February 26, 2026**: Commencement of RE trading; Rights Issue opens
- **March 02, 2026**: Last day for trading/renunciation of Rights Entitlements
- **March 06, 2026**: Rights Issue closes; deadline for subscription or renunciation
- REs neither subscribed nor renounced by March 06, 2026 will be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a limited and localized market impact, affecting only existing shareholders of ONIX SOLAR ENERGY LIMITED and investors seeking to participate in or renounce rights entitlements. The short trading window (February 26 to March 02, 2026) requires prompt action from eligible shareholders. The trade-for-trade settlement mechanism reduces speculative activity, and the demat-only restriction ensures transparency. Lapsing of unexercised REs post March 06, 2026 is a standard risk that shareholders should be aware of.
