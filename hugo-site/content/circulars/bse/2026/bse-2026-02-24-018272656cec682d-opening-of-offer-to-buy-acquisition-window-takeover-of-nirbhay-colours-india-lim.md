- Clause 7 of the LoF has been amended to clarify delay provisions: if regulatory approvals are delayed, litigation stays the offer, or SEBI instructs the acquirers to halt, payment of consideration and return of unaccepted shares may be delayed.

## Impact Assessment

This corrigendum has a **limited and targeted impact**, affecting only the shareholders and acquirers involved in the open offer for Nirbhay Colours India Limited, a small-cap Gujarat-based company. The revision of the tendering window by approximately two weeks (opening shifted to 16th February 2026 and closing to 2nd March 2026) provides shareholders additional time to evaluate and respond to the offer. The post-offer payment and advertisement deadlines remain unchanged (17th March and 25th March 2026 respectively), indicating the acquirers intend to complete settlement within the original final timeline. There is no broader market or systemic impact.
