This is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251229-6 dated December 29, 2025. The new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date of January 08, 2026.

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action notification involving ISIN modification due to share sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN number INE911Z01025 for all trades in A-1 LTD equity shares executed on or after January 08, 2026
- Update trading and settlement systems to reflect the new ISIN and revised face value of Re.1/- per share
- Ensure proper reconciliation of holdings under the old and new ISIN numbers

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 07, 2026
- **Ex-Date**: January 08, 2026 (new ISIN becomes effective)
- **Reference Notice Date**: December 29, 2025 (Notice No. 20251229-6)

## Impact Assessment

The ISIN change affects A-1 LTD shareholders and trading members. Share sub-division from Rs.10/- to Re.1/- increases liquidity by reducing per-share price, making the stock more accessible to retail investors. Trading members must ensure system readiness to handle the new ISIN from the ex-date. No impact on shareholding percentage or total investment value for existing shareholders, but share quantity will increase proportionately (10x). Demat accounts will be credited with subdivided shares automatically.
