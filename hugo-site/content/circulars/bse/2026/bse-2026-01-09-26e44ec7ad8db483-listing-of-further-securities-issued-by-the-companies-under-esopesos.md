## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The listing of ESOP shares is a routine corporate action with negligible impact on stock prices or trading volumes. The total number of shares (201,115) represents a small fraction of the outstanding shares for these companies.

**Liquidity Impact:** Marginal increase in free float for the affected companies. Axis Bank accounts for approximately 69% of the total shares being listed.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders may experience minor dilution, but the impact is negligible given the small quantum of shares relative to market capitalization.

**Operational Impact:** Market participants need to update their records and systems to reflect the increased share count for these securities.
