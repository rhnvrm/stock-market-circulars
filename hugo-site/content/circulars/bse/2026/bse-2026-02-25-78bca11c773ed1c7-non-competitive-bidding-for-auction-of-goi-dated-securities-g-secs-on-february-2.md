## Impact Assessment

This is a standard periodic government securities auction notice impacting debt market participants and trading members registered on BSE's iBBS platform. The re-issuance of 6.48% GS 2035 at Rs. 32,000 crore is a sizeable offering that could influence short-term liquidity and yield benchmarks in the debt segment. The tight bidding window (closing 8:00 AM on auction day for members) requires prompt action from participants. No equity market impact is expected.
