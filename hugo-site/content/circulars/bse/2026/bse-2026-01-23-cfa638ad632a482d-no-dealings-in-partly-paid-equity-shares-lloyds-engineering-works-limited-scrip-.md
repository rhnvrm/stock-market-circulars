---

## Summary

BSE has directed trading members to cease all dealings in the partly paid equity shares of Lloyds Engineering Works Limited (Scrip Code 890216) effective January 28, 2026. The suspension is necessitated by the company's record date for determining eligible shareholders for the First and Final Call payment.

## Key Points

- Trading in partly paid equity shares suspended from January 28, 2026 (Settlement DR-807/2025-2026)
- Record date set for January 28, 2026
- First and Final Call amount: Rs 16 per share (Rs 0.50 face value + Rs 15.50 share premium)
- Suspension applies only to partly paid equity shares (Scrip Code 890216)
- Call notice will be sent to holders of partly paid-up equity shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a routine corporate action suspension to facilitate call payment processing.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must immediately cease all dealings in partly paid equity shares of Lloyds Engineering Works Limited
- Members must take note of the suspension and ensure no transactions occur from January 28, 2026
- Company will issue First and Final Call notices to eligible shareholders as per record date

## Important Dates

- **January 23, 2026**: Circular issued
- **January 28, 2026**: Record date for determining eligible shareholders
- **January 28, 2026**: No dealings commence (Settlement DR-807/2025-2026)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Complete trading halt in the specific scrip affects liquidity and shareholders' ability to trade partly paid shares. Shareholders holding partly paid shares must prepare for the call payment of Rs 16 per share.

**Shareholder Impact**: Holders of partly paid shares are required to pay the remaining 50% call money (Rs 16 per share) comprising face value and share premium. Failure to respond to the call notice may result in forfeiture of shares.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block transactions in scrip code 890216 and inform clients holding these shares about the suspension and payment obligation.
