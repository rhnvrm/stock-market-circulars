## Impact Assessment

This listing represents a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment through share swap indicates a corporate restructuring or acquisition transaction. The lock-in period of approximately 7 months provides stability by preventing immediate selling pressure from allottees. The issue price of Rs. 557.94 reflects a significant premium over face value, suggesting the transaction valued TCC Concept Limited's shares at this level. Market participants should be aware of the additional float becoming available post lock-in expiry.
