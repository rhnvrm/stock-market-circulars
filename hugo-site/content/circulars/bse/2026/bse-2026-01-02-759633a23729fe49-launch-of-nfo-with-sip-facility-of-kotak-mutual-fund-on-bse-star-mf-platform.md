## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine NFO launch that expands investment options on the BSE StAR MF Platform but does not affect market operations or trading.

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium for BSE StAR MF members - Members need to ensure compliance with fund collection timelines and communicate deadlines to clients for NFO participation. The strict fund availability requirements (January 23, 2026 by 6:00 PM) and different cut-off times for lumpsum vs SIP registrations require operational attention.

**Investor Impact**: Low - Provides new investment opportunity in dividend yield equity strategy through Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund with both regular and direct plan options across growth and income distribution variants.
