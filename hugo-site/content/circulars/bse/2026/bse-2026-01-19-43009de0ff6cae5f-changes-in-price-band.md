Price bands determine the maximum percentage change allowed in a stock's price during a trading session. Tighter bands (2%) restrict price volatility, while wider bands (10%) allow greater price movement. This revision indicates BSE's assessment of appropriate volatility limits for these securities based on surveillance criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the revised price bands
- Orders exceeding the new price bands will be rejected
- Members should ensure proper communication to clients regarding the revised trading parameters

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

The revision affects trading dynamics for the listed securities. Securities with tighter bands (2%) like Ashnisha Industries and Chandni Machines will experience restricted intraday volatility, while those with 10% bands like Bosch Home Comfort India, JTL Industries, Mukat Pipes, and ZR2 Bioenergy will have wider trading ranges. This may impact liquidity, trading strategies, and risk management for market participants dealing in these stocks.
