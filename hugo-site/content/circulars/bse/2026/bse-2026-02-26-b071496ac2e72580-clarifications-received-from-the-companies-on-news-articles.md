title: Clarifications from Reliance Infrastructure and Jindal Poly Films on News Articles
---

## Summary

BSE has published clarifications from two listed companies — Reliance Infrastructure Limited and Jindal Poly Films Limited — in response to rumour verification letters issued by BSE/NSE dated February 26, 2026, relating to news articles appearing in media publications.

## Key Points

- **Reliance Infrastructure Ltd (BSE: 500390 | NSE: RELINFRA):** The company clarified that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) Provisional Attachment Order referenced in media reports and the ED Press Release dated February 25, 2026 pertains to **Reliance Communications Limited**, not Reliance Infrastructure. The company stated no disclosure is warranted under applicable regulations and declined to comment on stock price movements.
- **Jindal Poly Films Limited:** The company confirmed that the Hon'ble National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), New Delhi, dismissed its appeal (Company Appeal (AT) No. 47 of 2026) on February 26, 2026, which was filed against an NCLT order dated February 5, 2026.
- Jindal Poly Films confirmed it has **not entered into any negotiations** with the counterparty as of the date of the letter.
- Jindal Poly Films stated it is unaware of any information explaining the movement in trading price/volume and committed to promptly notify exchanges of any material developments.
- The original NCLT admission had been disclosed to exchanges on February 6, 2026, in compliance with SEBI Listing Regulations.

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced. These are disclosure compliance responses under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- Both companies have responded to BSE/NSE rumour verification queries as required under SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015.
- Jindal Poly Films has undertaken to promptly notify exchanges of any future material events related to the NCLAT/NCLT proceedings.

## Important Dates

- **February 5, 2026:** NCLT Principal Bench, New Delhi passed order in the Jindal Poly Films matter.
- **February 6, 2026:** Jindal Poly Films disclosed NCLT proceedings to stock exchanges.
- **February 25, 2026:** ED Press Release issued regarding Provisional Attachment Order (pertaining to Reliance Communications).
- **February 26, 2026:** BSE/NSE rumour verification letters issued to both companies; NCLAT dismissed Jindal Poly Films appeal (Company Appeal (AT) No. 47 of 2026); both clarification letters submitted.

## Impact Assessment

- **Reliance Infrastructure:** The clarification is intended to reassure investors that the ED enforcement action under PMLA is directed at Reliance Communications and has no direct bearing on Reliance Infrastructure. This may reduce near-term negative price pressure arising from the news.
- **Jindal Poly Films:** The NCLAT dismissal of the company's appeal is an adverse legal development. The company's statement that no negotiations with the counterparty are ongoing, combined with the commitment to future disclosures, signals ongoing legal risk. Investors should monitor further developments in the NCLT/NCLAT proceedings.
- Both clarifications are company-specific and do not have broader sectoral or systemic market implications.
