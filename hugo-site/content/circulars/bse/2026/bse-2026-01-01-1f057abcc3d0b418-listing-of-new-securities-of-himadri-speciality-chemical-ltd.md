## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date:** November 7, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact. This is a routine listing of preferential allotment shares representing warrant conversion. The lock-in provisions on 1,00,00,000 shares until July 16, 2027 will restrict immediate selling pressure. The relatively small number of shares without extended lock-in (17,200 shares) will have minimal impact on liquidity. Standard procedural notification for trading members with no operational changes required.
