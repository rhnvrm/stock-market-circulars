## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The inclusion of securities in ST-ASM framework significantly affects their liquidity and trading dynamics. Enhanced surveillance measures typically result in reduced trading activity and higher transaction costs.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will face stricter trading conditions including potentially tighter price bands and higher margin requirements. Securities exiting the framework may see improved liquidity.

**SME Impact**: Multiple SME securities are included in this circular, indicating heightened regulatory scrutiny of smaller companies. This may impact investor confidence in the SME segment.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and risk management frameworks to account for the changed surveillance status of these securities.
