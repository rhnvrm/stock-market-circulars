## Impact Assessment

The listing of approximately 18.19 crore new equity shares represents a substantial increase in the share capital of Viyash Scientific Ltd following the amalgamation of nine entities. This merger consolidates operations across multiple pharmaceutical and life sciences companies. The dilution impact will depend on the pre-existing share capital, but the large number of new shares may affect liquidity and trading patterns. Shareholders of the transferor companies now hold equity in the amalgamated entity. The name change from Sequent Scientific to Viyash Scientific reflects the post-merger identity. Market participants should adjust their records and systems to account for the increased float and monitor trading volumes on the commencement date.
