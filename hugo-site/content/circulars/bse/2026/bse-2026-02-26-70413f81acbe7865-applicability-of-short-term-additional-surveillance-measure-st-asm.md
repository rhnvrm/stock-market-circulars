title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) w.e.f.
  February 27, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular specifying changes to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective February 27, 2026. Six securities have been newly shortlisted under the ST-ASM 5/15/30 Days framework (Stage I), no securities are moving to higher or lower stages within the framework, and ten securities are exiting the ST-ASM framework entirely.

## Key Points

- **6 securities newly added** to Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework (Stage I) w.e.f. February 27, 2026
- **NIL** securities moving to a higher ASM stage within the ST-ASM framework
- **NIL** securities moving to a lower ASM stage within the ST-ASM framework
- **10 securities removed** from the ST-ASM framework w.e.f. February 27, 2026
- Securities marked with `*` are listed as per NSE; securities marked `@` are SME scrips
- A consolidated list (Annexure III) details all securities currently under the ST-ASM framework with their respective stages

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance to securities exhibiting abnormal price or volume movements. Securities placed under ASM are subject to additional margin requirements and trading restrictions. This circular implements the following changes:

| 9 | 531822 | INE513E01024 | Rodium Realty Ltd |
| 10 | 530617 | INE375C01022 | Sampre Nutritions Ltd |

## Compliance Requirements

- **Brokers and trading members** must apply enhanced margin requirements for securities newly placed under ST-ASM Stage I effective February 27, 2026
- **Investors** holding or trading in newly added securities should be aware of applicable trading restrictions and margin obligations
- Securities removed from ST-ASM revert to normal trading conditions unless moved to an alternate framework (LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge, or ESM)
- SME scrips marked `@` are subject to the same ST-ASM restrictions as mainboard securities

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 27, 2026 — all additions, removals, and stage movements take effect from this date

## Impact Assessment

Securities newly added to ST-ASM Stage I will face increased margin requirements, which typically reduces trading volumes and liquidity in those scrips. Retail and institutional participants holding these securities may see position-level impacts due to higher margin calls. The six newly added securities span diverse sectors including education (CL Educate), polyester films (Jindal Poly Films), technology (Panabyte, Yatra Online), agriculture (Shiva Global Agro), and real estate (Sikozy Realtors). The ten securities exiting the ST-ASM framework will see trading conditions normalize, potentially improving liquidity. Securities exiting due to inclusion in LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge, or ESM frameworks remain under enhanced oversight under those respective regimes.
