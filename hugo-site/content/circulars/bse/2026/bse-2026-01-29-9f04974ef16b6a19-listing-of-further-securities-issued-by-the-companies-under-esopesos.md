## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine corporate action that typically has minimal market impact. The shares being listed represent a small percentage of the total outstanding equity for most companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal - The additional shares will marginally increase the free float and tradable quantity in the market.

**Dilution Impact**: Negligible - For large-cap companies like Infosys (6,914 shares) and Kotak Mahindra Bank (830,630 shares), the dilution is minimal given their large equity bases.

**Lock-in Consideration**: Only Network People Services Technologies Limited has shares under lock-in until May 11, 2026, meaning these 8,900 shares cannot be traded until the lock-in period expires.

**Investor Consideration**: These shares are issued as part of employee compensation schemes and represent employee exercising their stock options, which is generally viewed as a positive sign of employee confidence in the company.
