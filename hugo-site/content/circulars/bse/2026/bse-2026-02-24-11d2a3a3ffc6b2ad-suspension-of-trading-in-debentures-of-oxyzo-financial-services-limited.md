## Summary

BSE has issued a notice directing trading members to suspend dealings in the Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of OXYZO FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED. The suspension is in connection with the upcoming redemption of the debenture series OFSL-9.25%-16-3-26-PVT (ISIN: INE04VS07347, Code: 976015), with a record date of 1 March 2026.

## Key Points

- Trading in debentures of OXYZO FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED is suspended effective 27 February 2026.
- The affected instrument is OFSL-9.25%-16-3-26-PVT with ISIN INE04VS07347 (Scrip Code: 976015).
- The record date for redemption is 1 March 2026.
- The notice reference is DR-830/2025-2026.
- Issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance And Operations.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This is a routine operational notice under existing BSE debt segment rules requiring suspension of trading prior to a redemption record date.

## Compliance Requirements

- All trading members on BSE must refrain from transacting in the specified debenture series (INE04VS07347 / Code 976015) from 27 February 2026 onwards.
- Members must update their systems and inform clients accordingly.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** 24 February 2026
- **No Dealings From:** 27 February 2026
- **Record Date (Redemption):** 1 March 2026

## Impact Assessment

Debt market participants and investors holding OFSL-9.25%-16-3-26-PVT NCDs will be unable to trade or exit positions from 27 February 2026. This is a standard pre-redemption suspension and indicates the instrument will be fully redeemed on or around the record date. Impact is limited to holders of this specific NCD series; broader market impact is low given the instrument is privately placed.
