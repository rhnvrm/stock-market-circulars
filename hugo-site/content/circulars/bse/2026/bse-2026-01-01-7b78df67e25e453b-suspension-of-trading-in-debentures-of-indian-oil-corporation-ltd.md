## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of this specific IOCL debenture series. The suspension is a routine procedural requirement for debenture redemption and does not reflect any adverse development.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will receive their redemption proceeds and final interest payment as per the terms. Secondary market liquidity is eliminated from the suspension date, but this is expected given the proximity to maturity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to prevent inadvertent trading in the suspended instrument. Standard corporate action processing applies.
