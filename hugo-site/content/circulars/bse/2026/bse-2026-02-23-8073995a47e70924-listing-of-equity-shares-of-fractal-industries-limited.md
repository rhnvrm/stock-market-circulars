## Impact Assessment

The listing of Fractal Industries Limited introduces a new equity scrip to BSE. However, the effective free float is constrained: 79.31% of total shares are under lock-in, leaving only approximately 20.69% freely tradeable in the near term. The public holding of 30.93% includes 803,917 locked-in shares, further reducing liquidity. Investors should note the high promoter concentration (69.07%) and the significant lock-in position when assessing trading liquidity and price discovery for this scrip.
