## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** SLB participants need to monitor their positions and ensure timely settlement before foreclosure dates. This is a routine operational requirement for corporate actions but requires active position management.

**Investor Impact:** Investors participating in SLB for these securities must be aware of foreclosure timelines to maintain dividend eligibility and avoid disruption to their lending/borrowing strategies.
