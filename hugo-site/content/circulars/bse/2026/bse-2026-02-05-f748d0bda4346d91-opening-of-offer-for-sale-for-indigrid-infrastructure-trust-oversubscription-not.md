  Option Exercised
---

## Summary

The Government of Singapore, through GIC Pte. Ltd., has exercised the oversubscription option to sell an additional 2,64,59,185 units of IndiGrid Infrastructure Trust (InvIT). This is in addition to the base offer of 4,36,31,371 units, bringing the total offer size to 7,00,90,556 units, representing 7.36% of the InvIT's unit capital. The offer is being conducted through the stock exchange mechanism on BSE and NSE.

## Key Points

- Base Offer Units: 4,36,31,371 units (4.58% of unit capital)
- Oversubscription Option exercised: 2,64,59,185 units (2.78% of unit capital)
- Total Offer Size: 7,00,90,556 units (7.36% of unit capital)
- Seller: Government of Singapore (public unitholder)
- Asset Manager: GIC Pte. Ltd.
- Retail Reservation: 70,09,057 units allocated for retail investors
- Offer conducted through separate designated window of Stock Exchanges

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a market transaction under existing stock exchange mechanisms for offer for sale by unitholders.

## Compliance Requirements

- The oversubscription option exercise intimation sent to both BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of India Limited
- Retail investor allocation: 10% of total offer size (70,09,057 units) reserved for retail investors
- Transaction to be conducted through separate designated stock exchange window as per established procedures

## Important Dates

- **February 04, 2026**: Notice of offer for sale issued by the Seller
- **February 05, 2026 (T Day)**: Offer open for non-retail investors only; Oversubscription option exercised
- **February 06, 2026 (T+1 Day)**: Offer open for retail investors and non-retail investors with un-allotted bids carried forward

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The sale of 7.36% unit capital by a major institutional investor (Government of Singapore) may create temporary supply pressure on IndiGrid units. However, the structured offer through stock exchange mechanism with retail reservation provides orderly price discovery.

**Liquidity Impact**: The offer increases floating units in the market and provides exit opportunity for existing seller while offering entry/accumulation opportunity for retail and institutional investors.

**Investor Impact**: Retail investors get dedicated allocation of approximately 70 lakh units on T+1 day. Non-retail investors can participate on both T day and T+1 day (for un-allotted bids).
