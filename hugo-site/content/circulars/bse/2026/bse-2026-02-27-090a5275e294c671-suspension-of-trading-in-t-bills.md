## Summary

## Key Points

- Three T-Bills across different tenors (91-day, 182-day, and 364-day) are maturing and being suspended from trading
- Suspension is effective from **March 2, 2026**
- All three instruments will cease trading simultaneously on the effective date
- Reference: DR-831/2025-2026
- Notice issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance & Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine operational notice under existing BSE debt market procedures for maturing government securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must **not deal** in the following T-Bills from March 2, 2026 onwards:

| Sr. No. | Scrip Code | ISIN | Particulars |
|---------|------------|------|-------------|
| 1 | 805036 | IN002024Z479 | 364TB05326 |
| 2 | 805113 | IN002025Y230 | 182TB50326 |
| 3 | 805151 | IN002025X364 | 91TB050326 |

- Members must update their systems to reflect the trading suspension for these scrip codes

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 27, 2026
- **Suspension Effective Date:** March 2, 2026 (Redemption Date)

## Impact Assessment

Impact is minimal and routine. The suspension of these three T-Bills is a standard end-of-lifecycle action as the instruments reach maturity. Holders will receive redemption proceeds as per normal government securities settlement procedures. No broader market impact is anticipated. Trading members should ensure their trading systems and risk management frameworks exclude these scrip codes from March 2, 2026.
