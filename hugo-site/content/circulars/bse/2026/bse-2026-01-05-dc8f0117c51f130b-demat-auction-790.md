## Summary

BSE has issued a demat auction notice for Settlement No. 790 dated January 5, 2026. The circular lists securities and their respective quantities that are subject to demat auction due to delivery failures. The auction includes approximately 116 different scrips across various sectors with quantities ranging from 1 share to over 600,000 shares.

## Key Points

- Settlement Number: 790
- Date: January 5, 2026
- Total scrips listed: Approximately 116 securities
- Highest quantity: WELCURE DRUG (613,972 shares)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a routine operational notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members who have failed to deliver securities in Settlement 790 must participate in the demat auction
- Affected members must ensure compliance with BSE auction settlement procedures
- Members must fulfill their delivery obligations through the auction mechanism

## Important Dates

- Settlement Date: January 5, 2026
- Settlement Number: 790
- Auction date and timings would be communicated as per BSE's standard auction schedule

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative action with limited market-wide impact. The demat auction mechanism is a standard settlement process used when members fail to deliver securities. While individual scrips may experience temporary price movements during the auction, the overall market impact is minimal. The large quantity of WELCURE DRUG shares (613,972) and EVEXIA LIFEC shares (34,729) in the auction may warrant attention from stakeholders of those specific companies. For most listed scrips, the quantities are small relative to their typical trading volumes.
