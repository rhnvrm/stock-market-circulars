- **January 15, 2026**: Record Date for sub-division; Trading/Settlement Holiday

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects trading and settlement operations for Ajmera Realty shares. The revision of the ex-date from the originally scheduled date to January 14, 2026 requires trading members to update their systems and processes accordingly.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems are updated to:
- Recognize the new ISIN from January 14, 2026
- Block transactions using the old ISIN from the ex-date
- Handle the 1:5 split ratio correctly in their order management and settlement systems

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares of Rs.2 face value for every 1 share of Rs.10 face value held as of the record date. The total value remains unchanged, but liquidity may improve due to lower price per share post-split.

**Timeline Sensitivity**: The one-day advance of the ex-date due to the January 15 trading holiday requires prompt action from all market participants to avoid settlement issues.
