## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine demat auction affecting only specific trading members with outstanding delivery obligations.

**Operational Impact:** Limited to brokers and clients involved in failed deliveries. The quantities involved are relatively small for most scrips, indicating normal settlement issues rather than systemic problems.

**Investor Impact:** Direct impact only on investors/brokers with pending delivery obligations for the listed scrips. May result in auction settlement at potentially different prices than original transaction prices.
