## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers and trading members must update trading systems to apply the revised LT-ASM classifications from March 02, 2026
- Clients holding newly added securities should be informed of enhanced margin and trade-for-trade settlement requirements
- Clearing members must ensure adequate margin collection for newly added LT-ASM securities
- Securities exiting LT-ASM revert to normal trading conditions; members should update margin and settlement parameters accordingly

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 27, 2026
- **Effective Date for all changes:** March 02, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact:** The addition of 7 securities to LT-ASM imposes immediate trading restrictions including trade-for-trade settlement and higher margin requirements, reducing liquidity and increasing the cost of trading for investors in these counters. Retail and institutional investors holding these securities may face forced liquidation pressures due to margin increases.

**Positive Development:** 25 securities exiting LT-ASM signals regulatory confidence in their improved trading behaviour, restoring normal liquidity conditions. Similarly, 6 securities being moved to lower ASM stages represents partial normalisation.

**Market Segment Affected:** Primarily small-cap and micro-cap equity segment on BSE. The framework is designed to protect investors from price manipulation and abnormal price movements in low-liquidity stocks.

**Investor Action Required:** Investors in newly added securities should review margin requirements with their brokers before March 02, 2026. Investors in exiting securities can expect improved liquidity and normal settlement from the effective date.
