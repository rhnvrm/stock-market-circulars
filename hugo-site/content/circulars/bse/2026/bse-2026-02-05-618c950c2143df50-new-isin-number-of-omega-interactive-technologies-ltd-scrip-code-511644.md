**Trading Impact**: Moderate impact on trading members dealing with this scrip. All trades from February 6, 2026 must use the new ISIN for proper settlement.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares of Re.1/- face value for every 1 share of Rs.10/- face value held. The total investment value remains unchanged, but liquidity may improve due to lower per-share price post-split.

**Operational Impact**: Trading and back-office systems need to be updated to reflect the new ISIN and adjusted share quantities. Depository participants must ensure proper credit of sub-divided shares to client accounts.
