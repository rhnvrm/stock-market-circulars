title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Securities Moving to New GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of 8 securities into their respective Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages. The circular lists companies moving to GSM Stage I (2 securities), Stage II (2 securities), Stage III (1 security), and Stage IV (3 securities). Higher GSM stages typically impose stricter trading restrictions and surveillance measures.

## Key Points

- 2 securities moving to GSM Stage I: Adline Chem Lab Limited and Alan Scott Enterprises Limited
- 2 securities moving to GSM Stage II: Sungold Capital Ltd. and Minolta Finance Ltd.
- 1 security moving to GSM Stage III: Caprolactam Chemicals Ltd.
- 3 securities moving to GSM Stage IV: Softbpo Global Services Ltd., Charms Industries Ltd., and Hari Govind International Ltd.
- Securities may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM Framework (marked #) or IBC Framework (marked $)
- Some classifications aligned with NSE standards (marked *)

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework involves progressive surveillance stages with increasing restrictions:
- Stage I: Initial surveillance with enhanced monitoring
- Stage II: Additional disclosure requirements and trading restrictions
- Stage III: Further tightened surveillance measures
- Stage IV: Most stringent surveillance with maximum trading restrictions

Movement to higher stages indicates concerns about price volatility, corporate governance, or compliance issues.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors trading in these securities must be aware of applicable GSM restrictions at each stage
- Trading members must ensure compliance with GSM-specific margin requirements and position limits
- Additional surveillance margin and trade-to-trade settlement may apply depending on GSM stage
- Enhanced disclosure and due diligence requirements for transactions in GSM securities

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: January 27, 2026
- Effective Date: As per BSE surveillance framework (typically immediate or next trading session)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - Securities moving to higher GSM stages face reduced liquidity, higher transaction costs, and limited investor participation. Stage IV represents the highest level of surveillance with maximum restrictions.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding these securities may experience difficulties in exiting positions due to trade-to-trade settlement requirements and reduced market participation. Additional margins may be required.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and trading members must update their risk management systems to reflect the new GSM classifications and ensure appropriate margin collection and position monitoring.
