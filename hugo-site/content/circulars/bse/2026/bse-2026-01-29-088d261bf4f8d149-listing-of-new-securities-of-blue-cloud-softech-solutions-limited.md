## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this is a routine listing notification for a single company. The preferential allotment increases the issued share capital significantly. Lock-in provisions will restrict immediate tradability of these shares, with approximately 55.5% of new shares locked until 2028 and 44.5% locked until 2026. Market participants should note the increased float post lock-in expiry dates.
