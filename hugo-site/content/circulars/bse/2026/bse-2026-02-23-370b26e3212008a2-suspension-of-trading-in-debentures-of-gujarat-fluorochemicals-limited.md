## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited has fixed a Record Date of March 4, 2026 for the redemption and interest payment on its 8.52% Non-Convertible Debentures (ISIN: INE09N307018, Scrip Code: 974687). Trading in these debentures is suspended with effect from March 4, 2026 (i.e., no dealings are permitted from that date onwards).

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies to: **GFL-8.52%-20-3-26-PVT** (ISIN: INE09N307018, Scrip Code: 974687)
- Record Date fixed: **March 4, 2026**
- Purpose: Redemption of Debentures and Payment of Interest
- No dealings permitted from: **March 4, 2026**
- Circular reference: DR-832/2025-2026
- Issued by: Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational notice in accordance with BSE's procedures for NCD redemptions, requiring trading members to halt transactions in the specified security ahead of the record date.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must **not deal in** the debenture GFL-8.52%-20-3-26-PVT (ISIN: INE09N307018 / Scrip Code: 974687) from March 4, 2026 onwards.
- Members should update their systems and alert desks to block or flag trades in this ISIN effective the no-dealings date.

## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Circular Issue Date | February 23, 2026 |
| Record Date | March 4, 2026 |
| No Dealings From | March 4, 2026 |
| Debenture Maturity (implied by name) | March 20, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited and routine in nature. Only holders or prospective traders of Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited's 8.52% NCD maturing on March 20, 2026 are affected. The suspension prevents any last-minute secondary market transactions in this instrument after the record date, ensuring clean settlement for redemption proceeds and accrued interest. No broader market or equity-segment impact is expected.
