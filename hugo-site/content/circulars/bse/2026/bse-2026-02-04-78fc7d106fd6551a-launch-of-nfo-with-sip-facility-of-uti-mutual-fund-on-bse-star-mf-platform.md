## Impact Assessment

This NFO launch has minimal market impact as it represents a standard new mutual fund scheme offering. The impact is limited to:

- **Investors**: New investment option for those seeking Shariah-compliant equity exposure to NIFTY500 constituents
- **BSE Members**: Operational implementation of NFO trading procedures and payment timelines on StAR MF Platform
- **Market Segment**: Expands Shariah-compliant investment product offerings in the mutual fund segment

The scheme targets a specific investor demographic interested in Islamic finance-compliant investment options while tracking the broader NIFTY500 Shariah Index performance.
