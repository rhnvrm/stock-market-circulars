## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing of 1,20,000 shares represents a small addition to the company's equity capital. The preferential allotment to non-promoters may provide some liquidity post lock-in period.

**Operational Impact**: Routine administrative update for trading members. The lock-in period until July 31, 2026 means these shares cannot be traded for approximately 7 months from the listing date, limiting immediate market supply.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may experience minor dilution. New shares rank equally with existing shares (pari-passu), ensuring no differential rights.
