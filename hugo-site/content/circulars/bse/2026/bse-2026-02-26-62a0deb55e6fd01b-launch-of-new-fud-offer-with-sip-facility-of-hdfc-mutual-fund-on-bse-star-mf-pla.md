## Impact Assessment

This circular has low market impact as it is a routine NFO launch notification. It is operationally relevant to BSE members dealing in mutual funds on the BSE StAR MF platform. Members need to ensure their systems are configured to handle the NFO transactions, enforce the fund initiation deadlines, and communicate SIP/XSIP authentication timelines to their clients. No broader market or regulatory impact is anticipated.
