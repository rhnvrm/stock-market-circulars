The shares are issued at Rs. 10/- face value with a premium of Rs. 6/- (total issue price Rs. 16/-) and will rank pari-passu with existing equity shares. Trading commences from Friday, February 6, 2026.

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The listing represents approximately 10-15% dilution depending on existing share capital, but shares are issued to non-promoters with a lock-in period until August 31, 2026, limiting immediate trading supply. The issue price of Rs. 16/- provides a reference point for valuation.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Standard listing procedure with clear distribution numbers and lock-in details provided. Trading members can facilitate transactions from February 6, 2026.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders face dilution from the preferential allotment, but the lock-in period provides stability. Non-promoter allottees cannot sell until lock-in expiry, reducing short-term selling pressure.
