**Securities Available for Bidding:**

| Security | Symbol | Type | Issue Size (Cr) | Min Lot | Min Amt (Rs.) | Max Amt (Cr) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 91 Day T-Bill | 091T270526 | T-Bills (New) | 14,000 | 100 | 10,000 | 700 |
| 182 Day T-Bill | 182T260826 | T-Bills (New) | 12,000 | 100 | 10,000 | 600 |

This is a routine debt market operation with moderate market impact. The total issuance of Rs. 34,000 Crore in T-Bills will affect short-term liquidity and interest rate benchmarks. Trading members and institutional investors in the debt segment need to act promptly given the short bidding window, particularly members whose deadline is 8:00 AM on auction day.
