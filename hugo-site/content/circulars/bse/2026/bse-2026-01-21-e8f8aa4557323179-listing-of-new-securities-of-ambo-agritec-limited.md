- **Lock-in Expiry:** August 31, 2027

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. The preferential allotment to promoters increases the paid-up capital but has minimal immediate trading impact due to the lock-in period extending until August 2027. The shares cannot be traded by promoters for approximately 19 months from listing date.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal for market participants. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and distinctive number ranges. The pari-passu ranking ensures uniform treatment with existing shares for corporate actions.

**Investor Considerations:** The warrant conversion demonstrates promoter commitment through capital infusion. The lengthy lock-in period provides stability by preventing immediate dilution through promoter sales.
