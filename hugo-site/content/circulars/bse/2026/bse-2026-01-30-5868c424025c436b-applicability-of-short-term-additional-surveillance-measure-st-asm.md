## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues BSE's surveillance mechanism for securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or excessive volatility. Securities under this framework are subject to:

- Enhanced surveillance monitoring
- Potential trading restrictions at various ASM stages
- Additional margin requirements
- Price band limitations

The framework operates on 5/15/30 day monitoring periods with progressive stages (Stage I, Stage II, etc.) based on continued surveillance triggers.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure awareness of securities under ST-ASM framework
- Enhanced due diligence required for client orders in ST-ASM securities
- Margin requirements as specified by the exchange must be collected
- Surveillance parameters and trading restrictions must be adhered to
- Risk management systems should be updated to reflect ST-ASM securities list

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 01, 2026 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable
- **Circular Date**: January 30, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 10 securities to ST-ASM framework will result in enhanced surveillance and potentially stricter trading parameters for these stocks. Investors in these securities may experience reduced liquidity and higher margin requirements.

**Trading Impact**: Securities entering ST-ASM framework typically face increased scrutiny, higher margins, and potential price volatility restrictions. This may dampen speculative activity and reduce trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: Existing investors in the 10 newly added securities should be aware of potential liquidity constraints and increased compliance requirements. The 9 securities exiting the framework will have relaxed surveillance measures, potentially improving liquidity.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members must update their risk management systems, surveillance tools, and client communication regarding the revised ST-ASM list to ensure compliance with exchange requirements.
