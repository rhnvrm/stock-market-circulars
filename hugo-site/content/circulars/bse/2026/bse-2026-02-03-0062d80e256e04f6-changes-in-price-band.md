## Regulatory Changes

This circular represents a surveillance action by BSE to revise price bands from their existing levels. Price bands are regulatory tools that limit the maximum price movement (up or down) for a security during a trading session. Tighter bands indicate heightened surveillance and are typically applied to stocks exhibiting unusual volatility or requiring closer monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands in their systems before market opening on February 4, 2026
- All orders and trades must comply with new price band restrictions
- Trading members should communicate changes to clients trading in affected securities
- Clarifications may be requested at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: February 3, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 4, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements for affected securities, reducing trading flexibility and potentially impacting liquidity.

**Trading Impact**: Securities with 2% bands face significant constraints on daily price movement, which may deter speculative trading but also reduce liquidity. The tight bands suggest these stocks are under enhanced surveillance.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will experience limited price discovery and reduced ability to enter/exit positions at desired prices during volatile market conditions.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update risk management systems and alert algorithms to accommodate new price limits before market opening on February 4, 2026.
