## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium. The auction calendar provides visibility into government borrowing plans through short-term instruments for the quarter, enabling debt market participants to plan liquidity and investment strategies. The higher auction amounts in February-March (₹34,000-35,000 crore vs ₹29,000 crore in January) indicate increased short-term funding requirements toward quarter-end.

**Liquidity Impact:** The staggered weekly auctions ensure regular liquidity absorption from the banking system. The total issuance of ₹3,84,000 crore represents routine government cash management operations.

**Investor Impact:** Relevant for money market participants, banks, primary dealers, mutual funds, and institutional investors who participate in T-Bill auctions. Provides advance planning opportunity for short-term investment allocations.

**Flexibility Caveat:** RBI's stated flexibility to modify amounts and timing means participants should monitor for updates, particularly around evolving market conditions or government financing needs.
