**Market Participants:**
Traders and investors in these securities should be aware of stricter trading conditions. SME securities constitute a significant portion of the affected list, indicating heightened scrutiny in the SME segment.

**Investor Protection:**
The measure aims to curb excessive speculation and protect retail investors from abnormal price movements in these securities.
