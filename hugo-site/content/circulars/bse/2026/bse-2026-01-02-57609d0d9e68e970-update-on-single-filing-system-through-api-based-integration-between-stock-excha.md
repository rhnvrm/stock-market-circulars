title: Update on Single Filing System Through API-Based Integration Between Stock
  Exchanges
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the extension of its single filing system through API-based integration between stock exchanges. The system now includes Integrated Filing (Financials) under Regulation 33 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015, effective January 3, 2026. This initiative enables listed entities to file disclosures once, which will be automatically shared across exchanges, eliminating the need for multiple filings.

## Key Points

- Single filing system extended to include Integrated Filing (Financials) from January 3, 2026
- System covers equity and equity+debt listed companies initially; exclusively debt, REITs and INVITs dates to be communicated later
- Listed entities must avoid multiple filings of same disclosure on both exchanges
- Entities must respond to the exchange that seeks clarification post-submission
- References previous notice 20240930-60 dated September 30, 2024

1. **Integrated Filing (Financials)** - Regulations 33(3), 23(9), 32(1) & Reg 30 r/w Section V-B: January 3, 2026
