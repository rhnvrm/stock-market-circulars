## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Shareholders**: This open offer represents a significant corporate action that provides an exit opportunity for existing shareholders of Sanmitra Commercial Limited. The acquisition by the Jalan family members (acquirers and PACs) indicates a potential change in control or consolidation of shareholding. Shareholders must carefully evaluate the offer price and terms before deciding whether to tender their shares. The mandatory open offer under SEBI Takeover Regulations protects minority shareholder interests by providing them an opportunity to exit at a fair price during change of control scenarios.
