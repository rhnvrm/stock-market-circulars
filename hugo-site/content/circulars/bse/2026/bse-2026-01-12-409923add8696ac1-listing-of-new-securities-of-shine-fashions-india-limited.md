## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment**: October 29, 2025

- **Lock-in Period Expiry**: July 12, 2027 (all 65,000 shares locked-in until this date)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. This is a small preferential allotment representing warrant conversion by promoters.

The preferential issue to promoters typically indicates promoter commitment and may be viewed neutrally to positively by the market.
