Trading in all three instruments is suspended with effect from March 02, 2026 (DR-831/2025-2026). Members are advised to cease dealing in these T-Bills immediately.

## Key Points

- Three T-Bills are suspended from trading effective March 02, 2026
- Suspension is due to maturity/redemption of the instruments

- Scrip Code 805113 (ISIN: IN002025Y230) — 182-day T-Bill maturing March 5, 2026 (182TB50326)
- Scrip Code 805151 (ISIN: IN002025X364) — 91-day T-Bill maturing March 5, 2026 (91TB050326)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational notice under existing BSE rules governing debt segment instruments upon maturity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must immediately cease all transactions in scrip codes 805036, 805113, and 805151 effective March 02, 2026
- Members holding positions in these T-Bills should prepare for redemption proceeds settlement
- No fresh orders or trades to be placed in these instruments on or after the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 27, 2026
- **Suspension Effective From:** March 02, 2026
- **Redemption Date:** March 05, 2026 (implied by T-Bill naming convention for all three instruments)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine, low-disruption event. The suspension affects only participants holding or intending to trade in these three specific T-Bill instruments on the BSE debt segment. Redemption proceeds will be received by holders on the maturity date. There is no systemic market impact. Trading members should update their systems to block new orders for these scrip codes before the market opens on March 02, 2026.
