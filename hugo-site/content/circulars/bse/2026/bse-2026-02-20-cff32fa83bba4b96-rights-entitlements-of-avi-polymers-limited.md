## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational notice with limited market-wide impact. It affects shareholders of AVI POLYMERS LIMITED who received Rights Entitlements and investors who may wish to purchase REs on the secondary market. Investors must act before March 12, 2026 to renounce REs or before March 17, 2026 to subscribe to the Rights Issue; failure to do either will result in the REs lapsing with no value recovered.
