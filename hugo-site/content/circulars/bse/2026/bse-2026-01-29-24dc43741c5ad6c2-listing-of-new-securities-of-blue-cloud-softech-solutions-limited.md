## Summary

BSE has listed 316.8 million new equity shares of Blue Cloud Softech Solutions Limited (Scrip Code: 539607) issued on a preferential basis to promoters and non-promoters. The shares are permitted to trade from January 30, 2026, with differential lock-in periods based on investor category.

## Key Points

- 31.68 crore (316.8 million) equity shares of Rs. 1/- each issued at a premium of Rs. 22.06/-
- Issue price: Rs. 23.06 per share
- Allotment date: December 10, 2025
- Trading commencement: January 30, 2026
- Distinctive numbers: 436281601 to 753081600
- ISIN: INE373T01047
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notice following preferential allotment procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note the lock-in restrictions:
- 141.075 million shares (Dist. Nos. 436281601-577356600): Locked until August 14, 2028
- 175.725 million shares (Dist. Nos. 577356601-753081600): Locked until August 14, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: December 10, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: January 30, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry (Partial)**: August 14, 2026 (175.725 million shares)
- **Lock-in Expiry (Balance)**: August 14, 2028 (141.075 million shares)

## Impact Assessment

This preferential issue represents substantial equity dilution for existing shareholders. The staggered lock-in periods indicate 44.5% of issued shares (promoter quota) are locked for nearly 2.5 years, while 55.5% (non-promoter quota) have a shorter 7-month lock-in from trading date. The significant number of shares and extended lock-in suggests this is a major capital raising exercise, though immediate trading impact may be limited due to lock-in restrictions.
