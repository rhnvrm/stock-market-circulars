- **Listing Effective Date**: January 30, 2026 (Friday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: May 11, 2026 (for Network People Services Technologies Limited only)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing represents a small percentage increase in the outstanding shares of these companies and is part of routine ESOP/ESOS exercises.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible impact on overall liquidity as the share quantities are relatively small compared to total outstanding shares, except potentially for smaller companies.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may see minor dilution from these ESOP allotments, but this is standard practice for employee incentive programs.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems need to update share counts and ISIN distribution numbers for the listed companies. Only Network People Services Technologies requires special handling due to lock-in restrictions through May 2026.
