## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Ensure sufficient funds are available in settlement account (valan account) or Exchange dues account by February 04, 2026
- Review turnover details and fee amounts in EXTRANET (current date > EQ > Transaction) by February 03, 2026

- **February 04, 2026**: SEBI turnover fees including 18% GST debited from settlement/Exchange dues accounts

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to ensure adequate liquidity in their settlement accounts to accommodate the monthly SEBI turnover fee payment plus 18% GST. Failure to maintain sufficient funds could result in payment defaults and potential regulatory consequences.

**Financial Impact:** The 18% GST increases the effective cost of SEBI turnover fees by 18% compared to the base fee. This applies across all trading segments including Cash, Derivatives, Currency Derivatives, Commodity Derivatives, Interest Rate Derivatives, New Debt Segment, Repo Segment, and EGR segment.

**Market Impact:** Minimal direct market impact as this is a standard monthly operational requirement affecting trading member cost structures rather than market operations or trading activities.
