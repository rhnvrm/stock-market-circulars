## Key Points

- 4,085,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each issued at a premium of Rs. 30/- (issue price Rs. 40/-) to non-promoters on a preferential basis
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares of the company
- ISIN: INE237B01018
- Distribution Numbers: 15833966 to 19918965
- Date of Allotment: January 2, 2026
- Trading permitted from February 27, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notice for newly allotted securities.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are informed of the new securities and may trade them from the effective date. The allotted shares are subject to a lock-in period and cannot be traded until the lock-in expires.

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** January 2, 2026
- **Trading Effective From:** February 27, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry:** September 2, 2026 (all 4,085,000 shares, Dist. Nos. 15833966 to 19918965)

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact. The addition of 4,085,000 shares on a preferential basis represents a moderate expansion of the tradeable float for Jeevan Scientific Technology Limited. The lock-in until September 2, 2026 restricts near-term selling pressure from these shares. Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect from the preferential allotment at Rs. 40/- per share.
