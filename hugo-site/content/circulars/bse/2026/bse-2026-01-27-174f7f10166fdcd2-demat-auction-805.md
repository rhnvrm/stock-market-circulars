## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction involves multiple securities across various sectors. While this is a routine settlement operation, it may cause temporary price movements in affected scrips, particularly those with larger quantities under auction.

**Operational Impact:** Affects brokers and participants who have failed to deliver securities in the normal settlement cycle. These participants will need to participate in the auction or face financial consequences.

**Investor Impact:** Limited direct impact on regular investors. Primary impact is on participants with delivery failures who must fulfill obligations through the auction process, potentially at unfavorable prices.
