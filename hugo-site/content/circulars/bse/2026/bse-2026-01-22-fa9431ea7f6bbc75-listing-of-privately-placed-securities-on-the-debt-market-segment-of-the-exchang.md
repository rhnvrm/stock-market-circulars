## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it pertains to routine listing of institutional debt instruments (commercial paper) on BSE's debt segment. The securities are privately placed with face values of Rs. 5 lakhs, targeting institutional and high-net-worth investors rather than retail participants. The listings provide additional short-term funding options for the issuing companies with tenors ranging from 50 days to 364 days. All securities carry A1+ credit ratings from major rating agencies (CARE, ICRA, CRISIL), indicating highest safety for short-term debt instruments. Interest rates range from 6.90% to 8.75% p.a., reflecting current money market conditions. No impact on equity trading or broader market operations expected.
