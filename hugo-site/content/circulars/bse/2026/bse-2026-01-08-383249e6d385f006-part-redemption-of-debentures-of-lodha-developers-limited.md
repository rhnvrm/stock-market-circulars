- **Effective Date**: January 14, 2026 - Trading commences with reduced face values

## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Debenture Holders**: Moderate impact on holders of these three debenture series who will receive partial redemption proceeds. The face value reductions indicate substantial partial redemptions ranging from approximately 2.5% to 12% depending on the series.

**Market Impact**: Limited to specific debenture holders of Lodha Developers. This is a routine corporate action for debt securities and does not affect equity markets or broader market operations.

**Liquidity**: Post-redemption, the outstanding debenture amounts will be lower, which may affect secondary market liquidity for these securities.
