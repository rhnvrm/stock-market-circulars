title: Scrips Not Available for T+0 Rolling Settlement on March 30, 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has issued Notice No. 20260224-23 informing trading members that 20 equity scrips will not be available for trading under the T+0 rolling settlement cycle on Monday, March 30, 2026. Trading in these securities will only be available under the regular settlement cycle on that date.

## Key Points

- 20 scrips are excluded from the T+0 rolling settlement cycle exclusively on March 30, 2026.
- All scrips will continue to be available for trading under the regular (T+1/T+2) settlement cycle.
- The restriction is a one-day operational measure and does not affect the securities' listing status.
- Trading members are advised to plan orders and client instructions accordingly for that date.
- The notice was issued by Ketan Jantre (Head - Trading Operations) and Kaushal Mehta (Vice President – Trading Operations) on behalf of BSE Ltd.

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes are introduced. This is a temporary, date-specific operational restriction on the T+0 settlement facility for the listed scrips.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure that orders for the 20 listed scrips are not placed in the T+0 rolling settlement segment on March 30, 2026.
- Members should communicate this restriction to relevant clients who actively use the T+0 settlement cycle for these securities.
- No additional filings or documentation are required from trading members.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 24, 2026
- **Effective Date of Restriction:** March 30, 2026 (Monday)

## Impact Assessment

The restriction affects participants who rely on same-day (T+0) settlement for liquidity or intraday strategies in these 20 scrips. The affected securities span banking (Union Bank of India, Indian Bank, AU Small Finance Bank), insurance (ICICI Lombard, ICICI Prudential, LIC, Max Financial), financials (Muthoot Finance, Bajaj Housing Finance), technology (Coforge, Info Edge/Naukri), consumer/pharma (Fortis Healthcare, Mankind Pharma, Havells, Cummins India, Godrej Properties), and new-age companies (Paytm/One97 Communications, Swiggy). Traders seeking same-day settlement in these scrips must use alternative strategies or defer transactions to dates when T+0 is available.
