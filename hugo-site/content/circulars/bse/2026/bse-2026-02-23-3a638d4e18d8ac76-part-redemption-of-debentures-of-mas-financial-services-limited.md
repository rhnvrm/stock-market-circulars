---

## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that MAS Financial Services Limited has fixed 06 March 2026 as the record date for part redemption and payment of interest on two series of its Non-Convertible Debentures. Trading in both debenture series will be conducted at reduced face values effective from the same date under settlement number DR-834/2025-2026.

## Key Points

- Two NCD series of MAS Financial Services Limited are undergoing part redemption simultaneously
- Record date for both series: **06 March 2026**
- Effective date for reduced face value trading: **06 March 2026**
- Settlement number applicable: **DR-834/2025-2026**
- Series 1 (INE348L07183, Scrip Code 975528): MFSL-3 Months Bank MCLR-21-3-2 — reduced face value **Rs. 50,000 per debenture**
- Series 2 (INE348L07282, Scrip Code 976525): MFSL-1 MMCLR OF IDFC FIRST Bank — reduced face value **Rs. 75,000 per debenture**
- Circular issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This is a standard corporate action notification under existing BSE debt segment guidelines for part redemption events requiring face value adjustment in trading systems.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the reduced face values for both NCD series effective 06 March 2026
- Trades executed on or after the effective date must use the reduced face values as specified
- Members should ensure proper settlement under DR-834/2025-2026 for transactions around the record date

## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Circular Date | 23 February 2026 |
| Record Date (both series) | 06 March 2026 |
| Effective Date for Reduced Face Value | 06 March 2026 |
| Settlement Number | DR-834/2025-2026 |

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt corporate action with moderate operational impact. Debenture holders of both NCD series will receive part principal repayment along with accrued interest on the record date. Trading members dealing in these instruments must update face values in their systems from 06 March 2026 to avoid settlement discrepancies. The concurrent part redemption of two MCLR-linked NCD series suggests scheduled amortisation per the original debenture terms. Market impact is limited to existing holders of these specific privately placed debt instruments.
