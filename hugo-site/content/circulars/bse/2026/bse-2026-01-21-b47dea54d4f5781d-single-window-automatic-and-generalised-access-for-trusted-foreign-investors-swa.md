---

## Summary

SEBI has introduced the Single Window Automatic and Generalised Access for Trusted Foreign Investors (SWAGAT-FI) framework through amendments to the SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2019. This framework simplifies the on-boarding and ongoing compliance requirements for eligible FPIs including government/government-related investors, appropriately regulated retail mutual funds, insurance companies, and pension funds from identified jurisdictions. The framework enables unified account maintenance across FPI, FVCI, and other foreign investment vehicles.

## Key Points

## Impact Assessment

### Market Impact
- **Positive for Foreign Investment Flows**: Simplified registration and compliance processes likely to attract more institutional foreign capital from trusted jurisdictions
- **Enhanced Market Access**: Unified accounting framework reduces operational complexity for foreign investors managing multiple investment routes
- **Broader Investor Base**: Inclusion of retail mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies expands eligible foreign investor categories

### Operational Impact
- **DDPs and Custodians**: Need to establish new processing workflows for SWAGAT-FI applications and conversions
- **Depositories**: Significant system development required to implement unified accounting infrastructure
- **Existing FPIs**: Opportunity to streamline operations through conversion to SWAGAT-FI status if eligible

### Regulatory Impact
- **Simplified Compliance**: SWAGAT-FI framework reduces ongoing compliance burden for eligible trusted investors
- **Risk-Based Approach**: Framework focuses on regulated entities from identified jurisdictions, balancing ease of access with investor quality
- **Standard Operating Procedures**: CDSSF to develop detailed implementation guidelines defining eligible jurisdictions and regulators

### Strategic Considerations
- Framework aligns with India's objective to attract long-term institutional capital from reputable sources
- Blind pool requirement ensures diversification and reduces concentration risks
- Independence of investment managers from contributors provides governance safeguards
- Unified accounting reduces fragmentation in foreign investment routes (FPI/FVCI/other vehicles)
