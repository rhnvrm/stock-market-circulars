## Summary

BSE has assigned a new ISIN number INE890G01047 for the equity shares of United Van Der Horst Ltd (Scrip Code: 522091) following the sub-division of equity shares from Rs.5/- to Re.1/-. The new ISIN will be effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of January 22, 2026.

## Key Points

- Company: United Van Der Horst Ltd (Scrip Code: 522091)
- New ISIN Number: INE890G01047
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.5/- to Re.1/-
- New face value: Re.1/- per equity share
- Debit Reference: DR-804/2025-2026
- This notice is in continuation to Exchange Notice No. 20260107-19 dated January 07, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an administrative update following a corporate action (share sub-division) previously announced.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN number INE890G01047 for all trades in United Van Der Horst Ltd equity shares executed on or after January 22, 2026
- Systems and records must be updated to reflect the new ISIN for the Re.1/- face value shares

## Important Dates

- Notice Date: January 19, 2026
- Ex-Date: January 22, 2026 (new ISIN effective from this date)
- Reference to Previous Notice: January 07, 2026 (Notice No. 20260107-19)

## Impact Assessment

Low impact administrative change affecting only United Van Der Horst Ltd. Trading members need to update their systems with the new ISIN number for trades executed from the ex-date onwards. The share sub-division increases the number of shares while reducing the face value proportionally, making shares more affordable for retail investors without changing the overall market capitalization.
