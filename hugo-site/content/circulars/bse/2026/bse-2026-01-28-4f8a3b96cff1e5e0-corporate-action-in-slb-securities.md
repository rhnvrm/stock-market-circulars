## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium impact on the Securities Lending and Borrowing market. Institutional investors and market makers who rely on SLB mechanisms for short-term liquidity or hedging strategies will need to plan around these shut periods.

**Operational Impact:** SLB participants must adjust their lending and borrowing strategies for these 17 securities during the specified periods. This may temporarily reduce liquidity in the SLB market for these stocks.

**Investor Impact:** Primarily affects institutional investors, hedge funds, and proprietary trading desks that actively participate in securities lending programs. Retail investors are generally not impacted unless they participate in SLB schemes.
