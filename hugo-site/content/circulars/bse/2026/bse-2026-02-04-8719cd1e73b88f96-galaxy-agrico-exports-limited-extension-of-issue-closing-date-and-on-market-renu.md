## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The extension provides additional time for eligible shareholders to participate in the rights issue, potentially increasing subscription rates. This is a shareholder-friendly move that may positively impact participation.

**Operational Impact**: The 7-day extension affects the timeline for post-issue activities and subsequent corporate actions. Shareholders who were planning based on the original timeline need to be aware of the revised dates.

**Investor Impact**: Eligible shareholders gain an additional week to arrange funds, evaluate the offer, and submit applications. On-market renunciation participants have until February 12, 2026 instead of February 5, 2026 to trade their rights entitlements.
