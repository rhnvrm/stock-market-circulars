## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment increases the equity base of TITAN INTECH LIMITED by 51.50 lakh shares.

This represents a standard capital raising activity through warrant conversion with no broader implications for market operations or other listed entities.
