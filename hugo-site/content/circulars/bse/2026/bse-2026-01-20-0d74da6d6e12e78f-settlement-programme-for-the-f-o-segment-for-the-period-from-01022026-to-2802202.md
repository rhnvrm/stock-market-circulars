## Summary

BSE has announced the daily settlement schedule for the Futures & Options (F&O) segment for February 2026. The notice provides trade dates and corresponding settlement dates for the entire month, following the standard T+1 settlement cycle.

## Key Points

- Settlement schedule covers period from February 1, 2026 to February 28, 2026
- Standard T+1 settlement cycle applies (settlement occurs one business day after trade date)
- One exception: trades on February 18, 2026 will settle on February 20, 2026 (marked with @)
- Final settlement for February 27, 2026 trades occurs on March 2, 2026
- Notice issued by Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd.

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational schedule announcement.

## Compliance Requirements

Market participants must ensure:
- Adequate funds/securities available for settlement obligations on specified dates
- Timely completion of pay-in and pay-out processes as per the schedule
- Adherence to settlement timelines for derivatives trades

## Important Dates

- **February 1-28, 2026**: F&O segment operational dates
- **February 18, 2026**: Trade date with extended settlement (settles on Feb 20 instead of Feb 19)
- **February 19, 2026**: Market holiday (no trading)
- **March 2, 2026**: Settlement date for February 27, 2026 trades

## Impact Assessment

Routine administrative notice with minimal market impact. The settlement schedule follows standard practices with T+1 settlement cycle. The only notable adjustment is the extended settlement for February 18 trades due to the February 19 market holiday. Market participants should plan their cash flow and margin requirements accordingly for the month.
