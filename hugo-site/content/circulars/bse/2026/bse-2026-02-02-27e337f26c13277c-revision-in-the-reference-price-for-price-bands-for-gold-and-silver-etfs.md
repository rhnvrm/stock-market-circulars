## Summary

BSE has issued guidelines for determining the reference price for Gold and Silver Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) for trading on February 3, 2026. The reference price will be based on the latest available Net Asset Value (NAV) as of February 2, 2026. If the latest NAV is unavailable, the closing price as of February 2, 2026 will be used. The standard price band of ±20% will apply to this reference price.

## Key Points

- Reference price for Gold and Silver ETFs to be based on latest available NAV as of February 2, 2026
- If NAV is unavailable, closing price as of February 2, 2026 will be used as reference price
- Price band of ±20% applicable to the reference price
- Effective for trading purposes on February 3, 2026
- Notice issued by Ketan Jantre, Head – Trading Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular clarifies the existing methodology for determining reference prices for Gold and Silver ETFs.

## Compliance Requirements
