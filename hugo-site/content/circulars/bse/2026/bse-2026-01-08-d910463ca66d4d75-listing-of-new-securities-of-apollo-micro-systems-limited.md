## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 12.1 million shares represents a significant capital raise through preferential allotment. The lock-in periods (1-3 years) provide some stability by preventing immediate selling pressure. 

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders experience dilution from this preferential issuance. The shares are issued to both Promoters and Non-Promoters, which may impact ownership structure.

**Liquidity Impact**: Limited immediate impact on free float due to lock-in restrictions. Only after July 2026 will the first tranche of 14.6 lakh shares become tradeable, with the remaining 1.07 crore shares unlocking in July 2027.
