## Compliance Requirements

- No new SLB transactions can be initiated in these securities during the shut period
- Existing open positions must be settled before the shut period begins
- Market participants should plan their SLB strategies accounting for these restrictions

## Important Dates

- **First Shut Period Start**: February 10, 2026 (Page Industries)
- **Last Shut Period End**: February 18, 2026 (ONGC)
- **Peak Period**: February 12-13, 2026 (13 securities affected)

## Impact Assessment

This circular has moderate impact on the SLB market segment. The shut periods prevent lending and borrowing activities for these securities during critical dividend-related dates, which may:

- Temporarily reduce liquidity in the SLB market for affected securities
- Require SLB participants to plan position management in advance
- Prevent potential settlement failures related to corporate actions
- Ensure dividend entitlements are correctly allocated to rightful holders
- Affect short-selling strategies that rely on SLB mechanisms

The inclusion of large-cap stocks like ONGC, MRF, and Sun TV may have more significant market impact compared to smaller securities on the list.
