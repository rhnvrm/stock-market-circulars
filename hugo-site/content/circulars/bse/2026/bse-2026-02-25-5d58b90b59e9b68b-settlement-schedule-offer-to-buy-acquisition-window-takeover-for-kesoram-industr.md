## Impact Assessment

This circular directly affects members and custodians participating in the takeover acquisition window for Kesoram Industries Limited. Timely compliance with early pay-in requirements is critical; failure to reflect securities in BSE/ICCL systems before prescribed deadlines may result in rejected bids. The multi-week window (26 Feb – 12 Mar 2026) provides operational lead time, but settlement obligations are firm. Market participants holding or dealing in Kesoram Industries shares should coordinate depository operations promptly to meet the 18 March 2026 settlement.
