## Summary

BSE has issued a circular announcing the allocation of equity shares to anchor investors in the public issue (IPO) of Accord Transformer and Switchgear Limited. Anchor investor allocation is a regulatory requirement under SEBI guidelines, carried out one trading day before the public issue opens. This circular provides details of the institutional/anchor investor allotment.

## Key Points

- Anchor investor allocation has been completed as per SEBI ICDR Regulations.
- The circular notifies the exchange and market participants of the anchor allotment details, including the number of shares allocated and the anchor issue price.
- Anchor investors are typically Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) who receive shares at a price determined prior to the public issue opening.
- The anchor allotment price sets a reference point for the IPO price band.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. The allocation follows existing SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018, which mandate anchor investor allocation one day prior to opening of the public issue.

## Compliance Requirements

- The company and its Book Running Lead Managers (BRLMs) must ensure anchor investor lock-in requirements are met (30-day lock-in for anchor investors as per SEBI regulations).
- BSE members and trading participants are required to note the anchor allotment details for settlement and listing purposes.

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a moderate market impact limited to participants in the IPO of Accord Transformer and Switchgear Limited. The anchor investor allocation signals institutional interest in the company's public issue and provides price discovery ahead of the retail subscription window. Retail and non-institutional investors can use the anchor allotment price as a reference for evaluating the IPO. The listing on BSE following the public issue will result in a new equity security being available for trading on the exchange.
