## Summary

BSE has announced the applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) effective February 06, 2026. The circular lists 25 securities being shortlisted in the Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework, 1 security moving to higher stage ASM while continuing in ST-ASM, and 8 securities moving out of the ST-ASM framework. The surveillance measure is designed to monitor securities exhibiting abnormal price movements and protect investor interests.

## Key Points

- 25 securities shortlisted for Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework from February 06, 2026
- Includes both regular market and SME scrips (marked with @)
- Some securities marked with (*) are as per NSE alignment
- Hit Kit Global Solutions Ltd moving to higher stage ASM while continuing in framework
- 8 securities exiting ST-ASM framework including Alphalogic Techsys, B2B Software Technologies, Franklin Leasing, Grameva, Indo Euro Indchem, Kitex Garments, Meera Industries, and Rajkot Investment Trust
- Securities may exit ST-ASM due to inclusion in other frameworks (LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge, ESM)
- Framework applies to T+0 scrips based on parent company criteria

## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance on securities showing unusual price and volume movements over short periods (5/15/30 days). Securities under this framework are subject to additional monitoring and potential trading restrictions to curb excessive speculation and protect retail investors. The framework is periodically reviewed and securities are added or removed based on their price-volume behavior.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with additional surveillance requirements for listed securities
- Price discovery restrictions may apply based on ASM stage
- Additional margin requirements may be applicable for positions in ST-ASM securities
- Members should inform clients about securities under surveillance measures
- Enhanced disclosure and monitoring obligations for trades in affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 06, 2026 - ST-ASM measures applicable for listed securities
- **Circular Date**: February 05, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The inclusion of 25 securities in ST-ASM framework will result in enhanced surveillance and potential trading restrictions, affecting liquidity and trading patterns in these scrips. Traders and investors holding positions in these securities should expect increased monitoring and possible margin requirements.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the surveillance status and communicate the same to clients. The framework aims to reduce excessive volatility and speculative trading in the affected securities.

**Investor Impact**: Retail investors should exercise caution while trading in ST-ASM securities as these have exhibited abnormal price movements. The surveillance measure provides a layer of protection but also indicates higher risk profiles for these stocks.
