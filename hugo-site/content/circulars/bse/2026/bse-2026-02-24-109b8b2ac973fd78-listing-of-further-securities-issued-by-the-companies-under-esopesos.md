## Impact Assessment

Market impact is minimal. ESOP/ESOS listings represent relatively small additions to the existing equity float for each company. The largest addition is HDFC Bank with 1,360,302 shares, which is negligible relative to its multi-billion share capital. Xtglobal Infotech's 561,500 shares may have a proportionally higher impact given its smaller market cap. No price-sensitive information is contained in this circular.
