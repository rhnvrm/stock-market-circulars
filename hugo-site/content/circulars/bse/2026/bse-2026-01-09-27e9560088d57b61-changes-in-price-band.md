title: Changes in Price Band for 35 Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for 35 securities effective from January 12, 2026. The revised price bands range from 1% to 20%, replacing the existing levels. This is a surveillance measure to manage price volatility in these securities. Trading members have been notified to implement these changes from the effective date.

## Key Points

- 35 securities will have revised price bands effective January 12, 2026
- New price bands range from 1% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive)
- Four securities get 1% price band: Deccan Bearings Ltd, Filtron Engineers Ltd, Onix Solar Energy Ltd
- Three securities get 20% price band: Narmada Agrobase Ltd, Shree Refrigerations Ltd, Sigma Solve Ltd
- Majority of securities (19 out of 35) receive 5% or 10% price bands
- Members can contact bse.surv@bseindia.com for clarifications

## Regulatory Changes

This circular represents a surveillance action by BSE to revise price bands from existing levels. The price band mechanism restricts the maximum price movement (up or down) that a security can undergo in a single trading session. Tighter bands (1-5%) indicate higher surveillance concerns, while wider bands (10-20%) allow more price discovery within controlled limits.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement the revised price bands in their trading systems effective January 12, 2026
- All trades in these 35 securities must comply with the new price band restrictions
- Members should ensure their risk management systems are updated to reflect the new bands
- Any clarifications should be sought from BSE Surveillance Department at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 9, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 12, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revised price bands will directly affect trading in these 35 securities by limiting intraday price movements. Securities with tighter bands (1-5%) will experience restricted volatility, which may reduce liquidity but protect against excessive speculation. Securities with wider bands (10-20%) will have more room for price discovery.

**Trading Impact**: Traders and investors in these securities need to be aware that price movements will be capped at the specified percentages. Orders placed beyond the price band limits will be rejected. The tighter bands suggest these securities are under enhanced surveillance, potentially due to concerns about volatility, low liquidity, or other market integrity issues.

**Investor Consideration**: The presence of securities on this list, particularly those with very tight bands (1-2%), may indicate higher risk or surveillance concerns that investors should factor into their investment decisions.
