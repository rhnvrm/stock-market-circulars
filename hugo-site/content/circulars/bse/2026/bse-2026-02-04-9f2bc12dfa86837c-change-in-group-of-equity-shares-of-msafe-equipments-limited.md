This follows the exchange's earlier notice dated February 3, 2026.

## Key Points

- Company: MSAFE EQUIPMENTS LIMITED (SME IPO)
- Scrip Code: 544695
- Current Segment: Trade for Trade (MT Group)

- Effective Date: February 18, 2026

- Previous Notice: 20260203-45 dated February 3, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for MSAFE EQUIPMENTS LIMITED shares will change from Trade for Trade settlement to Rolling settlement, allowing for more liquid trading conditions. This represents a graduation from the stricter T4T framework typically applied to newly listed SME stocks.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members should:
- Update their systems to reflect the group change from MT to M Group
- Adjust trading strategies as the stock moves to rolling settlement
- Contact Mr. Anurag Jain (Tel: 022-2272 8822) for further clarification if needed

## Important Dates

- **February 3, 2026**: Initial notice issued (20260203-45)
- **February 4, 2026**: Confirmation notice issued (20260204-6)
- **February 18, 2026**: Effective date for group transfer to M Group/Rolling segment

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The shift to rolling settlement typically increases liquidity and reduces settlement risk, making the stock more accessible to regular traders. This is a positive development for the stock's tradability.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Trading members need to update internal systems and risk management parameters to accommodate the new settlement cycle, but this is a routine operational adjustment.

**Investor Impact**: Medium - Investors will benefit from improved liquidity and the ability to conduct intraday trading, though they should be aware of the change in settlement mechanics.
