## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 139 scrips but quantities are relatively small for most stocks except STEEL AUTHORITY (60,000 shares), GHCL Textile (2,000 shares), and a few others. The auction indicates delivery failures in the previous settlement cycle.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Brokers with delivery failures must arrange funds/securities for auction participation. Clients who failed to deliver will face auction losses and potential penalties.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Specific investors/traders who had open positions in these scrips for the settlement period may face auction charges. Broader market participants are not directly affected.

**Liquidity Impact:** Low - Auction quantities are small relative to typical trading volumes for most large-cap stocks. However, for smaller stocks with limited liquidity, the auction could cause temporary price movements.
