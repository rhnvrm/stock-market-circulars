## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must apply trade-for-trade settlement restrictions for securities newly added to the ESM framework
- Applicable margin and surveillance requirements per ESM stage must be enforced from March 02, 2026
- Clients holding positions in affected securities should be informed of the change in surveillance status
- Securities moving out of ESM revert to standard settlement unless otherwise classified (e.g., SMP or IBC frameworks)

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 27, 2026
- **Effective Date for all ESM changes:** March 02, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a high market impact for retail and institutional investors holding positions in the 20 affected securities. Newly added ESM securities face enhanced scrutiny and trade-for-trade settlement, which significantly restricts intraday trading and may reduce liquidity. The 11 securities exiting ESM may see improved sentiment and liquidity as surveillance restrictions are lifted. The 5 securities moving to a lower ESM stage will benefit from reduced restrictions. Traders and investors in these scrips should review their positions ahead of the March 02, 2026 effective date.
