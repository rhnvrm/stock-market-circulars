title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Securities Moving into GSM Stages (February
  25, 2026)
---

## Summary

BSE has placed 8 securities under the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework as of February 25, 2026. The securities have been moved into Stages I through IV based on their trading patterns and risk profiles. GSM imposes progressively stricter trading restrictions at higher stages to protect investors from potential price manipulation and abnormal volatility.

## Key Points

- 8 securities in total have been moved into the GSM framework across four stages.
- Stage I: 2 securities — Rishab Special Yarns Ltd (514177) and Gconnect Logitech and Supply Chain Ltd (544156).
- Stage II: 3 securities — MFS Intercorp Ltd (513721), Mayur Floorings Ltd (531221), and Yuranus Infrastructure Ltd (536846).
- Stage III: 2 securities — VR Woodart Ltd (523888) and Purohit Construction Ltd (538993).
- Stage IV: 1 security — Meyer Apparel Ltd (531613).
- Securities marked (#) may move to a lower GSM stage due to inclusion in the ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure) framework.
- Securities marked ($) may move to a lower GSM stage due to inclusion in the IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) framework.

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework introduces trade-by-trade settlement and price band restrictions on identified securities. Higher GSM stages impose progressively stricter conditions:
- **Stage I**: Trade-to-trade settlement with a 5% price band.
- **Stage II**: Trade-to-trade settlement with a 2% price band.
- **Stage III**: Trade-to-trade settlement with a 2% price band; only buyers allowed.
- **Stage IV**: Trading permitted only once a month on the first Monday, with a 2% price band; only buyers allowed.

Meyer Apparel Ltd (531613) faces the most severe restrictions at Stage IV.

## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers and trading members must ensure clients are aware of the GSM status and restrictions before facilitating trades in these securities.
- Investors holding these securities should note that selling may be restricted or subject to special settlement procedures depending on the applicable GSM stage.
- No short selling is permitted in GSM-listed securities.
- Exchanges and depositories will enforce the applicable trade-to-trade settlement mandatorily.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 25, 2026 — the circular is issued and securities are to be treated under the respective GSM stages from this date.

## Impact Assessment

The placement of these securities under GSM has a significant direct impact on their holders and traders:
- **Liquidity risk**: Securities under GSM — particularly Stages III and IV — face severely reduced liquidity due to buy-only restrictions and infrequent trading windows.
- **Price discovery**: Tight price bands (2–5%) limit price movement, which can cause artificial price suppression or prevent mark-to-market adjustments.
- **Investor confidence**: GSM inclusion signals regulatory concern about the quality or trading behavior of these securities, which may further reduce investor interest.
- **Meyer Apparel Ltd** (Stage IV) is effectively illiquid for most of the month, with trading permitted only once monthly.
- Market participants with positions in these 8 securities should reassess risk exposure and be aware of the applicable settlement and trading constraints.
