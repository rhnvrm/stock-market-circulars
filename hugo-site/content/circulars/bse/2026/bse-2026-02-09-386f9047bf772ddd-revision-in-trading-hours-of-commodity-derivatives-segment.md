## Summary

BSE has announced a revision in trading hours for the Commodity Derivatives Segment effective March 09, 2026. This change is necessitated by the shift in US daylight saving timings. The new schedule extends continuous trading hours for internationally referenceable non-agricultural commodities from 9:00 AM to 11:30 PM, with trade modification timings at 11:45 PM.

## Key Points

- Revised trading hours effective from March 09, 2026

- References previous notice 20250929-55 dated September 29, 2025
- Continuous trading session: 9:00 AM to 11:30 PM
- Trade modification window: 11:45 PM

## Regulatory Changes

This circular updates the trading hours framework previously communicated in Exchange notice no 20250929-55 dated September 29, 2025. The revision aligns BSE's commodity derivatives trading schedule with international market timings following the US daylight saving time change.

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Trading members will need to adjust their operational schedules, risk management systems, and trading infrastructure to accommodate the revised hours. This is a routine annual adjustment tied to international market synchronization.
