## Impact Assessment

This is a routine monthly compliance notice affecting all BSE trading members who have turnover across any of the covered segments (Cash, Derivatives, Currency Derivatives, Commodity Derivatives, Interest Rate Derivatives, New Debt, Repo, and EGR). The operational impact is limited to ensuring adequate liquidity in settlement accounts by March 05, 2026. The relevant fee files are TF2A through TF2J (suffixed by month-year: mmyy). No market-wide trading impact is expected; this is purely an administrative and financial compliance requirement.
