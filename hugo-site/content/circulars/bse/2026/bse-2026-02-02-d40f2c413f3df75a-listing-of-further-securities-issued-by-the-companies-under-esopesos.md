- Largest issuance: HDFC Bank Limited with 1,219,698 shares (Face Value: ₹1)
- Second largest: ICICI Bank Limited with 765,234 shares (Face Value: ₹2)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for employee stock option exercises under existing SEBI ESOP regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must take note of the newly listed securities
- Trading systems should be updated to reflect the increased share capital for these companies
- Companies have complied with ESOP/ESOS listing requirements under applicable regulations
- Distinctive numbers assigned for tracking purposes (From and To range provided for each company)

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 2, 2026
- **Trading Commencement Date:** Tuesday, February 3, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry:** Not Applicable (NA) - No lock-in restrictions on any of the securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. ESOP/ESOS issuances represent standard employee compensation practices and typically involve small percentages of outstanding share capital. The dilution effect is marginal for all companies listed.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible immediate impact. ESOP shares often have gradual market entry as employees decide individual selling timelines.

**Company-Specific Impact:** 
- Banking stocks (HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank) see larger absolute numbers but minimal percentage dilution given their large market capitalizations
- Smaller companies like Kernex Microsystems (43,000 shares at ₹10 face value) have proportionally minor additions
- No lock-in restrictions mean shares can be traded immediately, though employee holding patterns typically result in gradual market entry

**Investor Considerations:** Routine corporate action requiring awareness but no immediate trading strategy adjustments. Updated share capital figures should be noted for valuation purposes.
