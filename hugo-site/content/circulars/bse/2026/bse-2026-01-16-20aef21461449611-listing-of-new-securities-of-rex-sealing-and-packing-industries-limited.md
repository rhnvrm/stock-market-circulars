## Summary

BSE has announced the listing of 56,000 new equity shares of Rex Sealing and Packing Industries Limited (Scrip Code: 543744) effective January 19, 2026. These shares were issued at Rs. 210/- per share (face value Rs. 10/- plus premium of Rs. 200/-) to non-promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to conversion of warrants. The shares are subject to lock-in until July 31, 2026.

## Key Points

- Number of shares: 56,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each
- Issue price: Rs. 210/- per share (Rs. 10/- face value + Rs. 200/- premium)
- Allotment basis: Preferential allotment to non-promoters pursuant to warrant conversion
- Date of allotment: September 26, 2025
- Distinctive numbers: 2220001 to 2276000
- ISIN: INE0MFT01014
- Scrip code: 543744
- Ranking: Pari-passu with existing equity shares
- Lock-in period: All 56,000 shares locked until July 31, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification for new securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the listing of these new securities
- Lock-in restrictions must be enforced until July 31, 2026 for all 56,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 2220001 to 2276000)

## Important Dates

- **Date of allotment**: September 26, 2025
- **Trading commencement date**: January 19, 2026 (Monday)
- **Lock-in expiry date**: July 31, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. The listing involves a relatively small number of shares (56,000) issued to non-promoters on a preferential basis. The complete lock-in until July 31, 2026 means these shares cannot be traded freely for approximately 6.5 months from listing date, limiting immediate supply. This is a routine corporate action following warrant conversion and is unlikely to significantly affect the stock's trading pattern or liquidity.
