## Summary

SEBI has issued a comprehensive Master Circular consolidating all applicable regulations, guidelines, and directives for Investment Advisers. This circular replaces and rescinds all previous individual circulars listed in its appendix while preserving their legal effect for past actions and ongoing proceedings. The master circular covers six major areas: guidelines for Investment Advisers, conduct strengthening measures, administration and supervision framework, technology requirements, investor complaint redressal, and miscellaneous provisions including change in control procedures and advertisement codes.

## Key Points
