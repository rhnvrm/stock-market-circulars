## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects specific securities where delivery shortages have occurred. The high quantity for Tilak Ventures (over 5.9 million shares) suggests significant delivery failure that could impact price discovery and liquidity.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Members with short positions in these securities must arrange funds/securities for auction participation. Large quantities in certain scrips may indicate liquidity challenges or settlement issues.

**Member Impact**: Direct impact on brokers/clearing members who have failed to deliver securities in the normal settlement cycle, requiring them to purchase securities through auction at potentially unfavorable prices.
