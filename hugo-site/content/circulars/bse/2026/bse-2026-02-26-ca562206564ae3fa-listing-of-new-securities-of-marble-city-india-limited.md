## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to permit trading in these securities from February 27, 2026
- Lock-in restrictions apply to all 2,50,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 23325109 to 23575108) until August 31, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 2,50,000 equity shares to the tradeable float of Marble City India Limited, though the entire tranche remains under lock-in until August 31, 2026, meaning no immediate increase in free-float liquidity. Market impact is minimal given the small share count and lock-in restriction. The preferential allotment at Rs. 100.50/- per share represents the conversion price for warrant holders.
