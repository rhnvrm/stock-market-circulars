## Regulatory Framework

The Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) is applied to securities showing abnormal price movements or unusual trading patterns. Securities under this framework are subject to:
- Enhanced surveillance monitoring
- Potential trading restrictions in 5/15/30 day cycles
- Stage-wise progression based on continued unusual activity
- Price bands and additional margin requirements

Securities may exit ST-ASM by entering other surveillance frameworks including LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM (Graded Surveillance Measure), Pledge Framework, or ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure).

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 16, 2026
- **Circular Date**: January 14, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 4 securities and removal of 7 securities represents routine surveillance activity. Investors and traders in these specific securities will need to be aware of enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions.

**Operational Impact**: Securities added to ST-ASM framework will face increased scrutiny, potential price bands, and additional margin requirements. This may reduce liquidity and increase volatility in affected scrips. Securities moving out of ST-ASM will have restrictions lifted, potentially improving trading conditions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding positions in newly added securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance measures and potential additional compliance requirements. Those holding securities exiting the framework may see improved market conditions.
