**Operational Impact:** Medium - affects brokers and trading members who have failed to deliver securities. They will need to participate in the auction and face potential losses due to auction pricing mechanisms.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - retail investors not directly impacted unless they are clients of members with delivery failures. Some price volatility may occur in stocks with larger auction quantities during the auction process.
