---

## Summary

SEBI has clarified that no directions were issued against Mr Dharmendra R Shah in the final order (WTM/MPB/EFD-1-DRA1/25/2018 dated July 27, 2018) related to SMS Techsoft India Limited. Consequently, SEBI has directed the exchange to unfreeze the PAN ACDPS9920N belonging to Mr Dharmendra R Shah. This is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20180727-38 dated July 27, 2018.

## Key Points

- No directions were issued against Mr Dharmendra R Shah in the final SEBI order dated July 27, 2018
- SEBI directs unfreezing of PAN: ACDPS9920N (belonging to Dharmendra R Shah)
- This clarification follows up on the original Exchange Notice No. 20180727-38 dated July 27, 2018
- Trading members are required to take note and ensure compliance

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a clarification and reversal of a previous administrative action based on the determination that no directions were issued against the individual in question.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the unfreezing of Mr Dharmendra R Shah's PAN (ACDPS9920N)
- Ensure compliance with the directive
- Refer to the full SEBI order available on www.sebi.gov.in for complete details

## Important Dates

- **February 02, 2026**: SEBI email communication and BSE circular date
- **July 27, 2018**: Date of original SEBI order (WTM/MPB/EFD-1-DRA1/25/2018)
- **July 27, 2018**: Date of original Exchange Notice No. 20180727-38

## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it is an administrative correction affecting a single individual. The unfreezing of the PAN removes restrictions previously in place, but since no directions were actually issued in the final order, this represents a clarification rather than a substantive change. Market participants should note this for record-keeping and compliance purposes only.
