## Summary

BSE has notified Demat Auction No. 827 for the settlement dated 25 February 2026. The auction lists 95 securities across various sectors where delivery obligations were not fulfilled, requiring compulsory purchase through the auction mechanism to settle outstanding obligations.

## Key Points

- Auction Settlement No.: 827
- Settlement Date: 25/02/2026
- Total scrips listed for auction: 95
- Largest quantity: Alstone Textiles (539277) — 170,025 shares
- Other significant quantities: ITC Ltd (500875) — 164,800 shares; Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (544026) — 62,100 shares; Sawaca Enterprises (531893) — 50,000 shares; Ashapura Minechem (527001) — 8,500 shares

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard auction notice under BSE's existing demat auction framework for handling delivery failures in the equity segment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers/members with outstanding delivery obligations in the listed securities must participate or comply with auction settlement procedures.
- Members who are buyers in failed deliveries will receive shares through the auction or cash settlement at auction prices.
- Selling members who failed to deliver will be debited at the auction settlement price plus applicable penalties.

## Important Dates

- Auction Date: 25 February 2026
- Settlement No.: 827

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational notice. The auction affects market participants (brokers and their clients) who have unresolved delivery obligations in the 95 listed scrips. The presence of high-volume blue-chip stocks such as ITC (164,800 shares), Reliance Industries (10,030 shares), and Bajaj Finance (7,500 shares) indicates meaningful settlement shortfalls. Buyers in these scrips will receive delivery through the auction mechanism. No broader market policy impact is anticipated.
