## Impact Assessment

This corporate action affects holders of Lendingkart Finance Limited's non-convertible debentures (LFL-11.95%-30-10-26-PVT series). The part redemption will result in a reduced face value of Rs. 25,000 per debenture. Debenture holders as of the record date will receive interest payment and partial redemption proceeds. Post-redemption, the debentures will trade at the reduced face value, which may affect liquidity and pricing calculations. This is a standard debt market corporate action with limited broader market impact.
