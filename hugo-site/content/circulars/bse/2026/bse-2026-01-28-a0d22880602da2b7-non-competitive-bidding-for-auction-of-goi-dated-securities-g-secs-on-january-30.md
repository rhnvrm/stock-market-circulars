## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine government securities auction announcement that facilitates participation by retail and institutional investors through the non-competitive route. 

**Operational Impact**: Low. Only affects trading members and investors interested in participating in G-sec auctions. The established NCB-GSec module provides a streamlined process for participation.

**Stakeholder Impact**: Limited to government securities market participants. The non-competitive bidding facility allows smaller investors to participate in primary G-sec auctions without competing with large institutional bidders, promoting financial inclusion in the debt market.

**Contact Teams**: BSE has provided comprehensive contact information for trading operations (user creation, bidding queries) and ICCL operations (settlement and pay-in queries) to ensure smooth participation process.
