## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited. This is a company-specific listing event affecting only Rnit Ai Solutions Limited. The preferential allotment to strategic investors represents a capital infusion under a court-approved resolution plan, suggesting potential corporate restructuring or revival efforts.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal for general market participants. Investors interested in the scrip should note the lock-in period extends until February 14, 2027, preventing immediate liquidity for these shares. The issuance increases the total equity base of the company by 47.33 lakh shares.

**Investor Consideration**: The shares were issued at Rs. 44/- under a preferential allotment scheme as part of an NCLT-approved resolution plan, indicating the company may have undergone insolvency or restructuring proceedings.
