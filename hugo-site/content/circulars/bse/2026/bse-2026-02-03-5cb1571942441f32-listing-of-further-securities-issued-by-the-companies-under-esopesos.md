## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The total number of shares being listed represents a small percentage increase in the outstanding equity for each company. The largest single listing is 218,250 shares for Bazel International.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible impact on overall market liquidity as the share quantities are relatively small and there are no lock-in restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Neutral. ESOP share listings are routine corporate actions that typically have minimal immediate price impact. The absence of lock-in periods means these shares are immediately available for trading if holders choose to sell.

**Operational Impact**: Standard listing procedure requiring no special trading arrangements or market participant actions beyond awareness of the additional float.
