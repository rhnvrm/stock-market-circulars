title: Listing of Further Securities Issued Under ESOP/ESOS - 15 Companies
---

## Summary

BSE has approved the listing of further securities issued by 15 companies under their Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOS). The new securities will be admitted for trading on the Exchange with effect from Tuesday, February 10, 2026. A total of 1,573,906 new shares across all companies will be listed, with no lock-in period applicable to any of the securities.

## Key Points

- 15 companies have issued new securities under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Total shares being listed: 1,573,906 shares
- Effective trading date: February 10, 2026
- No lock-in period applies to any of the listed securities
- Largest issuances by share count: Ather Energy (494,266 shares), Go Digit (156,605 shares), Mphasis (110,719 shares)
- Face values range from Re 1 to Rs 10 per share depending on the company
- All securities are in the equity segment

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine listing notification for securities already issued under approved ESOP/ESOS schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must take note of the new securities being listed
- Companies have completed the necessary listing formalities
- Distribution numbers have been assigned to the new shares for each company

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** February 9, 2026
- **Listing and Trading Commencement Date:** February 10, 2026
- **Lock-in Period:** Not applicable (NA) for all companies

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal to low. The listing represents routine ESOP/ESOS allotments which are typically small relative to the total outstanding shares of the companies involved. For large-cap companies like ICICI Bank (21,153 shares) and Marico (20,639 shares), the dilution is negligible.

**Liquidity Impact:** Neutral. The shares are immediately tradable with no lock-in restrictions, but the volumes are unlikely to materially affect market liquidity given the relatively small quantities.

**Corporate Action:** Positive for employee stock option holders as shares become freely tradable immediately upon listing.
