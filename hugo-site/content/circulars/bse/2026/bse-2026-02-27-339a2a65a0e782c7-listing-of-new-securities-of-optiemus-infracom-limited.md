## Impact Assessment

The listing adds 3,04,291 shares (~0.34 lakh shares) to the tradeable float of Optiemus Infracom Limited from March 2, 2026, representing a modest increase in equity capital. The lock-in period until September 10, 2026 restricts immediate secondary market activity for these shares, limiting near-term dilution impact on existing shareholders. The issue price of Rs. 672.25/- serves as a reference benchmark for market participants. Overall market impact is low and routine.
