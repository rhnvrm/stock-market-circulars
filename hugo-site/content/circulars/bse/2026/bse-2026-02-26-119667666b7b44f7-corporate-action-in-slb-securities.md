title: Corporate Action in SLB Securities - Dividend, Stock Split and Rights Issue
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular listing corporate actions for securities under the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) framework. Four securities are affected by upcoming corporate actions — dividends, a stock split, and a rights issue — with record/ex-dates between 26 February and 13 March 2026. SLB participants holding these securities must observe the specified shut periods.

## Key Points

- **SBI Life Insurance Company Limited** is subject to a **Dividend** with a book closure/record date and ex-date of 06 March 2026; shut period is 05-Mar-2026 to 06-Mar-2026.
- **Angel One Limited** is undergoing a **Stock Split** with an ex-date of 26 February 2026 (same day as circular); shut period is 25-Feb-2026 to 26-Feb-2026.
- **Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC)** is subject to a **Dividend** with a book closure/record date and ex-date of 13 March 2026; shut period is 12-Mar-2026 to 13-Mar-2026.
- **HealthCare Global Enterprises Limited** is conducting a **Rights Issue of Equity Shares** with a record/ex-date of 02 March 2026 and a foreclosure date of 02 March 2026; shut period is 27-Feb-2026 to 02-Mar-2026.
- No foreclosure dates are applicable for dividend and stock split actions.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes are introduced. This circular is an operational notice under the existing SLB framework, informing participants of corporate actions that trigger shut periods during which lending/borrowing of affected securities is restricted.

## Compliance Requirements

- SLB participants must ensure no new lending or borrowing positions are opened in the affected securities during the respective shut periods.
- Existing SLB positions in HealthCare Global Enterprises must be settled or recalled before the foreclosure date of 02 March 2026.
- Participants should reconcile their SLB positions for Angel One Limited immediately, as the stock split ex-date is 26 February 2026 (the date of this circular).

## Important Dates

| Security | Action | Ex / Record Date | Foreclosure Date | Shut Period |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SBI Life Insurance | Dividend | 06 Mar 2026 | — | 05 Mar – 06 Mar 2026 |
| Angel One Limited | Stock Split | 26 Feb 2026 | — | 25 Feb – 26 Feb 2026 |
| IRFC | Dividend | 13 Mar 2026 | — | 12 Mar – 13 Mar 2026 |
| HealthCare Global Enterprises | Rights Issue | 02 Mar 2026 | 02 Mar 2026 | 27 Feb – 02 Mar 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

SLB participants holding positions in any of the four listed securities must act promptly. The Angel One stock split is effective on the same day as this circular (26 Feb 2026), requiring immediate attention. The HealthCare Global Enterprises rights issue carries an additional foreclosure date, meaning open SLB positions must be closed before 02 March 2026 or they will be forcibly closed by the exchange. Dividend-related shut periods for SBI Life and IRFC provide slightly more lead time. Overall market impact is moderate, limited to SLB desks and institutional participants active in these four scrips.
