## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The conversion of partly paid shares to fully paid shares represents completion of payment obligations by shareholders who had subscribed to the rights issue.

The number of shares (7,46,133) represents a small fraction relative to UPL's total equity base, resulting in negligible dilution impact on existing shareholders.
