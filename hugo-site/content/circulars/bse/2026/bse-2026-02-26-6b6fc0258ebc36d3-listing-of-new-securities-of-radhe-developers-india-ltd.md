## Impact Assessment

The listing of 2,51,39,620 preferential shares increases the total share capital of Radhe Developers (India) Ltd. and may result in equity dilution for existing shareholders. However, since these shares are locked in until September 29, 2027, there is no immediate increase in tradeable float. Market impact is expected to be minimal in the short term. Investors and trading members should note the expanded share capital and the lock-in restriction on the newly listed shares.
