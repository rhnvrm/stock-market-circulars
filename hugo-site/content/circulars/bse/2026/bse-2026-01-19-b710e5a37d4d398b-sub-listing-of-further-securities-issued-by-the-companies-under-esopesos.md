## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares represents a marginal increase in the outstanding share capital of these companies. Dr. Agarwal's Health Care Limited has the largest issuance with 337,504 shares, while the other companies have relatively smaller numbers. Since there is no lock-in period, these shares are immediately tradable, but the volumes are unlikely to significantly impact market liquidity or price discovery for these securities.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - This is a routine sub-listing process that exchanges and market participants handle regularly. No special operational adjustments are required beyond standard listing procedures.
