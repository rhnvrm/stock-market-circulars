## Impact Assessment

The listing of these preferentially allotted promoter shares results in a modest equity dilution for existing shareholders of JSW Energy Limited. As the shares are locked in until September 9, 2027, there is no immediate selling pressure from this allotment. The preferential issue at Rs. 525/- per share signals promoter confidence and may have been part of a fundraising initiative. Market impact is expected to be low given the lock-in constraint.
