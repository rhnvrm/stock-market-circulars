## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The preferential allotment of 13.6 million shares represents a significant equity dilution event that may impact stock price and trading volumes. The staggered lock-in periods (1 year and 2.5 years) provide some stability by preventing immediate selling pressure from allottees.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will experience dilution. The high premium (Rs. 759.16 over face value of Rs. 10) suggests confidence in the company's valuation. The distinction between promoter and non-promoter allottees with different lock-in periods indicates strategic capital raising.

**Trading Impact**: The large volume of shares becoming tradable in phases (July 2026 and July 2027) may create future liquidity events that traders should monitor.
