## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The bonus issue will increase the total issued equity capital of Orient Technologies Limited by 10% (based on 1:10 ratio). This will improve stock liquidity and make shares more accessible to retail investors through reduced per-share price.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders as of record date (January 5, 2026) will receive 1 bonus share for every 10 shares held. This is a value-neutral event that increases shareholding quantity without changing proportional ownership.

**Trading Impact**: Post-listing on January 7, 2026, the stock price will adjust proportionally to reflect the increased share count. The 1:10 ratio is relatively modest compared to more aggressive bonus ratios, minimizing price volatility.
