## Impact Assessment

This revision has moderate operational impact on trading members participating in commodity derivatives, particularly those trading internationally referenceable non-agricultural commodities.

Trading members will need to ensure adequate staffing and system availability during the extended hours. The 15-minute trade modification window (until 11:45 PM) provides necessary time for corrections.
