## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: January 2, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 5, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects 30 securities with varying levels of trading restrictions. Tighter price bands will reduce intraday volatility but may also impact liquidity for affected stocks.

**Trading Impact**: Stricter price bands limit maximum daily price movement, potentially protecting investors from excessive volatility while restricting trading flexibility. Securities with 1-2% bands (Nutricircle, Octaware, Shri Keshav Cements, Sri Chakra Cement) face the most significant trading constraints.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in these securities should be aware of reduced daily price movement limits, which may affect entry/exit strategies and order execution.
