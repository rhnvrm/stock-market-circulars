The shares were issued on a preferential basis to Non-Promoters pursuant to the conversion of warrants.

- Distribution numbers: 233339911 to 234339910
- ISIN: INE550F01049

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification under BSE's listing and trading framework for newly allotted securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the new securities available for trading from February 27, 2026
- The entire lot of 10,00,000 shares is subject to a lock-in period and cannot be freely traded until after the lock-in expiry date

- **Lock-in Expiry Date:** September 9, 2026 (for all 10,00,000 shares)

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact. The addition of 10,00,000 shares increases the total share count of Hazoor Multi Projects Limited, representing a minor dilution to existing shareholders. The full lock-in of these shares until September 9, 2026 means no immediate increase in free-float or selling pressure. The issue price of Rs. 30/- (Rs. 1/- face value + Rs. 29/- premium) provides a reference point for the preferential allotment valuation.
