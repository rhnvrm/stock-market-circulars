## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The preferential allotment represents a significant expansion of Mindspace Business Parks REIT's unit base. At Rs. 464.64 per unit, the total fundraise amounts to approximately Rs. 1,820 crores. The staggered lock-in structure (alternating between 1-year and 3-year periods across 22 tranches) minimizes immediate supply overhang.

**Unitholder Impact**: Existing unitholders will experience dilution from the new issuance. However, the sponsor lock-in demonstrates long-term commitment. The pari-passu ranking ensures equal treatment for distribution and voting rights.

**Operational Impact**: The fundraise likely supports REIT expansion plans, property acquisitions, or capital expenditure. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the expanded unit base and track lock-in restrictions across multiple tranches.
