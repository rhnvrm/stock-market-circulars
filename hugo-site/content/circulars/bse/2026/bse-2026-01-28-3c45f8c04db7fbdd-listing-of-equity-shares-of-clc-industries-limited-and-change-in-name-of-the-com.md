## Important Dates

- **January 28, 2026**: Notice date
- **January 30, 2026**: Effective date for listing and name change
- **January 12, 2024**: Record date for resolution plan implementation (as per Exchange Notice No. 20240110-44)
- **January 30, 2027**: Lock-in expiry date for 93,55,212 shares
- **May 12, 2023**: NCLT approval date for Resolution Plan

## Impact Assessment

**Existing Shareholders**: Highly adverse impact with 95% shareholding reduction. Public shareholders retain only 1 share for every 100 shares held as on record date (January 12, 2024).

**Market Impact**: Fresh listing after IBC resolution introduces new majority ownership structure. The complete extinguishment of promoter holdings and entry of Successful Resolution Applicant (holding 95% post-allotment) represents fundamental change in company control.

**Trading Impact**: Placement in T Group with Trade-to-Trade segment restricts trading flexibility, indicating higher risk profile. No intraday trading allowed, full delivery-based settlement required.

**Liquidity**: Lock-in of 93.55 lakh shares (90% of total) until January 2027 will significantly constrain free float and liquidity. Only ~10.39 lakh shares available for trading initially.

**Operational**: Company emerges from insolvency proceedings with restructured capital base and new management under Successful Resolution Applicant, requiring close monitoring of business revival efforts.
