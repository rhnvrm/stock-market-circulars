- **31 January 2026**: Record date for determining rights issue eligibility

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Moderate impact expected as the stock will trade ex-rights from 30 January 2026, which typically results in a price adjustment reflecting the rights value. Shareholders holding shares before the ex-date will be eligible for rights entitlement.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders as of record date will have the opportunity to subscribe to additional shares at Rs. 120 per share, maintaining or increasing their stake. Non-participation will result in proportional dilution. The rights ratio (1:4) indicates a 25% capital raise relative to existing shareholding.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure systems are configured to handle ex-rights trading from 30 January 2026 and properly manage client entitlements based on holdings as of the record date.
