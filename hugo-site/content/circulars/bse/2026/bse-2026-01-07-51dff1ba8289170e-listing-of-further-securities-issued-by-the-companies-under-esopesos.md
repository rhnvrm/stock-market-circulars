## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Commencement Date**: January 8, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not Applicable (NA) - no lock-in period for any securities

## Impact Assessment

The market impact is minimal as ESOP/ESOS listings are routine corporate actions. The share quantities being listed represent employee compensation and are relatively small compared to the outstanding equity of these large-cap and mid-cap companies. The absence of lock-in periods means these shares are immediately available for trading, though employee recipients may be subject to internal company policies. This listing increases market float marginally and reflects normal employee stock option exercise activity. No significant price movement or trading volume changes are expected as a result of this listing.
