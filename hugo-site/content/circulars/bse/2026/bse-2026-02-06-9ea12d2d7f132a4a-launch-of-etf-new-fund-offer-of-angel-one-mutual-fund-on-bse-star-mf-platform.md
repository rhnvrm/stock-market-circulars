## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it announces a routine NFO launch for a specific mutual fund product. The impact is limited to:

- Members participating in BSE StAR MF Platform who wish to offer this ETF to their clients
- Investors interested in silver-based ETF investment opportunities
- Operational processes for members handling NFO subscriptions with specific fund settlement timelines

The scheme provides an additional investment vehicle for silver exposure through an ETF structure, but does not affect broader market operations or existing trading activities.
