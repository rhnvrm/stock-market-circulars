  530943)'
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a new ISIN number for AQYLON NEXUS LIMITED (Scrip Code: 530943) following the sub-division of its equity shares from a face value of Rs.10/- to Re.1/- per share. This notice continues from Exchange Notice No. 20260219-10 dated February 19, 2026, and informs trading members of the new ISIN to be used effective from the ex-date.

## Key Points

- New ISIN assigned: **INE416A01051** for AQYLON NEXUS LIMITED (Scrip Code: 530943)
- Share sub-division ratio: Rs.10/- face value reduced to Re.1/- face value per equity share
- New ISIN is effective for all trades on and from the ex-date of **March 5, 2026**
- DR Reference: DR-833/2025-2026
- Continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20260219-10 dated February 19, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This notice operationalises a previously announced corporate action (share sub-division) by assigning the requisite new ISIN number as mandated under exchange listing and depository regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN **INE416A01051** for all trades in AQYLON NEXUS LIMITED equity shares on and from March 5, 2026
- Members should update their back-office and trading systems to reflect the new ISIN prior to the ex-date
- Existing holdings under the old ISIN will be converted in line with the sub-division ratio through the depository mechanism

## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Circular Issue Date | February 26, 2026 |
| Previous Notice (20260219-10) | February 19, 2026 |
| Ex-Date (new ISIN effective) | **March 5, 2026** |

## Impact Assessment

The share sub-division from Rs.10/- to Re.1/- (a 1:10 split) will increase the number of shares outstanding tenfold while proportionally reducing the face value and market price per share. The new ISIN INE416A01051 must be used for settlement of all trades from the ex-date of March 5, 2026. Trading members and custodians must ensure system readiness before the ex-date to avoid settlement failures. Retail investors holding AQYLON NEXUS shares will see their holding quantity increase by 10x with a corresponding price adjustment, but no change in overall portfolio value at the time of the split.
