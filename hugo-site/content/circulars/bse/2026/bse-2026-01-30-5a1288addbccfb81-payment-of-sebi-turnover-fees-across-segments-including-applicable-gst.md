## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Trading members across all segments (Cash, Derivatives, Currency, Commodity, Interest Rate, New Debt, Repo, and EGR) must ensure liquidity management to accommodate the fee debit. The 18% GST increases the total outflow compared to base turnover fees.

**Financial Impact**: Medium - affects all trading members proportionally based on their January 2026 trading volumes across multiple segments. Members with higher turnover will face larger debits.

**Administrative Impact**: Members need to allocate resources to verify calculations, download invoices, and reconcile debits within a tight 1-day window between information availability and debit execution.
