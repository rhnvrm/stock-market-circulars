## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Members trading in Gold and Silver commodity derivatives must maintain higher margins during the tender period, which may impact liquidity and trading positions. The continuation of these margins indicates ongoing volatility concerns in precious metals markets.

**Operational Impact**: Clearing members need to ensure adequate collateral is available to meet the additional margin requirements of 4.5% for Silver and 1% for Gold contracts. This affects capital allocation and risk management strategies for participants in commodity derivatives segment.

**Risk Management**: The measure aims to mitigate systemic risk in the commodity derivatives market, particularly for precious metals during delivery/tender periods when price volatility may be heightened.
