title: Changes to the BSE Indices - Allcargo Gati Ltd. Amalgamation
---

## Summary

BSE has announced changes to multiple BSE indices effective November 12, 2025, following the amalgamation of Allcargo Gati Ltd. (Exchange ticker: 532345) into Allcargo Logistics Ltd. (Exchange ticker: 532749). Allcargo Gati Ltd. will be removed from BSE SMALLCAP, BSE ALLCAP, BSE SERVICES, and BSE MIDSMALLCAP indices as part of the scheme of arrangement.

## Key Points

- Allcargo Gati Ltd. (532345) is being amalgamated into Allcargo Logistics Ltd. (532749)
- The amalgamation becomes effective on Wednesday, November 12, 2025
- No new stocks are being added to the affected indices, only deletions
- Changes have been included in the end-of-day corporate action file (*.SDE)
- Queries can be directed to bseindex@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an index reconstitution following a corporate action (amalgamation).

## Compliance Requirements

- Index fund managers and ETF providers tracking the affected indices must rebalance their portfolios to reflect the deletion of Allcargo Gati Ltd.
- Market participants should note the changes for portfolio management and investment strategies
- The changes are reflected in the corporate action file for automated processing

## Important Dates

- **November 7, 2025**: Announcement date
- **November 12, 2025**: Effective date for index changes and amalgamation

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The removal of Allcargo Gati Ltd. from four BSE indices will trigger rebalancing activities by passive fund managers. Index funds and ETFs tracking BSE SMALLCAP, BSE ALLCAP, BSE SERVICES, and BSE MIDSMALLCAP will need to sell their holdings in Allcargo Gati Ltd.

**Affected Indices**:
1. BSE SMALLCAP
2. BSE ALLCAP
3. BSE SERVICES
4. BSE MIDSMALLCAP

**Investor Considerations**: Investors holding index funds or ETFs based on these indices should be aware of the rebalancing. The amalgamation suggests that Allcargo Logistics Ltd. may see increased weight or presence in relevant indices, though this is not explicitly stated in the circular.
