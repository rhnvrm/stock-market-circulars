## Regulatory Framework

**ST-ASM Framework Purpose:**
The Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure is applied to securities exhibiting unusual price movements or trading patterns over short periods (5/15/30 days) to protect investors and maintain market integrity.

**Stage System:**
- Securities can be placed in different stages (I, II, III, etc.) based on severity
- Higher stages typically involve stricter surveillance and trading restrictions
- Securities can move between stages or exit to other frameworks

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 31, 2025
- All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Investors holding the 4 newly added securities will face enhanced surveillance measures including potential additional margin requirements
- Securities exiting ST-ASM may see improved liquidity if moving to less restrictive frameworks, or continued restrictions if moving to LT-ASM or ESM
- KBS India Ltd investors should prepare for stricter surveillance as it moves to a higher stage

**Investor Implications:**
- Enhanced scrutiny on new ST-ASM securities may affect trading volumes and volatility
- SME investors particularly affected with 3 out of 4 new additions being SME scrips
- Securities moving to ESM or LT-ASM frameworks will be subject to different surveillance criteria

**Compliance Requirements:**
- Trading members must ensure systems are updated to reflect new ST-ASM classifications
- Appropriate margin requirements and surveillance parameters must be applied from October 31, 2025
