title: Change in Minimum Application Amount of Aditya Birla Sun Life Overnight Fund
  on BSE StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited has announced a reduction in the minimum application amount for the Growth Option of Aditya Birla Sun Life Overnight Fund. The minimum investment requirement has been lowered from Rs. 500 to Rs. 100, with multiples of Re. 1 thereafter, effective December 4, 2025. This change is documented as Addendum No. 52/2025 to the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM).

## Key Points

- Minimum application amount for Growth Option reduced from Rs. 500 to Rs. 100
- Investment multiples remain at Re. 1 thereafter
- Change effective from Thursday, December 4, 2025
- Documented as Addendum No. 52/2025
- All other terms and conditions of the SID and KIM remain unchanged
- Applies to Aditya Birla Sun Life Overnight Fund on BSE StAR MF platform

## Regulatory Changes

This is a scheme-level modification rather than a regulatory change. The Investment Manager has revised the minimum application parameters within the existing regulatory framework. The change will be incorporated into the Scheme Information Document and Key Information Memorandum through the official addendum process.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors can now subscribe to the Growth Option with a minimum of Rs. 100 instead of Rs. 500
- Additional purchases continue in multiples of Re. 1
- The addendum forms an integral part of the SID and KIM and must be read in conjunction with existing scheme documents
- All investors should read scheme-related documents carefully along with this addendum

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 3, 2025
- **Effective Date**: Thursday, December 4, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is an administrative change affecting a single mutual fund scheme.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for retail investors. The reduced minimum application amount (80% reduction from Rs. 500 to Rs. 100) lowers the entry barrier for small investors seeking to invest in overnight funds, potentially increasing accessibility to this liquid fund category.

**Operational Impact**: Limited to BSE StAR MF platform operations for processing investments in this specific scheme. No impact on broader market operations or other mutual fund schemes.
