title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities List Update
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework effective December 16, 2025. Four new securities are being added to ESM, one security is moving to a higher ESM stage, and no securities are exiting the framework. The circular includes a consolidated list of 28+ securities currently under ESM across different stages.

## Key Points

- 4 new securities shortlisted for ESM Framework: Brijlaxmi Leasing & Finance Ltd (532113), Ishaan Infrastructures and Shelters Ltd (540134), Rapicut Carbides Ltd (500360), and Shentracon Chemicals Ltd (530757)
- Transchem Ltd (500422) will move to a higher ESM stage
- No securities are moving to lower ESM stages
- No securities are exiting the ESM Framework
- Consolidated list includes securities at ESM Stage I and Stage II
- Changes effective from December 16, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM Framework continues to apply progressive surveillance measures on securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or high volatility. Securities in ESM are subject to:
- Trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday trading)
- 100% margin requirements
- Additional disclosure obligations
- Progressive stage-wise restrictions

Securities marked with special indicators:
- (*) As per NSE coordination
- (#) SME Scrip
- ($) Moving to SMP Framework
- (@) Moving to IBC Framework
- (^) As per Parent Company
- (~) Will continue in Trade for Trade as per circular dated November 27, 2025

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure 100% upfront margin collection for ESM securities
- All trades in ESM securities will be settled on a trade-for-trade basis with compulsory delivery
- No intraday trading or carry forward positions allowed
- Enhanced reporting and monitoring requirements for brokers
- Investors should be made aware of the ESM status before trading

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 16, 2025 - All ESM changes become applicable
- **Circular Date**: December 15, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 4 securities to ESM and upward stage movement of 1 security will reduce liquidity and trading flexibility in these counters. Trade-for-trade settlement requirements discourage speculative activity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their risk management systems to apply appropriate margin and settlement controls for newly added ESM securities. Price discovery may be affected due to reduced participation.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities face increased transaction costs, mandatory delivery obligations, and reduced liquidity. The ESM framework serves as a cautionary signal about abnormal price movements or volatility in these securities.

## Annexure Details

**Annexure I - Part A**: New ESM additions and stage changes
**Annexure II - Part A**: Securities exiting ESM (NIL in this update)
**Annexure III**: Consolidated list showing 28+ securities under ESM Stage I and Stage II, including AAA Technologies Ltd, ABM Knowledgeware Ltd, Abram Food Ltd, Adcon Capital Services Ltd, and others.
