## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The preferential issue represents approximately 9% dilution based on typical Tega Industries equity base. However, immediate trading impact is minimal as all shares are under lock-in for at least 1.5 years.

**Trading Impact**: Negligible short-term impact as locked-in shares cannot be traded until respective expiry dates.

**Liquidity Impact**: No immediate change to free float as shares are locked in. Liquidity will increase post lock-in expiry in July 2026 and July 2027.
