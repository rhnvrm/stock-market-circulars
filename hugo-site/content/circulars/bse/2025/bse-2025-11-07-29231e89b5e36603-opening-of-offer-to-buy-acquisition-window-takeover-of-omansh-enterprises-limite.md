## Regulatory Changes

This offer is made pursuant to SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011. While Regulation 7 requires offer size of at least 26% of expanded voting share capital, this offer is restricted to 44,03,007 equity shares (25.12%) as it represents shares held by public shareholders excluding selling public shareholders.

## Compliance Requirements

- **For Public Shareholders**: Eligible shareholders must review the Letter of Offer and accompanying Form of Acceptance cum Acknowledgment
- **For Recent Sellers**: Those who have sold shares should hand over the Letter of Offer and Form of Acceptance to the stock exchange member through whom the sale was effected
- **Statutory Approvals**: As per Para 7.17 of the Letter of Offer, statutory and other approvals are required as specified; if additional approvals become necessary before closure of Tendering Period, the offer will be subject to such approvals
- **Price Revision**: Any upward revision in offer price will be communicated

- **Tendering Period**: To be specified in detailed public announcement (dates not provided in this excerpt)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - This is a significant corporate action involving change of control of Omansh Enterprises Limited. The open offer for 25.12% stake will affect public shareholders' holdings and may impact stock liquidity and price.

**Shareholder Impact**: High - Public shareholders (excluding selling shareholders) have the opportunity to tender their shares at INR 2 per share. This provides an exit opportunity at the specified price.

**Operational Impact**: High - The acquisition signals change in control and potential strategic direction for the target company. Four acquirers acting in concert are seeking to consolidate control through this regulatory mechanism.

**Regulatory Impact**: This transaction follows mandatory open offer requirements under SEBI (SAST) Regulations for control acquisition, ensuring fair treatment of minority shareholders.
