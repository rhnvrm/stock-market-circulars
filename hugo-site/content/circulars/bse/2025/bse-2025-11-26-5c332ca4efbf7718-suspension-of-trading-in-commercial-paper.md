## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market-wide impact as it pertains to routine redemptions of commercial paper instruments. The temporary trading suspensions are standard procedures when companies redeem their short-term debt securities. Investors holding these instruments should be aware of the upcoming redemptions. The suspensions affect the debt market segment only and involve well-known financial services companies and large corporates. No unusual market disruption is expected as these are planned corporate actions.
