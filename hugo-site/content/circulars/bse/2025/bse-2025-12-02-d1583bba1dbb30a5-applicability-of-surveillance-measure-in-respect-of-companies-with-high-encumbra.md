## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Securities under high encumbrance surveillance face increased scrutiny and may experience reduced liquidity as investors become cautious. The presence of high promoter encumbrance indicates potential financial stress and increased risk of margin calls or forced selling.

**Investor Impact**: High - Investors holding these securities should be aware of elevated risks. High encumbrance levels suggest promoters have pledged substantial portions of their holdings, which could lead to volatility if lenders invoke pledges.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading in these securities continues but under enhanced surveillance. Trading members and market participants need to account for the surveillance status in their risk management frameworks.

**Risk Factors**: Companies with high promoter encumbrance are at greater risk during market downturns, as falling stock prices may trigger margin calls leading to forced selling and further price declines. The surveillance measure serves as an early warning system for market participants.
