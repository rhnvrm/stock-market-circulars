This circular has minimal market impact as it is a routine settlement schedule for the SLB reverse leg segment. It affects only market participants engaged in securities lending and borrowing activities. The schedule provides operational clarity for the upcoming quarter, enabling members to plan their settlement obligations. No changes to existing procedures or timelines are introduced. The tight 10-minute window between instruction submission deadline (08:50 a.m.) and pay-in time (09:00 a.m.) requires members to ensure prompt processing of settlement instructions.
