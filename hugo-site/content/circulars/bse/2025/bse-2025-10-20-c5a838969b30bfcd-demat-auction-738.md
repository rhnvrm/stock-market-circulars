## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 118 different securities with varying quantities. While this is a routine operational matter, it indicates delivery failures across multiple trades.

**Trading Impact:** Members with delivery obligations in these securities will need to participate in the auction, potentially at unfavorable prices, impacting their transaction costs.

**Investor Impact:** Investors who were expecting delivery of these securities may face delays until the auction settlement is completed. The large quantity of WELCURE DRUG (54,730 shares) in particular suggests significant delivery shortfall in that scrip.

**Operational Impact:** Standard demat auction process ensures market integrity by providing a mechanism to complete failed deliveries, maintaining confidence in the settlement system.
