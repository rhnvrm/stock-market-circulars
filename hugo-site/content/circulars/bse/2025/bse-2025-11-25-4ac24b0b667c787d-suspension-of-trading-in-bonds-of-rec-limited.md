## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of REC LIMITED's 5.85% bonds (ISIN: INE020B08DF6). This is a scheduled redemption event and represents normal corporate action. Bondholders on record as of December 5, 2025 will be eligible for redemption proceeds. The suspension prevents any further trading activity in these bonds, protecting investors from purchasing securities that are being redeemed. No broader market impact is anticipated as this affects only a single debt instrument.
