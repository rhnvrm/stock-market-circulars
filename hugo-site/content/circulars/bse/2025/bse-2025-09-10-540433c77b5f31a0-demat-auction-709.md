## Impact Assessment

This demat auction primarily affects shareholders who have failed to deliver securities in previous transactions. The auction allows market participants to acquire these securities to complete their settlement obligations. The presence of blue-chip stocks in small quantities suggests routine settlement issues rather than systemic problems. The larger quantities in smaller companies may indicate delivery challenges specific to those securities.
