## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The addition of Shalimar Paints to the high encumbrance framework signals regulatory concern about the level of pledged shares in the company. This may lead to:
- Increased scrutiny from investors and analysts
- Potential impact on stock liquidity
- Enhanced monitoring by exchange and regulatory authorities

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or considering positions in Shalimar Paints should be aware of the elevated encumbrance levels. High promoter and non-promoter pledging can indicate financial stress and increased risk in adverse market conditions.

**Compliance Impact:** Companies under this framework face stricter monitoring and disclosure obligations regarding any changes in encumbrance levels of their securities.
