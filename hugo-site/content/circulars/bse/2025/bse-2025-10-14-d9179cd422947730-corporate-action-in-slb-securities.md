## Impact Assessment

**Market Operations Impact:** Medium - SLB participants must plan position management around shut periods. The staggered dates across October-November reduce concentrated market impact.

**Liquidity Impact:** Low to Medium - Temporary restriction on SLB availability may affect short-selling strategies and securities lending revenue during shut periods, though short duration limits impact.

**Investor Impact:** High-profile companies including TCS, HCL Technologies, and CRISIL are included, affecting institutional investors and arbitrage strategies that rely on SLB mechanisms.

**Operational Impact:** Market participants must monitor multiple dates across different securities to ensure compliance with shut period restrictions and avoid potential penalties or forced closeouts.
