**Investor Impact:** Medium. Investors holding these securities need to ensure their holdings are settled by the respective record dates to receive dividends, interest, or redemption proceeds. The bulletin provides advance notice for portfolio planning.

**Operational Impact:** Low. Standard corporate action processing for market participants. Intermediaries must update systems and communicate with clients regarding entitlements based on record date holdings.
