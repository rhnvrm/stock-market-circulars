---

## Summary

BSE has announced changes to securities under the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective November 6, 2025. One new security (Shree Salasar Investments Ltd) has been added to ESM. Three securities (BGIL Films & Technologies Ltd, Esha Media Research Ltd, and Tamilnadu Steel Tubes Ltd) are being moved to higher ESM stages. No securities are moving to lower stages or exiting the ESM framework. A consolidated list shows at least 28 securities currently under ESM surveillance across different stages.

## Key Points

- 1 new security shortlisted for ESM framework: Shree Salasar Investments Ltd (Scrip Code: 503635, ISIN: INE315N01017)
- 3 securities moving to higher ESM stages: BGIL Films & Technologies Ltd, Esha Media Research Ltd, Tamilnadu Steel Tubes Ltd
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages
- No securities exiting ESM framework in this update
- Consolidated list includes securities in ESM Stage I and Stage II
- Changes effective from November 6, 2025
- ESM framework applies progressive trading restrictions based on stage level

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework continues BSE's progressive surveillance approach for securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or other concerns. Securities are classified into different stages (Stage I, Stage II, etc.) with escalating restrictions. Movement to higher stages indicates continued surveillance concerns, while new additions indicate fresh identification of securities requiring enhanced monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors and brokers must be aware of ESM securities and applicable trading restrictions
- Securities under ESM typically face additional margin requirements, trade-to-trade settlement, and price bands
- Higher ESM stages involve progressively stricter surveillance measures
- Market participants should review the consolidated list of 28+ securities under ESM
- Trading in ESM securities requires compliance with specific surveillance conditions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 6, 2025 - All ESM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - ESM designation significantly affects liquidity and trading patterns. Securities under ESM face restricted trading conditions that typically reduce investor participation and increase transaction costs.

**Investor Impact**: High - Investors holding or trading these securities will face:
- Reduced liquidity due to trade-to-trade settlement
- Higher margin requirements
- Potential difficulty in position unwinding
- Increased price volatility due to restricted trading

**Operational Impact**: Movement to higher ESM stages for 3 securities indicates persistent concerns requiring stricter surveillance. New addition of Shree Salasar Investments suggests fresh surveillance triggers. The absence of securities exiting ESM indicates ongoing market concerns for previously flagged securities.
