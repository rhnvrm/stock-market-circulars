## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The preferential allotment represents a relatively modest increase in share capital. The staggered lock-in periods (until June 2026 and May 2027) will limit immediate liquidity impact.

**Shareholding Impact**: The allotment includes both promoter and non-promoter categories, with the majority (6,95,893 shares) having a shorter lock-in period ending June 2026.

**Trading Impact**: Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and applicable lock-in restrictions for the new distribution numbers.
