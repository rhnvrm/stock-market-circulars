title: Trading and Settlement Programme for Mutual Fund Segment - January 2026
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the trading and settlement programme for its Mutual Fund segment for January 2026 (01.01.2026 to 31.01.2026). The circular details settlement numbers, dates, and fund/unit payout schedules for three categories: MF Subscription (excluding Liquid), MF Subscription (Liquid), and MF Redemption transactions.

## Key Points

- Settlement schedule covers 21 settlement cycles from January 1-30, 2026 (SETM_NO 2526187 to 2526207)
- For non-liquid subscriptions: T+1 settlement cycle (units payout next business day)
- For liquid subscriptions: T+0 settlement cycle (same day settlement)
- Funds payout to AMCs for non-liquid transactions occurs before 3:00 PM on T day
- NFO (New Fund Offer) scheme payouts depend on funds confirmation received by ICCL till 6:00 PM on T day
- Redemption units payin occurs on transaction date (T+0)
- Redemption funds payout follows scheme-specific TAT (ranging from T+1 to T+10 days)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard operational schedule.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must follow the specified settlement timelines for mutual fund transactions
- Investors should verify scheme-specific redemption TAT in the scheme master available on BSE Star MF Platform
- AMCs must be prepared to receive funds payouts at designated times

## Important Dates

- **Applicable Period**: January 1-31, 2026
- **First Settlement**: January 1, 2026 (SETM_NO 2526187)
- **Last Settlement**: January 30, 2026 (SETM_NO 2526207)
- **Non-Liquid Funds Payout**: Before 3:00 PM on T day
- **NFO Funds Confirmation Deadline**: 6:00 PM on T day

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine monthly operational schedule that ensures smooth functioning of the mutual fund segment on BSE.

**Operational Impact**: Medium for mutual fund intermediaries and AMCs who must align their internal processes with these settlement schedules. Investors benefit from clarity on when their transactions will be processed.

**Timeline Considerations**: The schedule accounts for weekends and holidays, with gaps visible on January 3-4, 10-11, 17-18, 24-26, and 31 (likely non-trading days). Market participants should note the redemption payout timing varies by scheme type (T+1 through T+10), requiring investors to check individual scheme masters for specific TAT details.
