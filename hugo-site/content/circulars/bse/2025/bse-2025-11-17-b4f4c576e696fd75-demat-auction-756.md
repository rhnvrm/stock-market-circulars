## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 94 scrips across various market capitalizations and sectors. While routine in nature, the large quantity in some scrips (particularly Murae Organics with 300,000 shares) could have localized price impact.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading members with short positions in these scrips must arrange for funds and participate in the auction. The auction ensures smooth settlement and maintains market integrity by addressing delivery failures.

**Liquidity Impact:** The auction may temporarily affect liquidity in the affected scrips, particularly for low-volume stocks where even small auction quantities represent significant percentage of daily trading volumes.
