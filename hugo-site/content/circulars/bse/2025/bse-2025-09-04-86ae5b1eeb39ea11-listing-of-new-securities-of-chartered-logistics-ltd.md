- **Allotment Date**: December 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The listing represents a significant dilution of approximately 26.8% (assuming previous share capital). The preferential allotment to non-promoters may alter the company's shareholding pattern and improve public float. The 18-month lock-in period provides stability but limits immediate liquidity of these shares.
