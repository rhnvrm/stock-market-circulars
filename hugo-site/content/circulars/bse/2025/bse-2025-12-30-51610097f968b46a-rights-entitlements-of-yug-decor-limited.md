No regulatory framework changes. This circular implements existing rights issue procedures for a specific company.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Inform all clients about commencement of trading in REs
- Clearly mention the ISIN of the RE (INE796W20027)
- Ensure clients do not mistake REs for ordinary shares
- Include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills containing purchase of REs
- Disclaimer must inform clients that:
  - Purchase of REs only gives right to participate in ongoing Rights Issue by making application with requisite money OR renounce the REs before issue closes
  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced before Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished
- Refer to previous notices: 20200305-21 (March 05, 2020) and 20200518-34 (May 18, 2020) for additional details

## Important Dates

- **December 30, 2025**: Notice date
- **January 02, 2026**: REs trading commences; Rights Issue opens
- **January 20, 2026**: REs trading for renunciation ends
- **January 23, 2026**: Rights Issue closes

## Impact Assessment

**Impact Level**: Medium - Company-specific

**Affected Parties**:
- Existing shareholders of YUG DECOR LIMITED who receive rights entitlements
- Trading members facilitating RE transactions
- Investors interested in participating in the rights issue

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update systems to handle RE trading under the specified scrip code and ISIN, ensure proper client communication protocols, and include mandatory disclaimers in contract notes. The 3-week renunciation window provides sufficient time for shareholders to decide on participation or renunciation.

**Market Impact**: Limited to YUG DECOR LIMITED and its stakeholders. The tradable nature of REs allows shareholders who do not wish to participate to monetize their entitlements through market sales.
