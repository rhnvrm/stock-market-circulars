## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of approximately 3.98 crore new shares represents a significant dilution event for existing shareholders. At the issue price of Rs. 201.12, the QIP has raised approximately Rs. 800 crores (3,97,77,247 × Rs. 201.12), indicating substantial capital infusion into the company.

**Shareholding Impact**: Existing shareholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage, though the exact dilution percentage depends on the pre-QIP share capital. The allotment to QIBs (institutional investors) may improve the institutional holding profile of the company.

**Trading Impact**: Increased float and liquidity in the stock from November 13, 2025. The market will need to absorb the additional supply, which could create short-term price pressure depending on demand conditions.

**Operational Impact**: The capital raised through QIP will likely be used for business expansion, debt reduction, or working capital requirements, which could positively impact the company's long-term operational capacity and financial health.
