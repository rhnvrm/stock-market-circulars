## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard operational procedure for securities approaching maturity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the listed T-bills and Sovereign Gold Bond from December 9, 2025
- Members should update their systems to reflect the trading suspension
- No new positions should be created in these securities

## Important Dates

- **December 8, 2025**: Circular issued
- **December 9, 2025**: Trading suspension becomes effective
- **December 11, 2025**: Redemption date for all listed securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to debt segment participants holding or trading these specific T-bills and the Sovereign Gold Bond. The impact is routine and expected as securities approach maturity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure compliance by removing these securities from tradable lists. Investors holding these instruments will receive redemption proceeds on the maturity date. The suspension prevents last-minute trading activity that could complicate settlement at redemption.
