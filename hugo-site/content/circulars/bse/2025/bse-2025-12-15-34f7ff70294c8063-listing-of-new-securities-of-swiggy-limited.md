**Market Impact**: High - This is a substantial QIP raising approximately Rs. 10,000 crores, representing a significant equity dilution event for Swiggy. The large number of shares (over 2.66 billion) will increase the company's equity base substantially.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will experience dilution as the QIP increases the total share count. The issue price of Rs. 375 per share will serve as a reference point for market valuation.

**Liquidity Impact**: The addition of 2.66 billion shares to the traded float is expected to significantly enhance liquidity in Swiggy's stock.

**Investor Sentiment**: QIP to institutional investors typically signals confidence from qualified buyers and may be viewed positively, though the dilution effect needs to be monitored.
