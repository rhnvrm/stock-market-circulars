## Impact Assessment

This partial redemption impacts holders of these specific PTC series by returning capital while reducing the outstanding face value. Trading members must ensure their systems accurately reflect the new face values to prevent pricing errors. The impact is limited to these six specific debt instruments and does not affect broader market operations. Investors holding these PTCs will see reduced principal amounts but have received partial redemption proceeds.
