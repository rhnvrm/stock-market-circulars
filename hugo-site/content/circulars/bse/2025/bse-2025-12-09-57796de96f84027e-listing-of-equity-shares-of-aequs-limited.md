**Market Liquidity**: Approximately 31% of total shares (20,37,22,458 shares) are not under lock-in and immediately tradable, providing reasonable liquidity. The remaining 69% are locked for varying periods.

**Promoter Holdings**: Significant promoter shares (53,80,88,318 shares, approximately 80% of total) are locked for periods ranging from 6 months to 3 years, ensuring promoter commitment and reducing immediate supply pressure.

**Investor Confidence**: Staggered lock-in expiry dates (from January 2026 to December 2028) prevent sudden supply shocks and support price stability.

**ESOP Impact**: 1,96,58,826 shares related to ESOP (employee holdings plus ESOP Trust) are not locked, providing flexibility for employee stock option programs.

**Trading Implications**: Investors should be aware that substantial share releases will occur at lock-in expiry dates, potentially affecting stock price and trading volumes on those dates.
