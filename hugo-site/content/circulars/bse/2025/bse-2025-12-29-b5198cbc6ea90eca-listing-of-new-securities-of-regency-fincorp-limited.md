## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notice with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment increases Regency Fincorp's outstanding equity base by 40.86 lakh shares. The lock-in periods (ranging from 18 to 32 months) ensure that the majority of shares cannot be immediately traded, limiting short-term supply pressure. The shares rank pari-passu with existing equity, maintaining equal rights for all shareholders.
