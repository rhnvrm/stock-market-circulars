---

## Summary

BSE has announced that the BSE StAR MF (Mutual Fund) platform will operate from its Disaster Recovery (DR) site on Saturday, December 13, 2025, between 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM. Members will experience platform unavailability during environment switch activities.

## Key Points

- DR site operations scheduled for Saturday, December 13, 2025, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM
- Platform access unavailable during two switch windows totaling approximately 2 hours
- Primary to DR environment switch: 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM
- DR to Primary environment switch: 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM
- Members advised to plan activities accordingly

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a scheduled operational maintenance activity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must plan their mutual fund trading and operational activities around the specified downtime windows
- Members should avoid critical operations during the switch periods
- Contact helpdesk for queries: 022-45720450/650 & 022-69158550 (8:00 AM to 7:00 PM on business days)
- Alternative support available through CRS portal: https://bsecrs.bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **December 13, 2025**: DR site operations day
- **8:30 AM - 9:30 AM**: Primary to DR environment switch (platform unavailable)
- **9:00 AM - 11:00 AM**: DR site operations window
- **11:30 AM - 12:30 PM**: DR to Primary environment switch (platform unavailable)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - The scheduled DR site operation will cause temporary platform unavailability during specific time windows on a Saturday. Since this occurs on a weekend, the impact on regular trading activities is minimized. However, members conducting mutual fund operations on Saturday will need to plan around the 4-hour total window (including both switch periods). This is a routine disaster recovery drill to ensure business continuity preparedness.
