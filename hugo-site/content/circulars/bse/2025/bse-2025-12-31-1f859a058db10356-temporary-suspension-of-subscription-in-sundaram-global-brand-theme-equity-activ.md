## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Investors seeking fresh exposure to global brand themes through this fund will need to explore alternative schemes. Existing investors with running SIPs can continue their systematic investments, and redemption facilities remain fully operational.

**Market Impact**: Limited, as this affects a single fund of fund scheme focused on overseas investments. The measure is precautionary to maintain regulatory compliance.

**Operational Impact**: The fund house must update systems to block new subscriptions while allowing existing systematic plans and redemptions to continue seamlessly. Investor communication and query handling will be critical during the suspension period.
