## Summary

BSE has announced revisions to price bands for 15 securities effective November 26, 2025. The changes range from 2% to 20% bands, with Tata Motors Ltd and Allcargo Logistics Ltd receiving the widest 20% bands. Most securities receive tighter bands between 2-10%, indicating varying levels of surveillance and volatility control measures.

## Regulatory Changes

The price band revisions are surveillance measures implemented by BSE to control volatility and protect investors. Tighter price bands (2-5%) restrict daily price movement, while wider bands (20%) allow greater price discovery. These changes reflect BSE's assessment of volatility risk and market conditions for each security.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands in their systems before market opening on November 26, 2025
- All orders must comply with the new price band limits
- Members should communicate changes to clients trading in affected securities
- Any clarifications required should be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 25, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 26, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The revised price bands will directly affect intraday trading limits for all 15 securities. Tighter bands (2-5%) will significantly restrict price movement for 10 securities, potentially reducing liquidity and making it harder for large orders to execute. The 20% band for Tata Motors suggests normal trading conditions.

**Market Participants**: Day traders and algorithmic traders will need to adjust strategies for securities with tighter bands. Investors in smaller companies (those with 2-5% bands) may experience reduced liquidity and slower price discovery.

**Surveillance Context**: The varying band widths suggest differentiated surveillance concerns - tighter bands typically indicate heightened volatility concerns, unusual price movements, or market integrity issues requiring closer monitoring.
