## Summary

BSE issued surveillance queries to three companies - Vijaya Diagnostic Centre Limited (Scrip: 543350), Banco Products (India) Limited, and Laxmi Dental Limited (Scrip: 544339) - regarding unusual increases in trading volume. All three companies responded that they have made all required disclosures under SEBI LODR 2015, have no undisclosed material information, and believe the volume increases are purely market-driven.

## Key Points

- Vijaya Diagnostic Centre Limited clarified there is no withheld information or impending announcement that could impact price or volume
- Banco Products (India) Limited stated management has no connection with the volume increase and considers it market-driven
- Laxmi Dental Limited received queries from both NSE (December 04, 2025) and BSE (December 05, 2025) regarding the volume spike
- All companies confirmed compliance with Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015
- Companies stated all price-sensitive information has been disclosed promptly

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a routine surveillance action under existing SEBI LODR framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must respond to BSE surveillance queries regarding unusual trading activity
- Companies must confirm whether they have undisclosed material information that could explain volume/price movements
- Companies must verify compliance with Regulation 30 disclosure requirements
- Responses must be submitted to BSE Surveillance Department for record

## Important Dates

- December 04, 2025: NSE sent query to Laxmi Dental Limited at 6:12 PM
- December 05, 2025: BSE sent surveillance queries to all three companies
- December 05, 2025: All three companies submitted their clarification responses

Minimal market impact. These are standard surveillance clarifications confirming no undisclosed material events. The volume increases appear to be normal market activity without fundamental triggers. No regulatory action or trading restrictions imposed. Investors can continue normal trading with awareness that exchange surveillance systems are monitoring unusual activity patterns.
