---

## Summary

BSE has assigned a new ISIN number INE060D01028 to Narmada Macplast Drip Irrigation Systems Ltd (Scrip Code: 517431) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value Rs.10/- to Rs.2/-. This is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251009-60 dated October 09, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN: INE060D01028 for equity shares of Rs.2/- each
- Previous face value: Rs.10/- per share
- New face value: Rs.2/- per share (5:1 sub-division ratio)
- Company: NARMADA MACPLAST DRIP IRRIGATION SYSTEMS LTD
- Scrip Code: 517431
- Ex-Date: October 17, 2025
- Document Reference: DR-738/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action involving share sub-division where the face value of equity shares is reduced from Rs.10/- to Rs.2/-, requiring a new ISIN for identification and settlement purposes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must note the new ISIN INE060D01028 for all trades from the ex-date
- All trading and settlement systems must be updated to reflect the new ISIN
- Brokers should inform clients holding shares about the ISIN change
- Demat accounts will reflect the new ISIN post ex-date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 15, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: October 17, 2025 - New ISIN becomes effective for all trades from this date
- **Prior Notice Reference**: October 09, 2025 (Notice No. 20251009-60)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division increases the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the price per share proportionally, making shares more affordable for retail investors. Trading will continue seamlessly under the new ISIN from the ex-date.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and custodians need to update their systems to recognize the new ISIN. Existing shareholders will see their holdings adjusted automatically in demat accounts with the new face value and ISIN. No action is required from shareholders as the sub-division is processed automatically by depositories.
