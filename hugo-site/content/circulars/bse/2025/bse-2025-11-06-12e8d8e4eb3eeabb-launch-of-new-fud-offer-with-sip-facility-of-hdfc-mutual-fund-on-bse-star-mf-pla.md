## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a new fund offering that provides investors with an additional investment option in the equity index fund category. It does not affect existing securities or market operations.

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium - BSE StAR MF Platform members need to be aware of specific timelines for fund collection, payment processing, and SIP registration authentication. The strict deadlines for fund availability (6:00 PM on allotment date) and transaction cancellation rules (9:00 AM T+1) require operational attention but follow standard NFO procedures.

**Investor Impact**: Low - Investors interested in sector-based index investing gain access to a new fund option tracking BSE India Sector Leaders Index with both regular and direct plan options.
