## Summary

BSE has issued an update regarding Investment Companies (ICs) and Investment Holding Companies (IHCs) eligible for Special Call-Auctions. Two companies will be transferred from the trade-for-trade segment to their respective groups on specified dates, while two other scrips will continue trading in the trade-for-trade segment with call auction until further notice.

## Key Points

- Kama Holdings Limited (Scrip Code: 532468) will move to Group A effective November 19, 2025
- Elcid Investments Limited (Scrip Code: 503681) will move to Group B effective November 25, 2025
- Haryana Capfin Limited (Scrip Code: 532855, Group XT) and Easy Fincorp Limited (Scrip Code: 511074, Group Z) will continue in Trade for Trade segment with call auction
- This circular continues previous notices dated November 6, November 3, and October 15, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The exchange is implementing a phased transition of Investment Companies and Investment Holding Companies from the trade-for-trade segment to their respective trading groups. This change allows for normal trading mechanisms instead of the more restrictive T2T framework for eligible companies.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the effective dates for group changes: November 19, 2025 for Kama Holdings and November 25, 2025 for Elcid Investments
- Trading members should continue to follow T2T segment rules with call auction for Haryana Capfin Limited and Easy Fincorp Limited until further notification
- Members should contact Mr. Shyam Bhagirath (022-22728013) for any clarifications

## Important Dates

- **November 19, 2025**: Kama Holdings Limited transfers to Group A
- **November 25, 2025**: Elcid Investments Limited transfers to Group B
- **Until further notice**: Haryana Capfin Limited and Easy Fincorp Limited continue in T2T with call auction

## Impact Assessment

The transfer of companies from T2T to regular trading groups is expected to improve liquidity and ease of trading for Kama Holdings and Elcid Investments. Investors in these scrips will benefit from normal trading mechanisms. However, Haryana Capfin and Easy Fincorp will remain subject to stricter T2T rules, indicating continued surveillance concerns. The impact is moderate and specific to investors and traders of these four companies.
