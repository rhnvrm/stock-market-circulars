## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital of the listed companies
- Trading members to note the new distinctive numbers range for each company
- No special trading restrictions or compliance obligations imposed

- **Notice Date**: December 18, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: December 19, 2025 (Friday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (NA for all securities)

## Impact Assessment

The market impact is minimal as ESOP/ESOS issuances represent a small percentage increase in the outstanding equity capital of these established companies. The listings are part of routine employee compensation programs and do not indicate any fundamental changes to business operations. The absence of lock-in periods suggests these shares can be traded freely from the listing date, though the relatively small volumes are unlikely to create significant price movements. This is a standard corporate action with no material impact on trading dynamics or liquidity for the listed securities.
