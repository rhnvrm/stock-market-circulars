## Summary

BSE has announced the commencement of trading in Rights Entitlements (REs) for TIMES GREEN ENERGY (INDIA) LIMITED. The REs will be available for renunciation trading from November 07, 2025 to November 12, 2025. The underlying Rights Issue opens on November 07, 2025 and closes on November 17, 2025. REs are tradable in dematerialized form only and will be settled on T+1 rolling settlement basis with trade-for-trade settlement.

## Key Points

- Scrip Code: 751054, Scrip ID: TIMES-RE, ISIN: INE0B6120012
- Market Lot: 1, Group: R
- REs tradable only in demat form
- T+1 rolling settlement with trade-for-trade basis
- REs not subscribed or renounced before issue closing date will lapse and be extinguished
- Trading members must include disclaimer in contract notes informing clients that RE purchase only provides right to participate in Rights Issue
- Reference notices: 20200305-21 (March 05, 2020) and 20200518-34 (May 18, 2020)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular follows existing BSE framework for Rights Entitlements trading as established in previous notices from 2020.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform all clients about commencement of RE trading with correct ISIN
- Trading members must clarify that REs are not ordinary shares of the company
- Contract notes/bills for RE purchases must prominently include disclaimer explaining:
  - Purchase only grants right to participate in Rights Issue with requisite application money
  - REs can be renounced before issue closes
  - Unsubscribed/unrenounced REs will lapse after issue closing date
- Trading members must ensure REs are traded only in dematerialized form

## Important Dates

- **November 06, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 07, 2025**: Trading in REs for renunciation commences; Rights Issue opens
- **November 12, 2025**: Last day for RE renunciation trading
- **November 17, 2025**: Rights Issue closes; unexercised REs will lapse and be extinguished after this date
- **Settlement**: T+1 rolling settlement basis

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to shareholders and prospective investors of TIMES GREEN ENERGY (INDIA) LIMITED. The 6-day trading window for renunciation provides adequate opportunity for rights holders to monetize or transfer their entitlements.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure proper client communication and contract note disclosures. The trade-for-trade settlement on T+1 basis requires specific operational handling distinct from regular equity trading.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders receive tradable rights entitlements. Investors purchasing REs must understand they acquire only the right to subscribe to the Rights Issue, not equity shares. Failure to exercise or renounce REs before November 17, 2025 will result in permanent loss of entitlements.
