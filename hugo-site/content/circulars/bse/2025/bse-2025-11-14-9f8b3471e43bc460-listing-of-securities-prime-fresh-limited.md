## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment involves a small number of shares (12,805) issued to promoters through warrant conversion. The 18-month lock-in period ensures these shares will not enter the market immediately, preventing any dilution pressure. As the shares rank pari-passu with existing shares, there are no differential rights or complications for existing shareholders. The trading commencement is primarily an administrative formality for record-keeping purposes.
