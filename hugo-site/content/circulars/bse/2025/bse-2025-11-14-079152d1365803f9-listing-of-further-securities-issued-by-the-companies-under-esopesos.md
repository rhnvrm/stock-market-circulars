## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The allotment volume of 4,313 shares is relatively small and will not affect market liquidity or trading patterns. The lock-in periods further reduce any immediate market impact.

**Shareholder Impact**: These shares will increase the total issued share capital marginally. Existing shareholders may experience minimal dilution, depending on the total outstanding shares of the company.

**Operational Impact**: This is a routine corporate action with no operational changes required for market participants. The shares will become tradeable only after the respective lock-in periods expire.
