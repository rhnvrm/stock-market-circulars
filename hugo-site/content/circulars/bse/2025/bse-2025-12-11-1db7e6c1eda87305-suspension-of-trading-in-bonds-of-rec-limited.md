## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in bonds of REC LIMITED (Rural Electrification Corporation Limited) effective December 16, 2025. The suspension applies to the 5.81% bonds maturing on December 31, 2025 (ISIN: INE020B08DH2, Scrip Code: 960313). The company has fixed the record date for redemption as December 16, 2025, and trading members are advised not to deal in these bonds from that date onwards.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension effective from December 16, 2025
- Applies to REC LIMITED bonds: 5.81%-31-12-25-PVT series
- ISIN: INE020B08DH2, BSE Scrip Code: 960313
- Record date for redemption: December 16, 2025
- Trading members advised not to deal in these bonds from the no-dealings date
- Notice reference: DR-778/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard operational notice for bond redemption procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified REC LIMITED bonds from December 16, 2025
- Market participants must note the suspension and avoid dealing in these securities
- Compliance with the no-dealings restriction is mandatory for all exchange members

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 11, 2025
- **Record Date**: December 16, 2025
- **No Dealings From**: December 16, 2025
- **Bond Maturity Date**: December 31, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and traders of this specific REC LIMITED bond series. With the bonds maturing on December 31, 2025 (just 15 days after suspension), this represents a routine end-of-life process for the debt instrument. Investors holding these bonds will receive redemption proceeds based on the December 16 record date. The suspension prevents any last-minute trading that could create settlement complications during the redemption process. Market liquidity impact is minimal as these are private placement bonds nearing maturity.
