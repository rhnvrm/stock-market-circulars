The circular provides consolidated lists of all securities currently under various ASM stages.

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities that meet specific criteria related to price volatility, volume patterns, or other market integrity concerns. Securities under LT-ASM face additional trading restrictions designed to protect investors and maintain market stability.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with LT-ASM framework requirements for the affected securities
- Enhanced due diligence and investor awareness measures apply to these securities
- Different ASM stages may have varying levels of surveillance measures including margin requirements and price bands
- Stage IV securities face the strictest surveillance measures under the framework

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 08, 2025 - New LT-ASM classifications become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 7 securities to LT-ASM and one to direct Stage IV indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny. These measures typically result in reduced liquidity and increased trading costs for affected securities.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will face additional restrictions and should exercise enhanced caution. The surveillance measures are protective in nature but may impact trading flexibility.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to update their systems and risk management frameworks to account for the LT-ASM status of these securities, including any applicable margin requirements and position limits.
