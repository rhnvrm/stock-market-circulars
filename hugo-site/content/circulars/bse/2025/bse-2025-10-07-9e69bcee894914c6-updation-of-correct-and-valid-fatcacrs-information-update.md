title: Postponement of Revised FATCA/CRS Document ID Type Activation on BSE StAR MF
  Platform
---

## Summary

BSE has postponed the activation of revised FATCA/CRS document ID types received from RTAs (Registrar and Transfer Agents) on the BSE StAR MF platform. The update was originally scheduled to go live on October 7, 2025, as per Notice No. 20251003-52 dated October 3, 2025. The revised go-live date will be communicated through a separate notice.

## Key Points

- Revised document ID types from both RTAs will not be activated as scheduled on October 7, 2025
- Implementation has been postponed till further notice
- Original notice reference: Notice No. 20251003-52 dated October 3, 2025
- Revised document ID types were detailed in Annexure II of the original notice
- New go-live date to be communicated via separate notice
- Members can contact Mutual Fund Helpdesk at 022-45720450 and 022-45720650 (8:00am to 7:00pm on business days)
- Queries can be raised through CRS portal: https://bsecrs.bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular postpones a previously announced system update related to FATCA/CRS compliance documentation.

## Compliance Requirements

No immediate compliance action required from members. Members should await further notice regarding the revised implementation date for the updated FATCA/CRS document ID types on BSE StAR MF platform.

## Important Dates

- **October 3, 2025**: Original notice issued (Notice No. 20251003-52)
- **October 7, 2025**: Originally scheduled go-live date (now postponed)
- **TBA**: Revised go-live date (to be communicated via separate notice)

## Impact Assessment

The postponement has minimal market impact as it relates to an administrative system update for FATCA/CRS documentation processing. The delay does not affect current mutual fund trading operations or existing FATCA/CRS compliance processes. Members can continue with existing procedures until the revised implementation date is announced. This is a routine operational update affecting back-office systems rather than trading activities.
