## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects shareholders of DARSHAN ORNA LIMITED who hold rights entitlements. Trading window is relatively short (5 days) requiring timely action from investors.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - trading members must ensure proper client communication, contract note disclaimers, and awareness of T+1 trade-for-trade settlement requirements. Demat-only trading requires proper infrastructure readiness.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders must decide within the trading period whether to exercise rights, renounce them for value, or allow them to lapse. Failure to act results in permanent loss of entitlements after November 21, 2025.
