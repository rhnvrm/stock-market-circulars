## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. The preferential allotment represents a small issuance (60,000 shares) to non-promoter entities through warrant conversion. The lock-in period until June 30, 2026, restricts immediate trading, preventing any short-term liquidity changes. This is a routine corporate action with limited implications for existing shareholders or market participants.
