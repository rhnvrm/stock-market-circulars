The revised framework introduces stricter price range limits of +3% from reference price and increases the minimum order size to Rs. 25 Crores. These changes will be effective from December 8, 2025, and apply to both regular equity trading and securities under optional T+0 settlement cycle.

- Implementation date: December 8, 2025

- Updated FAQs to be available on BSE website by December 8, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

### Price Range Modification
Orders placed in block deal windows must now be within +3% of the applicable reference price, compared to previous limits. This applies in the respective block deal windows and remains subject to surveillance measures and applicable price bands.

### Order Size Increase
The minimum order size for trade execution in block deal windows has been set at Rs. 25 Crores, representing a significant threshold for block deal participation.

### T+0 Settlement Inclusion
The revised provisions explicitly apply to securities traded under the optional T+0 settlement cycle, ensuring consistency across settlement mechanisms.

## Impact Assessment

### Market Impact
The tighter price range of +3% will reduce price volatility in block deals and may limit flexibility for institutional investors negotiating large transactions. The increased minimum order size of Rs. 25 Crores will restrict block deal participation to larger institutional players, potentially reducing the number of block deal transactions while maintaining their quality.

### Operational Impact
Brokers and institutional investors will need to update their trading systems, risk management frameworks, and execution strategies to comply with the new parameters. The inclusion of T+0 settlement securities ensures consistent treatment across different settlement cycles.

### Liquidity Impact
The higher minimum order size may concentrate block deal activity among larger institutions, potentially affecting liquidity dynamics. However, the tighter price range could enhance price discovery and reduce information asymmetry in block deals.
