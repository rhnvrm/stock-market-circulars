## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - Complete trading suspension affects liquidity and ability to transact in three debenture series. Investors will be unable to buy or sell these securities from the suspension date.

**Investor Impact:** High - Debenture holders need to be aware of the suspension and upcoming redemption. Those seeking to exit positions must do so before November 27, 2025.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their systems and client communications to reflect the suspension. The suspension applies to all three debenture series simultaneously, requiring coordinated operational changes.

**Duration:** The suspension is linked to the redemption event. Based on the nomenclature (12-12-25 in two series names), redemption appears imminent for at least two of the three series.
