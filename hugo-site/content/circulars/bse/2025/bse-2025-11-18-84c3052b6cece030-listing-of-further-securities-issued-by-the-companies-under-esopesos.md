## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard administrative notification for listing of securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities available for trading
- Standard trading procedures apply to these newly listed securities
- No special compliance requirements or restrictions
- No lock-in period applicable for any of the securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** November 18, 2025
- **Listing and Trading Effective Date:** November 19, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The total number of shares being listed (548,262 shares across 11 companies) represents a small fraction of the existing float for these companies. ESOP/ESOS listings are routine corporate actions that typically have negligible price impact.

**Liquidity Impact:** Marginal increase in available shares for trading, though the quantum is small enough to not materially affect liquidity in these securities.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders may experience minimal dilution. These shares were already accounted for in the diluted share count and are part of standard employee compensation practices.

**Operational Impact:** None for trading members beyond awareness of additional shares available for trading in these scrips.
