- SJVN Limited (Scrip Code: 533206) recently announced Q1 FY2025-26 results on August 11, 2025, which may have influenced trading
- Sonata Software Limited (Stock Code: 532221) provided standard compliance confirmation
- All companies confirm they have made proper disclosures under Regulation 30 of SEBI Listing Regulations
- No material undisclosed information identified by any company

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes mentioned in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must respond to BSE surveillance queries regarding unusual volume movements
- Continued compliance with Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015
- Prompt disclosure of all material events and information to stock exchanges

## Important Dates

- August 11, 2025: SJVN Board meeting for Q1 FY2025-26 results approval
- August 13, 2025: Date of clarification letters from all three companies

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as these are routine surveillance clarifications. The volume increases appear to be normal market activity rather than any material undisclosed events. Companies' responses suggest transparent market operations with no regulatory concerns.
