## Impact Assessment

Low impact event. This is a routine short-term debt instrument listing that primarily affects institutional investors and debt market participants. The high credit ratings (A1+ from both CRISIL and ICRA) indicate strong creditworthiness. The discount to face value (issue price of Rs. 4,91,845.50 vs face value of Rs. 5,00,000) provides implied interest return. This listing adds to the money market instruments available for trading on BSE's debt segment but has no material impact on broader market operations or retail investors.
