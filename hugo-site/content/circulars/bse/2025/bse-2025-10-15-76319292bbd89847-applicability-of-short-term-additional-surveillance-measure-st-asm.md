**Trading Impact:**
Securities added to ST-ASM framework will face enhanced surveillance and potential trading restrictions based on their stage classification. This may include price bands, additional margin requirements, or other measures designed to curb excessive volatility.

**Market Participants:**
Traders and investors in the affected securities should expect closer monitoring and possible trading limitations. The movement of some securities to LT-ASM or ESM frameworks indicates ongoing concerns requiring longer-term or enhanced surveillance.

**Investor Protection:**
The ST-ASM framework is designed to protect investors by identifying and monitoring securities showing abnormal price movements or trading patterns, helping to prevent market manipulation and excessive speculation.
