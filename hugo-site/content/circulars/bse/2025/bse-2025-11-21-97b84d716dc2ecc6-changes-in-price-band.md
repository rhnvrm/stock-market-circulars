title: Changes in Price Band for 35 Securities - Effective November 24, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced revised price bands for 35 securities effective from November 24, 2025. The price bands range from 2% to 20%, with the majority of securities (27 out of 35) being assigned a 5% price band. This revision indicates enhanced surveillance measures for these scrips.

## Key Points

- 35 securities will have revised price bands effective November 24, 2025
- 27 securities revised to 5% price band
- 4 securities revised to 10% price band (CLN Energy, Colorchips New Media, Eighty Jewellers, Viji Finance)
- 1 security revised to 20% price band (Athena Constructions)
- 1 security revised to 2% price band (UTL Industries - most restrictive)
- Notice issued by Surveillance Department
- Notice Number: 20251121-56
- Contact email for clarifications: bse.surv@bse india.com

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements price band revisions as part of BSE's surveillance mechanism. Price bands are circuit filters that limit price movement of securities within a trading day. Tighter price bands (lower percentages) indicate enhanced surveillance and restrict price volatility.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised price bands effective November 24, 2025
- All trades in the affected securities must comply with the new price band limits
- Trading systems should be updated to reflect the revised price bands before the effective date
- Members requiring clarifications should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 21, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revision affects 35 securities, mostly small and mid-cap stocks. The predominantly restrictive 5% bands suggest these securities are under enhanced surveillance, likely due to volatility concerns or other risk factors.

**Trading Impact**: Tighter price bands will limit intraday price movements, reducing volatility but also potentially impacting liquidity. The 2% band on UTL Industries is particularly restrictive.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in these securities will experience limited price movement capabilities during trading sessions, which may affect trading strategies and exit opportunities for large positions.
