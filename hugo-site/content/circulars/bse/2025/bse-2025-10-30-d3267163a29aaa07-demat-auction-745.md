## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. While this is a routine operational activity, the auction involves significant quantities of some securities (e.g., 170,011 shares of Harshil Agro, 8,002 shares of YES Bank) which could experience temporary price volatility during auction execution.

**Operational Impact**: Standard settlement procedure affecting brokers and trading members who have delivery obligations. The auction mechanism ensures settlement completion when regular delivery fails.

**Investor Impact**: Minimal direct impact on retail investors. Institutional participants with positions in listed securities may experience temporary liquidity effects during the auction window.
