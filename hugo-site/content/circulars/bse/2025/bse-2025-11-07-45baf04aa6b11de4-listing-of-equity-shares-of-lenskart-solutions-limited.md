## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - This is a significant IPO listing with over 173 crore equity shares. The staggered lock-in periods will impact share availability and liquidity in phases, with the first unlock occurring on December 5, 2025 for anchor investors.

**Liquidity:** Approximately 26.63 crore shares (15.4%) are not under lock-in and available for immediate trading, including shares held by IPO public, ESOP trust, AIFs, and employee ESOP holders. The remaining shares will become available progressively through 2026-2027.

**Investor Considerations:** Investors should note the lock-in schedules as they will significantly affect the float and trading dynamics. The majority of promoter and institutional holdings are locked in for 6-18 months, providing stability but limiting liquidity.
