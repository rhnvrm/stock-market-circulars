## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market-wide impact as it relates specifically to a takeover offer for SHREE PACETRONIX LIMITED. The impact is primarily confined to:

1. **Shareholders of SHREEPAC**: Opportunity to tender shares at Rs. 100 per share during the acquisition window
2. **Trading Members**: Must facilitate bidding process for eligible investors with demat holdings
3. **Custodian Members**: Need to manage the acceptance and settlement process

The offer size of up to 9,75,000 shares represents a company-specific corporate action with no broader market implications. Trading members handling SHREEPAC transactions need to ensure proper UCC registration and compliance with OTB operational procedures.
