title: Prior Instructions Required for IPO Bid Placement by Trading Members
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a compliance reminder to trading members regarding IPO bid placement procedures. Inspections revealed that some trading members uploaded IPO bids without obtaining prior instructions from clients. Trading members must obtain physical or electronic instructions from clients before placing any IPO bids, as mandated by SEBI circulars from 2018-2019.

## Key Points

- Prior physical or electronic instructions from clients are mandatory before IPO bid placement
- Investors must submit complete bid-cum-application forms to designated intermediaries
- Intermediaries must provide acknowledgement to investors upon receipt of applications (counter foil or application number)
- Physical application forms with UPI payment must be retained for 6 months, then forwarded to issuer/Registrar
- Electronic application records must be maintained for minimum 3 years
- Clients can also submit IPO bids through online platforms using secure login credentials
