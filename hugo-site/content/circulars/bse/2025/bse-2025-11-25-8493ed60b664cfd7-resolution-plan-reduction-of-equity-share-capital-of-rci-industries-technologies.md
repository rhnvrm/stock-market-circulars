## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Immediate and complete trading suspension eliminates liquidity for existing shareholders
- Existing GSM restrictions indicate prior market concerns about the stock

**Shareholder Impact:**
- **Promoters**: Complete loss of shareholding with zero recovery
- **Public Shareholders**: Catastrophic impact with 95% shareholding extinguishment, retaining only 5% of restructured capital
- Severe wealth erosion for all existing equity holders

**Operational Impact:**
- Company undergoing resolution plan suggests financial distress or insolvency proceedings
- Capital restructuring indicates debt resolution through equity dilution/extinguishment
- Post-implementation capital structure will be fundamentally different with new shareholders likely entering as part of resolution plan

**Corporate Governance:**
- NCLT oversight ensures legal compliance in restructuring process
- Removal of existing promoters signals complete change in control and management potential
- Public shareholders face near-total loss despite minority retention in restructured entity
