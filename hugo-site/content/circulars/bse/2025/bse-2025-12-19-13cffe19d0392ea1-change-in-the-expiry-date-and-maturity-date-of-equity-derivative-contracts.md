## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. All market participants trading equity derivatives expiring in March 2026 will need to adjust their trading strategies, position management, and expiry-related plans by one day. This includes retail traders, institutional investors, arbitrageurs, and hedgers.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems are updated to reflect the new expiry date. Any automated trading strategies or expiry-based algorithms need recalibration. Settlement and clearing operations must be adjusted accordingly.

**Risk Management Impact**: Risk management systems and margin calculations for March 2026 contracts need to be updated. Position limits and expiry-day volatility management strategies may require adjustment.

**Advance Notice**: The change is being announced approximately three months in advance, providing adequate time for system updates and operational adjustments.
