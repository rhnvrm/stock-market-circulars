## Regulatory Changes

This represents a relaxation of trading restrictions typically imposed on newly listed SME IPOs.

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The transition from Trade for Trade to Rolling settlement will improve liquidity and ease of trading for PAJSON AGRO INDIA LIMITED shares. Investors will benefit from standard settlement cycles instead of immediate delivery requirements.

**Operational Impact**: Trading Members need to reconfigure trading terminals and update internal systems to reflect the new group classification. The change indicates the company has completed initial stabilization period post-SME IPO listing.

**Liquidity Impact**: Positive. Rolling settlement typically attracts more participants and trading volume compared to restrictive Trade for Trade mechanisms, potentially improving price discovery and market depth for the scrip.
