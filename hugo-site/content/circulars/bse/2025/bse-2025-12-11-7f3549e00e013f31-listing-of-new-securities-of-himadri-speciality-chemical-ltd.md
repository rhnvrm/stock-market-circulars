- All allotted shares are subject to lock-in periods until the specified dates in June 2026
- Allottees cannot transfer or sell these shares until the lock-in period expires
- The company must comply with BSE listing requirements for these new securities

## Important Dates

- **Listing Date**: December 11, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry (Batch 1)**: June 14, 2026 (6 allottees, 177,000 shares)
- **Lock-in Expiry (Batch 2)**: June 19, 2026 (8 allottees, 130,800 shares)

## Impact Assessment

The listing of 307,800 new equity shares represents a relatively small issuance unlikely to materially impact Himadri Speciality Chemical Ltd.'s stock price or trading volumes. The lock-in periods extending to June 2026 ensure these shares will not immediately enter the tradable float, preventing any potential dilution effect on existing shareholders in the near term. This appears to be a standard employee stock option or preferential allotment exercise with minimal broader market implications.
