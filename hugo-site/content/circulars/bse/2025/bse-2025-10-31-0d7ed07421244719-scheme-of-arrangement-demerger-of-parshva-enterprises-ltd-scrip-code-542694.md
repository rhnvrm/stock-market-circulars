## Impact Assessment

**For Parshva Enterprises Shareholders:**
- Existing shareholders will receive additional shares in Simandhar Impex Limited without any payment
- Shareholding in Parshva Enterprises will continue but the company will operate without the jewellery business post-demerger
- Trading restrictions (T Group classification and call auction) may impact liquidity and price discovery temporarily

**Market Operations Impact:**
- Transfer to 'T' Group introduces trade-for-trade settlement, eliminating intraday trading and increasing settlement risk
- Call auction mechanism on ex-date may result in volatile price movements as single equilibrium price is discovered
- Liquidity may be constrained during the transition period

**Corporate Structure Impact:**
- Clear separation of jewellery business into a dedicated entity (Simandhar Impex Limited)
- Both entities can focus on their core business operations independently
- Potential for improved valuation as businesses are delineated

**Listing Impact:**
- New listing of Simandhar Impex Limited shares will expand investment universe
- Existing shareholders gain exposure to standalone jewellery business entity
- Subject to successful completion of listing formalities by Simandhar Impex Limited
