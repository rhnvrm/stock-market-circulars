---

## Summary

The company will issue 3 equity shares of Re. 1/- each at a premium of Rs. 1799 per share (total issue price Rs. 1800) for every 25 equity shares held. Trading on ex-rights basis will commence from November 17, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-757/2025-2026).

## Key Points

- Rights ratio: 3 new equity shares for every 25 existing shares held
- Issue price: Rs. 1800 per share (Face value Re. 1 + Premium Rs. 1799)
- Payment structure: Rs. 900 on application and Rs. 900 on subsequent call(s)
- Record date: November 17, 2025
- Ex-rights trading commences: November 17, 2025
- Settlement number: DR-757/2025-2026
- Applies to dematerialised securities in rolling settlement segment

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action notification as per existing SEBI and BSE guidelines for rights issues.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must execute all transactions in Adani Enterprises Ltd equity shares on ex-rights basis from November 17, 2025
- Investors holding shares as of the record date (November 17, 2025) will be eligible to participate in the rights issue
- Rights entitlement will be credited to eligible shareholders based on holdings on record date

## Important Dates

- **November 12, 2025**: Circular issued by BSE
- **November 17, 2025**: Record date for rights issue eligibility
- **November 17, 2025**: Ex-rights trading begins (Settlement DR-757/2025-2026)
- **Payment schedule**: Rs. 900 on application; Rs. 900 on one or more subsequent calls

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders need to decide whether to subscribe to their rights entitlement. Those not participating will face dilution of their ownership percentage. The split payment structure (Rs. 900 on application and Rs. 900 on call) provides flexibility but requires commitment to future payment obligations.

**Market Impact**: The stock will trade ex-rights from November 17, 2025, which typically results in a theoretical price adjustment. The rights issue represents a significant capital raising exercise for Adani Enterprises, one of India's largest conglomerates.

**Trading Impact**: All market participants must ensure systems and processes account for ex-rights trading from the specified date. The rights entitlement will trade separately, allowing shareholders to sell their rights if they choose not to subscribe.
