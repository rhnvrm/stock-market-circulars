title: TRAI Mandatory Phase-wise Adoption of 1600-Series Numbers for BFSI Entities
---

## Summary

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a Direction dated November 19, 2025, under section 13 read with section 11 of the TRAI Act, 1997, mandating phase-wise implementation of 1600-series numbers by entities regulated by RBI, SEBI and PFRDA. The Direction requires BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) sector entities to use the dedicated 1600-series for all service and transactional voice calls instead of ten-digit mobile numbers. This measure aims to curb promotional calls disguised as service calls and provide consumers with a distinct caller identity to make informed decisions about call acceptance.

## Key Points

- TRAI has directed mandatory adoption of 1600-series numbers for service and transactional voice calls by RBI, SEBI and PFRDA regulated entities
- The 1600-series numbering was allocated by Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on December 23, 2024, exclusively for Government entities and BFSI sector
- Implementation will be done in phases as specified by TRAI
- Current adoption rates by BFSI entities remain low despite consumer awareness campaigns
- Most entities continue using ten-digit mobile numbers for service and transactional calls
- Direction issued under Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018
- Access Providers were directed on December 31, 2024, to initiate allocation of the numbering series

## Regulatory Changes

TRAI has mandated that all commercial communications by registered Senders must use registered headers or number resources from special series assigned for commercial communications (Regulation 3 of the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018). The new Direction specifically requires:

- Exclusive use of 1600-series for service and transactional voice calls by BFSI entities
- Prohibition of using ten-digit mobile numbers for such communications
- Phase-wise mandatory implementation timeline for RBI, SEBI and PFRDA regulated entities
- Telecom resources of non-compliant Senders may be suspended or disconnected

## Compliance Requirements

**Applicable to:**
- All entities regulated by Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
- All entities regulated by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
- All entities regulated by Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)

**Requirements:**
- Register with Access Providers for 1600-series number allocation
- Migrate all service and transactional voice calls to 1600-series numbers
- Discontinue use of ten-digit mobile numbers for service and transactional communications
- Comply with phase-wise implementation schedule as directed
- Ensure all commercial communications use only registered headers or allocated number resources

**Consequences of Non-compliance:**
- Telecom resources may be suspended
- Services may be disconnected
- Regulatory action by respective sector regulators (RBI, SEBI, PFRDA)

## Important Dates

- **December 23, 2024**: DoT allocated 1600-series numbering for Government and BFSI entities
- **December 31, 2024**: TRAI directed Access Providers to initiate allocation of 1600-series
- **November 19, 2025**: TRAI Direction for mandatory phase-wise adoption issued
- **Phase-wise implementation**: Specific timelines to be announced by TRAI in consultation with sector regulators

## Impact Assessment

**Consumer Protection:**
- Enhanced ability to identify legitimate service and transactional calls from BFSI entities
- Reduction in spam and potential scam calls disguised as service communications
- Improved consumer decision-making on call acceptance
- Better protection against fraudulent calls

**Industry Impact:**
- All BFSI entities must upgrade their calling systems and infrastructure
- Need for customer awareness campaigns about new numbering system
- Operational changes required in call center operations and automated calling systems
- Investment required in technology migration and customer communication

**Market Operations:**
- Affects all banks, financial services companies, insurance companies, stock brokers, pension funds and other BFSI entities
- Telecommunications service providers must facilitate smooth migration
- Sector regulators (RBI, SEBI, PFRDA) will monitor compliance
- Low current adoption indicates significant industry-wide changes required

**Regulatory Significance:**
- Major step in curbing unsolicited commercial communications
- Strengthens existing Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018
- Demonstrates inter-regulatory coordination between TRAI, RBI, SEBI and PFRDA
- Sets precedent for sector-specific numbering series allocation
