## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Limited to shareholders and traders of BAID FINSERV LIMITED. The short 4-day trading window for renunciation (November 25-28) requires prompt action from investors wishing to trade their rights.

**Operational Impact**: Trading Members handling BAID FINSERV LIMITED clients must ensure proper client communication regarding RE trading mechanics, settlement requirements, and disclaimer obligations. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis requires appropriate operational readiness.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders must decide within the renunciation window whether to subscribe, renounce (sell), or allow their rights to lapse. Failure to act results in automatic lapse post-December 03, 2025.
