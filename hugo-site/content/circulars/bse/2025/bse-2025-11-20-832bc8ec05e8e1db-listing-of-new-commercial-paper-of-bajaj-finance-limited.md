## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt market listing with minimal impact on overall market operations. The commercial paper provides short-term funding for Bajaj Finance Limited with a 91-day maturity period. The listing is limited to the BSE Debt segment and does not affect equity trading. Given the private placement nature and institutional participation in commercial paper markets, retail investor impact is negligible.
