## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The listing involves a relatively small number of shares (80,000) representing modest capital raising through warrant conversion. The shares are subject to lock-in periods ranging from approximately 6-18 months from listing date, which will limit immediate supply in the market.
