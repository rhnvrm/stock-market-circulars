## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x and proportionally reduce the share price, making the stock more accessible to retail investors. This is a routine corporate action with no impact on market capitalization.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and depository participants must update their systems to handle the new ISIN from the ex-date. Investors' demat accounts will reflect the increased number of shares at reduced face value. No action is required from existing shareholders as the sub-division will be automatically processed by depositories.
