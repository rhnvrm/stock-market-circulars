## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: This schedule is critical for operational planning by brokers, custodians, depositories, and clearing corporations. All market participants must align their internal settlement processes, fund management, and securities delivery systems with these dates.

**Market Impact**: Minimal direct market impact as this is a routine monthly schedule. However, proper adherence ensures smooth market functioning and timely settlement of trades.

**Member Impact**: Members must ensure adequate liquidity and securities availability on specified pay-in dates. The T+1 cycle provides one business day for settlement preparation, while T+0 requires same-day settlement capability.

**Custodian Impact**: Custodians have tight deadlines for confirming OTR transactions (by 7:30 AM T+1) and 6A/7A data, requiring robust overnight processing systems.

**Risk Management**: The schedule includes auction settlements (RA series) on T+2 for T+1 settlement shortages, providing a mechanism to address delivery failures and maintain market integrity.
