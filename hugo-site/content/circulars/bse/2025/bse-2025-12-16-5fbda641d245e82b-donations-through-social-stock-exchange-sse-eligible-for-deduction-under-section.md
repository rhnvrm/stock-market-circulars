## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** This clarification is expected to enhance the attractiveness of the Social Stock Exchange platform by providing clarity on tax benefits available to donors. It may encourage increased participation from both NPOs and donors in the SSE ecosystem.

**Compliance Impact:** NPOs on the SSE platform need to ensure they maintain valid Section 80G registration to offer tax benefits to donors. This may require additional compliance efforts for organizations not currently registered.

**Stakeholder Impact:** Positive for donors seeking tax-efficient ways to contribute to social causes, and for NPOs looking to attract funding through the SSE platform with the added incentive of tax deductibility.
