## Impact Assessment

This is a routine preferential allotment listing for ALAN SCOTT ENTERPRISES LIMITED. The issuance of 2,70,000 shares to non-promoters will result in dilution of existing shareholding. The lock-in period of approximately 6 months ensures stability and prevents immediate selling pressure. The impact is limited to this specific scrip with no broader market implications.
