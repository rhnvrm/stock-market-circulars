**Market Impact:** Medium - New listing adds to the market with substantial promoter holding indicating strong commitment. The 75% promoter stake suggests limited free float initially, which may impact liquidity.

**Investor Impact:** The high promoter holding (75%) demonstrates strong promoter confidence while meeting minimum public shareholding norms (25%). The significant number of public shareholders (411,989) indicates broad retail participation. High dematerialization rate (88.32%) facilitates easy trading.

**Corporate Governance:** Transparent disclosure of nominee arrangements where three individuals hold shares on behalf of promoter Orkla ASA. No encumbrances on promoter shares indicate clean shareholding structure.
