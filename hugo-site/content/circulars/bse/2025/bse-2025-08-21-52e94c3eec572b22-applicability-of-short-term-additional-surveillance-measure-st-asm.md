- No securities moving to higher or lower stage ASM within the framework
- Framework includes SME scrips and T+0 scrips based on parent company classification
- Securities moving out are transitioning to other surveillance frameworks (ESM, LT-ASM, etc.)

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework changes with specific securities being added or removed based on trading patterns and risk assessment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of surveillance measures applicable to listed securities
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting requirements for securities under ST-ASM
