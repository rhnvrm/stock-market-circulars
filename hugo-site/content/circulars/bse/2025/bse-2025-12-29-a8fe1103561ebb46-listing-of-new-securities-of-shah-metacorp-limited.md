## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The preferential allotment of over 25.58 crore shares represents significant equity dilution for Shah Metacorp Limited. The lock-in provisions (total locked shares: 25,58,32,190) will restrict supply until 2026-2027.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders face dilution from the large preferential issue. The staggered lock-in periods (1-year and 2-year) indicate a mix of promoter and non-promoter participation.

**Trading Impact:** The new shares are immediately tradeable from December 30, 2025, subject to lock-in restrictions. The issue price of Rs. 4.71/- provides a reference point for market participants.
