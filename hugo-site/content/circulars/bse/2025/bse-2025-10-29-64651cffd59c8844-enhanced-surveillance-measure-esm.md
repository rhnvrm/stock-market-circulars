## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework continues BSE's surveillance mechanism to monitor securities with unusual price movements, high volatility, or abnormal trading patterns. Securities under ESM face additional trading restrictions and monitoring:

- Stage-wise escalation based on continued surveillance concerns
- Trade-for-trade settlement requirements
- Additional margin requirements
- Periodic price bands

## Compliance Requirements

**For Investors:**
- Securities under ESM are subject to trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday trading)
- Higher margin requirements apply
- Price bands may be applicable
- Enhanced disclosure requirements from listed companies

**For Listed Companies:**
- Must comply with enhanced disclosure norms
- Required to provide explanations for price movements
- Subject to increased scrutiny by exchange surveillance

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 30, 2025
- **Circular Date:** October 29, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Moderate impact on affected securities with potential liquidity constraints
- Trade-for-trade settlement reduces intraday trading opportunities
- Higher margin requirements may reduce speculative trading

**Investor Impact:**
- Investors holding these securities face trading restrictions
- Additional margins required for new positions
- Reduced liquidity may impact exit strategies
- Signals heightened regulatory concern about price movements

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers must implement enhanced margin collection
- Settlement cycles adjusted for trade-for-trade mode
- Risk management systems must flag ESM securities

The ESM framework is a preventive measure to protect investor interests and maintain market integrity. Securities can graduate to higher stages or exit ESM based on compliance and trading pattern normalization.
