## Summary

Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Ltd (Scrip Code: 543273) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs.10/- will be sub-divided into two equity shares of Rs.5/- each. The record date for this corporate action has been set as December 22, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Ltd
- Scrip Code: 543273
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Current Face Value: Rs.10/- per share
- New Face Value: Rs.5/- per share
- Split Ratio: 1:2 (One share of Rs.10/- into two shares of Rs.5/-)
- Segment: Equity - Dematerialised Securities Rolling Settlement
- Notice Number: DR-782/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN No. INE0CJD01011 (Rs.10/- paid up) will not be valid for transactions on the Exchange on or after December 22, 2025. A new ISIN number for Rs.5/- paid up shares will be communicated to the market through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that the old ISIN will become invalid from the record date
- All transactions on or after December 22, 2025 must use the new ISIN for Rs.5/- shares
- Market participants should update their systems and records accordingly

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: December 22, 2025
- **Effective Date for Sub-Division**: December 22, 2025
- **Old ISIN Validity**: Valid until December 21, 2025
- **Notice Date**: November 26, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive two shares of Rs.5/- face value for every one share of Rs.10/- face value held as of the record date. The total investment value remains unchanged, only the number of shares doubles.

**Trading Impact**: Post sub-division, the stock price is expected to adjust proportionately, making shares more accessible to retail investors at a lower price point. Liquidity may improve due to lower price per share.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems are updated to reflect the new ISIN and face value to avoid transaction errors after the record date.
