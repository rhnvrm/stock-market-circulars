## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this is a routine government securities auction process. The circular primarily affects debt market participants, institutional investors, and retail investors seeking fixed-income government securities. The total issue size of Rs. 28,000 crores provides liquidity in the G-Sec market. No impact on equity markets or specific company stocks. The non-competitive bidding facility allows smaller investors to participate in government securities auctions without competing on price, promoting financial inclusion in debt markets.
