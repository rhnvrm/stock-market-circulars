## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to a single company's preferential allotment. The addition of 8.515 million shares increases the company's equity base. For VASHU BHAGNANI INDUSTRIES LIMITED shareholders, this represents dilution through preferential allotment. The staggered lock-in periods (ending June 2026 and June 2027) will restrict immediate selling by allottees, potentially limiting supply pressure on the stock.
