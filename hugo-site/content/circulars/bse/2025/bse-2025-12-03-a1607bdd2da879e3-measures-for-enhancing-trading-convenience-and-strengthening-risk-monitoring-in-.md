  in Equity Derivatives

## Summary

Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd (ICCL) has implemented a new risk management framework for the pre-open session in the Equity Derivatives segment. All orders during pre-open will be subject to mandatory margin sufficiency checks at the order level before inclusion. The framework applies SPAN + ELM margins without netting benefits, calendar spread advantages, or cross-margining during the pre-open session. This circular follows SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2025/79 dated May 29, 2025.

## Key Points

- All pre-open orders must pass margin sufficiency checks at order level before acceptance
- Incoming orders subject to pre-risk management for SPAN + ELM margins at contract level
- Risk parameters and maximum executable price considered during pre-open session
- Order level margins assessed along with client's brought forward portfolio at clearing member level
- No netting of pre-open orders with brought forward portfolio or earlier offsetting pre-open orders
- For offsetting pre-open orders at client contract level, higher of SPAN+ELM (long or short side) is considered
- Margin benefits from calendar spreads and cross-margining not applicable during pre-open session
- Framework applies to both single stock and index derivatives

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements point 5.6 of SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2025/79 regarding "Pre-open session for the derivatives market". Key regulatory changes include:

- Mandatory pre-risk management checks for all pre-open session orders
- Elimination of netting benefits during pre-open session
- Application of gross margining approach (higher of long/short side for offsetting positions)
- Removal of calendar spread and cross-margin benefits during pre-open
- Comprehensive margin sufficiency assessment at clearing member level combining new orders and existing portfolios

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Ensure all client orders during pre-open session meet margin sufficiency requirements
- Implement systems to calculate SPAN + ELM margins at contract level during pre-open
- Monitor overall margin sufficiency at clearing member level including brought forward portfolios
- Accept orders only when aggregate margin requirements (new orders + existing portfolio) are met

**For Clients:**
- Maintain adequate margins to support orders placed during pre-open session
- Understand that netting, calendar spread, and cross-margin benefits are not available during pre-open
- Ensure sufficient margin cover considering gross exposure on offsetting positions

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 03, 2025
- **Effective Date:** Immediate implementation
- **Reference SEBI Circular Date:** May 29, 2025
- **Reference ICCL Circular Date:** May 30, 2025 (circular no: 20250530-26)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Higher margin requirements during pre-open session may reduce order flow and liquidity
- Elimination of netting benefits increases capital requirements for market participants
- More conservative risk management approach enhances market stability

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members must upgrade systems to perform real-time margin calculations during pre-open
- Increased margin monitoring and risk management workload for clearing members
- Clients need to maintain higher margin buffers to participate in pre-open session

**Risk Management Impact:**
- Strengthened pre-trade risk controls reduce potential for margin shortfalls
