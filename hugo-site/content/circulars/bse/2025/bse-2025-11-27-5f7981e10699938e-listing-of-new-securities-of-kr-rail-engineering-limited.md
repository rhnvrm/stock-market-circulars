## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The listing of 96 lakh new shares increases the equity base of K&R Rail Engineering Limited. However, with 1.67 crore shares (including these new shares) locked until November 2026, the immediate free float impact is minimal.

**Liquidity Impact:** The lock-in on significant promoter holdings (75% of post-arrangement promoter shareholding) ensures stability and prevents immediate dilution pressure on the stock.

**Operational Impact:** This listing completes the scheme of arrangement between K&R Rail Engineering Limited and KVR Rail Infra Projects Private Limited, reflecting corporate restructuring activities.
