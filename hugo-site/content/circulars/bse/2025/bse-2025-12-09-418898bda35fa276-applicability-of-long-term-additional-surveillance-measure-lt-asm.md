## Summary

BSE has issued the list of securities under the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective December 10, 2025. Four new securities have been shortlisted for LT-ASM, and one security (Sri Adhikari Brothers Television Network Ltd) has been directly placed in Stage IV of the framework. No securities are moving out of the LT-ASM framework or being moved to higher/lower stages at this time.

## Key Points

- 4 new securities shortlisted for Long Term ASM Framework
- 1 security (Sri Adhikari Brothers Television Network Ltd) directly placed in Stage IV
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages
- No securities exiting the LT-ASM Framework
- Consolidated list includes 13+ securities across various ASM stages
- Framework effective from December 10, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework continues to apply enhanced surveillance measures to identify and monitor securities with aberrant price movements or unusual trading patterns. Securities under this framework face stricter trading conditions including higher margin requirements and potential trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

**New Securities in LT-ASM (Part A):**
1. Aayush Wellness Ltd (539528, INE430R01023)
2. Delphi World Money Ltd (533452, INE726L01019)
3. Gujarat Credit Corporation Ltd (511441, INE034B01019)
4. Maruti Interior Products Ltd (543464, INE0JSJ01014)

**Direct Stage IV Placement (Part D):**
1. Sri Adhikari Brothers Television Network Ltd (530943, INE416A01044) - as per NSE

**Trading Implications:**
- Enhanced surveillance monitoring
- Increased margin requirements
- Price and volume monitoring
- Potential circuit filter adjustments

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 10, 2025 - LT-ASM framework changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The addition of 4 securities to LT-ASM and direct Stage IV placement of 1 security will result in enhanced trading restrictions and higher margin requirements for these scrips. This typically leads to reduced liquidity and increased trading costs for investors.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities will face stricter trading conditions, higher margins, and potential price volatility due to reduced liquidity.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and trading members must ensure proper margin collection and surveillance compliance for these securities. Systems need to be updated to reflect the new ASM classifications.
