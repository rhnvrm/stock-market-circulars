## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of this specific privately placed debenture issue. This is a routine corporate action for debt redemption. Trading members holding or dealing in these debentures need to ensure no transactions occur from the suspension date. The suspension facilitates proper identification of debenture holders eligible for redemption as per the record date. Market-wide impact is minimal as this affects a single privately placed debt instrument.
