This listing represents a standard new equity listing on BSE. The staggered lock-in periods indicate a mix of promoter holdings (longer lock-ins) and other quota shares (shorter lock-ins). Investors should note the substantial locked-in portion which will gradually become tradeable between 2026-2028, potentially affecting liquidity and price dynamics as lock-ins expire.
