## Regulatory Changes

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 17, 2025
- **Listing Effective Date:** December 18, 2025 (Thursday)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares represents routine corporate activity and typically has minimal market impact as these issuances are relatively small compared to total outstanding shares. The shares issued range from 150 shares (Polycab India) to 1,163,301 shares (Sequent Scientific).

**Dilution Impact:** Minimal dilution for most companies given the relatively small number of shares being issued compared to their existing share capital.

**Trading Impact:** No restrictions on trading as none of the securities are under lock-in, allowing immediate liquidity.
