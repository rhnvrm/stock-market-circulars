## Summary

PGIM India Asset Management Private Limited has announced the resumption of subscriptions in three designated overseas fund of funds schemes effective December 08, 2025. The schemes - PGIM India Global Equity Opportunities Fund of Fund, PGIM India Emerging Markets Equity Fund of Fund, and PGIM India Global Select Real Estate Securities Fund of Fund - were temporarily suspended on November 17, 2025. Based on SEBI's permission dated June 17, 2022, the AMC will allow lumpsum investments up to INR 2 crore per day per investor per scheme, while fresh SIP/STP registrations remain prohibited.

## Key Points

- Subscriptions reopening for three PGIM India overseas fund of funds schemes from December 08, 2025
- Lumpsum investment limit: Maximum INR 2,00,00,000 per day, per investor, per scheme (at Primary holder PAN level)
- Limit applies to transactions received before cut-off time on any business day
- No fresh Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) or Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) registrations allowed
- No switch-ins permitted into these schemes
- Existing registered SIPs/STPs will continue unaffected
- Decision based on SEBI letter no. SEBI/HO/OW/IMD-II/DoF3/P/25095/2022 dated June 17, 2022

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has permitted Mutual Funds to accept subscriptions and invest in overseas funds/securities up to the headroom available without breaching overseas investment limits as of end of day February 1, 2022 at the Mutual Fund level. This regulatory framework allows AMCs to manage overseas investment limits while permitting controlled subscription inflows.

## Compliance Requirements

- Unit holders must update their PAN, KYC, email address, mobile number, and nominee details with the AMC
- Unit holders are advised to link their PAN with Aadhaar Number
- Investment limits of INR 2 crore per day per investor per scheme must be adhered to
- Investors should review the Investor Charter available on the Mutual Fund's website
- Investors should check for any unclaimed redemptions or Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) payments

## Important Dates

- **November 17, 2025**: Date of temporary suspension of subscriptions (as per referenced Notice Cum Addendum)
- **December 04, 2025**: Date of current notice issuance
- **December 08, 2025**: Effective date for resumption of subscriptions in designated schemes
- **June 17, 2022**: Date of SEBI letter permitting overseas investments up to available headroom
- **February 1, 2022**: Reference date for overseas investment limit calculation (end of day)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This circular affects only three specific overseas fund of funds schemes of PGIM India Mutual Fund and does not impact broader market operations or trading activities.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to existing and potential investors in the three designated PGIM India overseas fund of funds schemes. While subscriptions are reopening, the daily cap of INR 2 crore per investor per scheme may limit large institutional or high-net-worth individual investments. Retail investors can resume lumpsum investments but cannot register new SIPs or STPs.

**Operational Impact**: The AMC must monitor daily subscription limits at the PAN level to ensure compliance. Existing SIP/STP investors can continue their systematic investments, providing some stability to fund inflows. The restriction on fresh systematic plans may reduce the administrative burden of managing new registrations while controlling overall inflows.

**Regulatory Compliance**: The reopening is aligned with SEBI's framework for managing overseas investment limits, demonstrating the AMC's compliance with regulatory guidelines while balancing investor access to international investment opportunities.
