**Shut Periods:** Range from October 31, 2025 to November 26, 2025 across different securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects liquidity and trading strategies for 32 actively traded securities in the SLB segment during November 2025

**Operational Impact:** Market participants using SLB for hedging, arbitrage, or short-selling strategies must plan around these shut periods. The concentration of dividend ex-dates in early-to-mid November may impact overall SLB market liquidity during this period.

**Investor Considerations:** Short sellers and securities lenders should close or adjust positions before shut periods. Borrowers must ensure they can meet obligations without ability to borrow during shut periods. The HDFC AMC bonus issue requires special attention as it involves share multiplication rather than cash distribution.
