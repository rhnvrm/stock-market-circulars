## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective November 14, 2025. Three new securities are being added to the framework, one security will be moved to a lower stage, and nine securities are being removed from the framework. The ST-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance and trading restrictions to securities exhibiting unusual price or volume movements.

## Key Points

- 3 securities newly added to Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework: Anjani Foods Ltd, Pearl Global Industries Ltd, and Yatra Online Ltd
- 1 security moved to lower Stage ASM: Om Metallogic Ltd (SME scrip)
- 9 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework, with several transitioning to other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, Trade for Trade)
- Changes effective from November 14, 2025
- Framework includes both main board and SME securities
- Some securities marked with NSE coordination

## Regulatory Changes

**New Additions to ST-ASM (Stage I):**
- Anjani Foods Ltd (Scrip Code: 511153, ISIN: INE096I01021)
- Pearl Global Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 532808, ISIN: INE940H01022)
- Yatra Online Ltd (Scrip Code: 543992, ISIN: INE0JR601024)

**Movement to Lower Stage:**
- Om Metallogic Ltd (Scrip Code: 544559, ISIN: INE0R8Q01018) - SME scrip

**Securities Exiting ST-ASM:**
- Aravali Securities & Finance Ltd, Comfort Commotrade Ltd, Concord Drugs Ltd (moving to LT-ASM), Dredging Corporation of India Ltd, Fineotex Chemical Ltd, Murae Organisor Ltd, Swati Projects Ltd (SME, moving to LT-ASM), TD Power Systems Ltd, and Unison Metals Ltd

## Compliance Requirements

- Securities in ST-ASM framework are subject to enhanced surveillance measures including potential margin increases
- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable margin and position limit requirements for affected securities
- Securities may face additional disclosure requirements and trading restrictions based on their ASM stage
- Market participants should review exposure to affected securities and adjust positions accordingly
- Securities marked with special notations (@ for SME, * for NSE coordination, ~ for T+0) require attention to specific framework rules

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** November 14, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework come into effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
The addition of securities to ST-ASM typically results in reduced liquidity and increased trading costs due to higher margins. For the three newly added securities, investors may experience wider bid-ask spreads and reduced trading volumes. The removal of nine securities from the framework should improve their trading conditions and reduce costs for market participants.

**Investor Impact:**
Investors holding positions in newly added securities (Anjani Foods, Pearl Global Industries, Yatra Online) will face higher margin requirements and should evaluate their risk exposure. Those invested in securities exiting the framework will benefit from normalized trading conditions, though some are transitioning to other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM or Trade for Trade) which maintain certain restrictions.

**Operational Impact:**
Brokers and trading members must update their risk management systems to reflect the new margin requirements and trading restrictions for affected securities. The consolidated list indicates ongoing monitoring of multiple securities across different ASM stages, requiring continuous compliance oversight.
