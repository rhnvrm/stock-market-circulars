## Summary

BSE has announced that the equity shares of K K SILK MILLS LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544624) will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to the Rolling segment, shifting to M Group classification. This change will be effective from December 17, 2025, and represents a transition from the restricted trading framework typically applied to new SME IPO listings to regular rolling settlement.

## Key Points

- Stock: K K SILK MILLS LIMITED - SME IPO (Scrip Code: 544624)
- Current classification: Trade for Trade segment (MT Group)
- New classification: Rolling segment (M Group)
- Effective date: December 17, 2025
- This follows the previous notice No. 20251202-48 dated December 02, 2025
- Contact person: Mr. Anurag Jain (Tel: 022-2272 8822)

## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for K K SILK MILLS LIMITED will change from Trade for Trade (T2T) basis to Rolling settlement. Under T2T, all transactions must result in delivery with no intraday trading allowed. Moving to Rolling segment enables:

- Intraday trading opportunities
- Standard T+1 settlement cycle
- Normal margin requirements instead of 100% upfront payment
- Greater liquidity and trading flexibility

## Compliance Requirements

## Important Dates

- **December 02, 2025**: Previous related notice issued (Notice No. 20251202-48)
- **December 03, 2025**: Current notice issued (Notice No. 20251203-2)
- **December 17, 2025**: Effective date for transfer to Rolling segment (M Group)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The transition from T2T to Rolling segment is generally positive for market participants as it increases liquidity and trading flexibility. This is a standard progression for SME IPO stocks after the initial stabilization period.

**Trading Impact**: Traders will gain the ability to conduct intraday trading, which was previously restricted. This may lead to increased trading volumes and improved price discovery.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to ensure their systems are updated before December 17, 2025, to accommodate the new group classification and settlement mechanics.
