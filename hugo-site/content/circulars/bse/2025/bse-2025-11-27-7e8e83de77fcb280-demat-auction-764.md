## Impact Assessment

Low market impact. This is a routine operational activity that affects only specific trades where delivery obligations were not met in the regular settlement cycle. The auction mechanism ensures trade completion and maintains market integrity. Impact is limited to:

- Brokers/clients who failed to deliver securities in regular settlement
- Buyers awaiting delivery of these specific securities
- May result in price volatility for illiquid scrips during auction
- No broader market implications beyond ensuring settlement finality
