title: Non-Business Day for certain schemes of Mutual Fund on BSE StAR MF Platform
  - November 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has notified non-business days for certain mutual fund schemes on the BSE StAR MF Platform for November 2025. This affects specific international Fund of Fund schemes from Bandhan Mutual Fund and Invesco Mutual Fund, which will not process transactions on the specified dates due to holidays in their underlying international markets.

## Key Points

- Bandhan US Treasury Bond 0-1 year Fund of Fund will be closed on November 11, 2025
- Four Invesco international Fund of Fund schemes will be closed on November 11, 2025
- The same four Invesco schemes will also be closed on November 27, 2025
- Affected Invesco schemes include: Pan European Equity FoF, Global Equity Income FoF, Global Consumer Trends FoF, and EQQQ Nasdaq-100 ETF FoF
- No transactions will be processed for these schemes on the specified non-business days

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational notification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors should note that purchase, redemption, and switch transactions for the affected schemes will not be processed on the specified non-business days
- BSE StAR MF platform participants should update their systems to reflect these non-business days
- AMCs must ensure proper communication to distributors and investors about these closures

## Important Dates

- **November 11, 2025**: Non-business day for Bandhan US Treasury Bond 0-1 year FoF and all four Invesco international FoFs
- **November 27, 2025**: Non-business day for all four Invesco international FoFs

## Impact Assessment

The impact is minimal and limited to investors of the specific international Fund of Fund schemes mentioned. These closures are due to holidays in the underlying international markets (likely US and European markets). Investors planning transactions in these schemes should plan accordingly and execute transactions on business days. Other mutual fund schemes and market operations remain unaffected.
