title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Lower Revision of Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the lower revision of Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages for 56 securities effective October 10, 2025. The revision indicates improved compliance and surveillance parameters for the affected companies, resulting in reduced surveillance restrictions. The revisions include:
- 7 securities moving from Stage 1 to Stage 0 (complete removal from GSM)
- 19 securities moving from Stage 2 to Stage 1
- 10 securities moving from Stage 3 to Stage 2
- 19 securities moving from Stage 4 to Stage 3
- 1 security moving from Stage 3 to Stage 4 (Aviva Industries Ltd)

## Key Points

- Total 56 securities affected by stage revisions
- 7 companies completely exit GSM framework (Stage 0)
- Companies span multiple groups: X, Z, B, T, XT, P, and ZP
- Lower stages indicate reduced surveillance and fewer trading restrictions
- Revisions reflect improved compliance with regulatory requirements
- One anomaly: Aviva Industries Ltd moved to higher stage (3 to 4)

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework is a surveillance measure designed to alert investors about securities with abnormal price movements or other concerning parameters. Lower stage revisions indicate:
- Improved compliance with disclosure requirements
- Better corporate governance standards
- Reduced volatility or price manipulation concerns
- Meeting of regulatory benchmarks for surveillance removal

## Compliance Requirements

**For Listed Companies:**
- Continue maintaining compliance standards that led to stage reduction
- Ensure timely disclosures and regulatory filings
- Maintain corporate governance standards
- Avoid activities that could trigger re-classification to higher GSM stages

**For Market Participants:**
- Note revised surveillance categorization for affected securities
- Adjust trading strategies based on reduced surveillance restrictions
- Monitor securities that remain in GSM framework

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 10, 2025
- No specific deadlines mentioned as this is a status update circular

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts:**
- Improved market perception for downgraded securities
- Potential increase in liquidity as surveillance restrictions ease
- Enhanced investor confidence in affected companies
- Reduced trading restrictions and additional margin requirements
- Lower compliance burden for companies exiting GSM completely

**Market Implications:**
- Stage 0 companies (7 securities) face no GSM-related trading restrictions
- Lower stages allow normal trading without additional surveillance measures
- Potential positive price impact due to improved market sentiment
- Broader market confidence in BSE's surveillance framework effectiveness

**Risk Considerations:**
- Aviva Industries Ltd moved to higher stage (3 to 4), indicating increased surveillance concerns
- Companies must maintain compliance to avoid future upward revisions
- Remaining securities in Stages 1-4 still face varying levels of surveillance
