title: TRAI Direction on Mandatory Adoption of 1600-Series Numbers for BFSI Entities
---

## Summary

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a Direction dated November 19, 2025, under section 13 of the TRAI Act, 1997, mandating phase-wise implementation of 1600-series numbers by entities regulated by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). This directive aims to curb promotional calls disguised as service and transactional calls, which often result in spam and potential scams.

## Key Points

- TRAI mandates exclusive use of 1600-series numbers for service and transactional voice calls by BFSI sector entities
- Department of Telecommunications (DoT) allocated 1600-series exclusively for Government entities and BFSI sector on December 23, 2024
- TRAI directed Access Providers to initiate allocation on December 31, 2024
- Despite awareness campaigns, adoption by BFSI entities has remained low
- Most entities continue using ten-digit mobile numbers for service and transactional calls
- Direction issued under section 13, read with sub-clauses (i) and (v) of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 11 of TRAI Act, 1997
- Based on Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018

## Regulatory Changes

TRAI has invoked regulatory powers to enforce mandatory adoption of 1600-series numbers, moving from voluntary to compulsory implementation. The directive specifically targets entities regulated by:

- Reserve Bank of India (RBI) - covering banks, NBFCs, payment systems
- Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) - covering stock exchanges, brokers, depositories, mutual funds
- Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) - covering pension funds and intermediaries

This represents a significant shift from the previous voluntary framework to mandatory compliance with phase-wise implementation timelines.

## Compliance Requirements

All RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA regulated entities must:

1. Register for and adopt 1600-series numbers for all service and transactional voice calls
2. Discontinue use of ten-digit mobile numbers for service and transactional communications
3. Comply with phase-wise implementation timelines (specific dates to be notified)
4. Register with Access Providers for allocation of 1600-series numbers
5. Ensure all commercial communications comply with Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018
6. Update customer communication systems and processes to use only registered 1600-series numbers

Failure to comply may result in suspension or disconnection of telecom resources as per existing regulations.

## Important Dates

- **December 23, 2024**: DoT decision to allocate 1600-series for Government and BFSI entities
- **December 31, 2024**: TRAI directed Access Providers to initiate allocation
- **November 19, 2025**: TRAI Direction issued for mandatory phase-wise implementation
- **Phase-wise implementation dates**: To be specified in subsequent notifications
