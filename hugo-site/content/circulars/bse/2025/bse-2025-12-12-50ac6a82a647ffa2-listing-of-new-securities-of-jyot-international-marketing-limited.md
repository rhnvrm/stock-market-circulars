## Impact Assessment

This is a routine preferential allotment listing with minimal market impact. The issuance of 4,00,000 shares represents a modest capital raise at Rs. 40/- per share (total Rs. 1.6 crore). The lock-in period until August 30, 2026 ensures these shares cannot be traded freely for approximately 9 months from the listing date, limiting immediate market supply. Impact is restricted to Jyot International Marketing Limited shareholders and does not affect broader market operations.
