---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of three securities into higher stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. Tejassvi Aaharam Limited (scrip code 531628) and Binny Mills Ltd. (scrip code 535620) are being moved to GSM Stage II, while Yaari Digital Integrated Services Ltd (scrip code 533520) is being moved to GSM Stage III. The circular notes that securities marked with special symbols may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM or IBC frameworks.

## Key Points

- Three securities are being moved to higher GSM surveillance stages
- Tejassvi Aaharam Limited (ISIN: INE173E01019) moved to GSM Stage II
- Binny Mills Ltd. (ISIN: INE160L01011) moved to GSM Stage II
- Yaari Digital Integrated Services Ltd (ISIN: INE126M01010) moved to GSM Stage III
- Securities marked (#) may move lower in GSM if included in ESM Framework
- Securities marked ($) may move lower in GSM if included in IBC Framework
- Classification is as per NSE standards

## Regulatory Changes

The movement to higher GSM stages indicates enhanced surveillance measures for the affected securities. GSM Stage II and Stage III come with progressively stricter trading restrictions, including:

- Additional surveillance on price movements
- Potential trading restrictions or limitations
- Enhanced disclosure requirements
- Increased margin requirements for trading these securities

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of the GSM stage classification for these securities
- Investors should note the enhanced surveillance applicable to these stocks
- Brokers need to inform clients about the special surveillance status
- All market participants must comply with additional trading restrictions applicable to GSM securities

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: October 30, 2025
- Effective Date: Not explicitly mentioned in the circular (typically effective immediately or from next trading day)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Securities moved to higher GSM stages typically experience reduced liquidity as additional restrictions discourage speculative trading. Stage III securities face more stringent controls than Stage II.

**Investor Impact:** Existing investors in these securities should be aware of potential liquidity constraints and increased margin requirements. New investors may face additional barriers to entry.

**Market Impact:** The movement to higher surveillance stages signals regulatory concern about volatility or unusual trading patterns in these securities, warranting increased caution from market participants.
