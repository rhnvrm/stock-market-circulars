## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - This is a significant corporate action involving one of India's largest IT companies with a buyback size of up to 10 crore shares valued at Rs. 18,000 crores at the offer price. This will likely impact Infosys stock liquidity and price during the offer period.

**Operational Impact**: Medium-High - Trading members and custodians must ensure their systems, login credentials, and investor databases are ready for the 7-day offer window. The circular provides detailed contact information for technical support across multiple systems (iBBS, RTRMS, Extranet).

**Investor Impact**: High - Eligible Infosys shareholders have the opportunity to tender their shares at Rs. 1800 per share, which represents a premium/discount depending on prevailing market prices. Multiple investor categories (institutional and retail) can participate.

**Timeline Sensitivity**: Critical - The offer opens November 20, 2025, giving members limited time to prepare systems and inform clients. The compressed 7-day window requires efficient coordination between trading members, custodians, and investors.
