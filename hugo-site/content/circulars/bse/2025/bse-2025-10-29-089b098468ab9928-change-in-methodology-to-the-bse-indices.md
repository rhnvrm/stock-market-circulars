title: Change in Methodology to the BSE Indices
---

## Summary

BSE Index Services Private Ltd has announced changes to the methodology for fast-track inclusion of newly listed companies in BSE AllCap and related Size and Sector Indices. The revised criteria expand eligibility from top 10 companies (based on one-month average) to top 200 companies (based on average total market capitalization), with a new monthly review schedule. Changes are effective December 2, 2025.

## Key Points

- Fast-track inclusion criteria expanded from top 10 to top 200 companies based on average total market capitalization
- Applies to companies listed via IPOs or spin-offs
- Companies must satisfy all eligibility and index construction criteria
- New monthly review window: companies listed between Monday following 3rd Friday of T-2 month until 3rd Friday of T-1 month
- Data evaluation period: one month ending 3rd Friday of current month
- Index addition timing: market open on Tuesday following first Monday of each month
- Previous system provided 5 days' notice; new system follows monthly schedule

## Regulatory Changes

**Previous Methodology:**
- Fast-track inclusion required IPO to be among top 10 companies based on one-month average daily total market capitalization
- Companies added with five days' notice to clients

**New Methodology:**
- Fast-track inclusion requires company to be ranked among top 200 companies based on average total market capitalization
- Eligibility checked for listings occurring between Monday following 3rd Friday of T-2 month until 3rd Friday of T-1 month
- All data points considered for one-month period ending 3rd Friday of current month
- Index additions occur at market open on Tuesday following first Monday of each month

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should adjust their index tracking and rebalancing strategies to account for the new monthly inclusion schedule
- Index fund managers need to prepare for potential constituent changes on the Tuesday following the first Monday of each month
- Companies seeking fast-track inclusion must meet all standard eligibility and index construction criteria in addition to market cap ranking

## Important Dates

- **October 29, 2025**: Announcement date
- **December 2, 2025**: Effective date for methodology changes
- **Ongoing**: Monthly review cycle with additions on Tuesday following first Monday of each month

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Broadens eligibility pool for fast-track inclusion from top 10 to top 200 companies, potentially increasing number of newly listed companies entering indices sooner
- Standardized monthly schedule provides more predictability for index rebalancing compared to ad-hoc five-day notice period
- May affect passive fund flows and index constituent trading volumes around monthly rebalancing dates

**Operational Impact:**
- Index fund managers will need to adjust operational processes to align with monthly inclusion schedule
- More transparent and systematic approach to fast-track inclusions
- Reduces urgency of implementation (monthly vs. 5-day notice) allowing better preparation

**Affected Indices:**
- BSE AllCap Index
- Related BSE Size Indices
- Related BSE Sector Indices
