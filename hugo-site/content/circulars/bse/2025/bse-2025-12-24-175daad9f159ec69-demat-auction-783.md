## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on affected brokers and clients who have failed to deliver securities. The auction will result in close-out of positions at potentially unfavorable prices for defaulting parties. Wide range of stocks affected indicates moderate delivery failures across the market. Presence of large-cap stocks like Infosys, HDFC Bank, and TCS suggests some delivery issues even in highly liquid securities, though quantities are minimal.
