- Trading members are required to take note of the record date and ex-rights trading arrangements
- Eligible shareholders holding shares as of record date will be entitled to participate in the rights issue

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: 14th November 2025
- **Ex-Rights Trading Commences**: 14th November 2025
- **Settlement Number**: DR-756/2025-2026
- **Payment Timeline**: Application amount (Rs. 5/-) on application; balance payable within 12 months from allotment date

## Impact Assessment

**For Shareholders**: Existing shareholders will have the opportunity to subscribe to additional shares at Rs. 20/- per share in the ratio of 3:19. The staggered payment option (Rs. 5/- upfront, balance within 12 months) reduces immediate capital outlay. Non-participation will result in dilution of holding percentage.

**For Trading**: Share price adjustment expected on ex-rights date to reflect the rights entitlement value. Increased trading volumes may occur as shareholders trade rights entitlements.

**For Company**: Capital raising exercise that will increase equity base and provide funds for business operations while maintaining proportional ownership for participating shareholders.
