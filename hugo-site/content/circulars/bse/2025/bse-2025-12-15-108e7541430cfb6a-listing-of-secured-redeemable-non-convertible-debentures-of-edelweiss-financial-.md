## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine debt listing that expands investment options for fixed-income investors seeking rated corporate debt securities.

**Investor Impact**: Provides investors with multiple options across different tenures and interest payment structures. The CRISIL A+/Stable rating indicates adequate safety with higher yields compared to government securities. Zero-coupon options (Series II, V, VIII) offer compounded returns for investors not requiring periodic income.

**Liquidity**: Market lot of one NCD enables retail investor participation. However, actual trading liquidity will depend on secondary market activity.

**Risk Consideration**: While secured and rated, these NCDs carry credit risk associated with Edelweiss Financial Services Limited's financial health. The A+ rating is investment grade but not the highest category.
