title: Resumption of Suspension in fresh subscriptions of Invesco Mutual Fund
---

## Summary

Invesco Mutual Fund has revoked the temporary suspension of subscriptions in three overseas fund of fund schemes that was imposed on October 9, 2025. Effective December 5, 2025, investors can resume subscriptions through lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh registrations for Systematic Investment Plans (SIP), Systematic Transfer Plans (STP), and IDCW Transfer Plans in the designated schemes. Subscriptions are subject to available headroom within overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022 at the fund level.

## Key Points

- Subscription resumption effective December 5, 2025 for three overseas fund of fund schemes
- Previous suspension was imposed on October 9, 2025
- Allowed subscription methods: lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, fresh SIP/STP/IDCW Transfer Plan registrations
- Subscriptions limited to available headroom within overseas investment limits (as of February 1, 2022)
- AMC reserves right to re-suspend subscriptions if overseas investment limits are approached
- All other terms and conditions of SIDs and KIMs remain unchanged

## Designated Schemes

The following three schemes are affected by this resumption:

1. Invesco India - Invesco Global Equity Income Fund of Fund
2. Invesco India - Invesco Pan European Equity Fund of Fund
3. Invesco India - Invesco Global Consumer Trends Fund of Fund

## Compliance Requirements

- Notice-cum-addendum forms integral part of Scheme Information Documents (SIDs) and Key Information Memorandums (KIMs)
- Fund manager: Invesco Asset Management (India) Pvt. Ltd. (CIN: U67190MH2005PTC153471)
- Investors must read all scheme-related documents carefully as mutual fund investments are subject to market risks

## Important Dates

- **October 9, 2025**: Original suspension of subscriptions imposed
- **December 3, 2025**: Notice issued
- **December 5, 2025**: Subscription resumption effective date
- **February 1, 2022**: Reference date for overseas investment limits

## Impact Assessment

This development provides relief to investors seeking exposure to overseas markets through Invesco's fund of fund offerings. However, the resumption is conditional and subject to available headroom within regulatory overseas investment limits. The AMC's right to re-suspend subscriptions creates uncertainty for long-term investment planning. Investors should monitor fund communications closely as subscriptions may be halted again if limits are approached. The measure reflects ongoing challenges faced by Indian mutual funds in managing overseas investment caps while meeting investor demand for international diversification.
