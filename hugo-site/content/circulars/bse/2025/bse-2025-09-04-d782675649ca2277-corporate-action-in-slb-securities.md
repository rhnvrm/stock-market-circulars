- 21 companies have declared dividends with various record dates in September 2025
- Bajaj Consumer Care Limited is conducting a share buyback with record date September 5, 2025
- All securities will have shut periods ranging from 2-4 days around their respective record dates
- Ex-dates generally coincide with record dates for most securities

## Corporate Actions Schedule

**Dividends:**
- September 4: Supriya Lifescience (ex-date)
- September 9: Gujarat State Fertilizers, BLS International, RBL Bank
- September 12: K.P. Energy, Mastek, KPI Green Energy, Techno Electric

**Share Buyback:**
- Bajaj Consumer Care: Record date September 5, Ex-date September 4, Foreclosure September 4

## Important Dates

- **Earliest Action**: September 4, 2025 (Bajaj Consumer Care buyback ex-date, Supriya Lifescience dividend ex-date)
- **Latest Action**: September 23, 2025 (Mold-Tek Packaging dividend)
- **Shut Periods**: Range from 2-4 days for each security around their record dates

## Impact Assessment

Moderate market impact expected as investors adjust positions before ex-dates to capture dividend entitlements. The buyback by Bajaj Consumer Care may create additional trading interest. SLB (Securities Lending and Borrowing) participants need to plan around the shut periods when securities cannot be borrowed or lent.
