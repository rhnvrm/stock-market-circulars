## Impact Assessment

**High impact on SLB market participants**: This circular directly affects securities lending and borrowing operations for three major stocks. Market participants with open SLB positions must take immediate action to close or settle positions before foreclosure. The spin-off of Hindustan Unilever is particularly significant given its large market capitalization and likely high SLB activity. Rights issue participants in Patel Engineering must ensure compliance with the record date. The short notice period (2-3 days) requires urgent attention from institutional investors, arbitrageurs, and market makers active in the SLB segment.
