## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - Demat auctions are routine settlement procedures that occur regularly. The quantities involved are relatively small compared to daily trading volumes for most scrips.

**Operational Impact**: Limited to members who have delivery shortages in the specified scrips. They must arrange funds and participate in the auction to close out their obligations.

**Investor Impact**: Minimal direct impact on retail investors. May cause temporary price volatility in smaller scrips with larger auction quantities relative to their float.
