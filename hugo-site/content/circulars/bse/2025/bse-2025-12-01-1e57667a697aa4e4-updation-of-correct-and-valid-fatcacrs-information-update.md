## Summary

BSE has postponed the implementation of revised FATCA/CRS document ID types on the BSE StAR MF platform. The changes, originally scheduled for post-market hours on December 2, 2025, will now be implemented post-market hours on December 16, 2025. This update applies to revised document ID types received from both RTAs as per Annexure II referenced in Notice No. 20251103-46 dated November 3, 2025.

## Key Points

- Implementation of revised FATCA/CRS document ID types postponed by 14 days
- New implementation date: Post-market hours on December 16, 2025
- Original implementation date: Post-market hours on December 2, 2025
- Applies to revised document ID types from both RTAs
- References Annexure II from earlier Notice No. 20251103-46 dated November 3, 2025
- Members using third-party vendor solutions or in-house trading applications must complete necessary development work

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular provides a timeline extension for implementing previously announced FATCA/CRS document ID type revisions on the BSE StAR MF platform.

## Compliance Requirements

- **All BSE Members**: Must ensure their systems are updated to support revised FATCA/CRS document ID types before December 16, 2025
- **Members with Third-Party Vendor Solutions**: Must coordinate with vendors to complete necessary system development and testing
- **Members with In-House Trading Applications**: Must initiate and complete internal development work to accommodate the revised document ID types
- Members should reference Annexure II from Notice No. 20251103-46 for specific document ID type specifications

## Important Dates

- **December 1, 2025**: Notice date announcing implementation postponement
- **December 2, 2025**: Original implementation date (now postponed)
- **December 16, 2025**: New implementation date (post-market hours)
- **Reference Date**: November 3, 2025 - Original notice (No. 20251103-46) with Annexure II specifications

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - The postponement provides members with an additional two weeks to complete system development and testing, reducing implementation risk. This affects all BSE mutual fund trading members and their technology infrastructure.

**Member Impact**: The extension benefits members who may need additional time for:
- Vendor coordination and system updates
- Internal development and testing cycles
- Quality assurance and user acceptance testing
- Staff training on revised document ID types

**Market Impact**: Low to Medium - No immediate market disruption expected. The postponement actually reduces potential operational disruptions by allowing adequate preparation time.
