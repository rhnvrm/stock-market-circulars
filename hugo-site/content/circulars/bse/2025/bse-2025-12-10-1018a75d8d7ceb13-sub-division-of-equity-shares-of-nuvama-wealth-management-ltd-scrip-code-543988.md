## Summary

BSE has notified that Nuvama Wealth Management Ltd (Scrip Code: 543988) will implement a sub-division of equity shares with a record date of December 26, 2025. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs.10/- will be split into five equity shares with a face value of Rs.2/- each. The current ISIN (INE531F01015) will become invalid for exchange transactions from the effective date, and a new ISIN for the Rs.2/- paid-up shares will be communicated separately.

## Key Points

- Company: Nuvama Wealth Management Ltd
- Scrip Code: 543988
- Sub-division ratio: 1:5 (One share of Rs.10/- into Five shares of Rs.2/-)
- Record Date: December 26, 2025
- Effective Date: December 26, 2025
- Segment: Equity - Dematerialised Securities (Rolling Settlement)
- Notice Reference: DR-785/2025-2026
- Current ISIN: INE531F01015 (Rs.10/- face value)
- Current ISIN validity: Will not be valid for transactions on or after December 26, 2025
- New ISIN: To be communicated via separate notice

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action under existing SEBI regulations governing stock sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date and effective date for the sub-division
- Systems must be updated to reflect the new face value and ISIN effective December 26, 2025
- The old ISIN (INE531F01015) must not be used for transactions on or after the effective date
- Market participants should await the separate notice announcing the new ISIN for Rs.2/- paid-up shares
- All outstanding orders and positions must be adjusted according to the 1:5 split ratio

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 10, 2025
- **Record Date**: December 26, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 26, 2025 (new sub-divided shares tradable from this date)
- **Old ISIN Last Valid Date**: December 25, 2025 (INE531F01015 not valid from December 26, 2025 onwards)

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Shareholders holding Nuvama Wealth Management Ltd shares as of the record date will receive five shares of Rs.2/- face value for every one share of Rs.10/- face value held. The total investment value remains unchanged, but liquidity may improve due to lower per-share price.

**Trading Impact**: The stock will trade at approximately one-fifth of its pre-split price from December 26, 2025. This may attract retail investors and improve trading volumes due to enhanced affordability.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems, depositories (NSDL/CDSDL), and back-office systems of brokers and custodians must be updated to handle the new ISIN and adjusted share quantities. Market participants must ensure their systems correctly process the 1:5 adjustment.

**Market Impact**: Stock sub-divisions are generally viewed positively as they improve accessibility and liquidity without changing fundamental company value or shareholder ownership percentages.
