## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing event with limited immediate market impact. The preferential allotment increases the total outstanding units of Maple Infrastructure Trust. The significant lock-in provisions (approximately 11.27% units locked until 2028 and 88.73% until 2026) will restrict immediate trading supply. The listing expands the capital base of the infrastructure trust but does not indicate any operational or regulatory changes affecting the broader market.
