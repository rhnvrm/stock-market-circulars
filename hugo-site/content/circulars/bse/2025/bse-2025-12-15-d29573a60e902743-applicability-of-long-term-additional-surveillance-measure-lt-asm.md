## Impact Assessment

The addition of 7 securities to the LT-ASM Framework will subject them to enhanced surveillance and monitoring by BSE. This measure is typically applied to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or volatility patterns. Market participants trading these securities should be aware of the additional surveillance and potential trading restrictions. The removal of Fraser and Company Ltd from LT-ASM to GSM Framework indicates a shift to a different surveillance category with its own set of requirements.
