## Compliance Requirements

  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced on/before Issue Closing Date shall lapse and be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market impact as it affects only existing shareholders of Deccan Gold Mines Limited who hold rights entitlements. The announcement follows standard BSE procedures for rights issues and renunciation trading. Shareholders can trade their rights entitlements during the specified 6-day window or participate in the rights issue directly. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis ensures transparent and timely settlement of RE transactions.
