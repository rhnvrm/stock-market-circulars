- Company: SPACE INCUBATRICS TECHNOLOGIES LTD
- Scrip Code: 541890

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN number INE797Z01028 for all trades in SPACE INCUBATRICS TECHNOLOGIES LTD equity shares executed on or after December 19, 2025

## Important Dates

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| December 08, 2025 | Original exchange notice issued (Notice No. 20251208-9) |
| December 16, 2025 | New ISIN announcement date |
| December 19, 2025 | Ex-date - New ISIN becomes effective for trading |

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by a factor of 10, potentially improving liquidity and making shares more affordable for retail investors. The new ISIN ensures proper identification and tracking of the subdivided shares.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their systems to accommodate the new ISIN and revised face value. The 10:1 split ratio is straightforward and commonly implemented. Shareholders will see their holding quantities multiplied by 10 while the total investment value remains unchanged.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares of Re.1/- face value for every 1 share of Rs.10/- face value held. This is a cosmetic change that does not affect the ownership percentage or total value of holdings but may improve marketability of the stock.
