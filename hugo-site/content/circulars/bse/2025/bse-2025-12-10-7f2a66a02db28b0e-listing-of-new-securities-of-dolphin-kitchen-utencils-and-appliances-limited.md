This is a routine listing notice with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment of 2,00,000 shares represents dilution for existing shareholders but the quantum is relatively small. The shares issued to non-promoters are subject to an 8-month lock-in period from the date of allotment, preventing immediate selling pressure. The issue was completed via warrant conversion, indicating planned capital raising executed as per schedule.
