title: Resumption of Suspension in fresh subscriptions of Invesco Mutual Fund
---

## Summary

Invesco Mutual Fund has revoked the temporary suspension of subscriptions in three overseas fund of fund schemes effective December 5, 2025. The resumption allows lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh registrations for Systematic Investment Plans (SIP), Systematic Transfer Plans (STP), and IDCW Transfer Plans. This reverses the suspension notice dated October 9, 2025. Subscriptions will be permitted only within available headroom limits without breaching overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022 at the Fund level.

## Key Points

- Temporary suspension of subscriptions revoked for three Invesco overseas fund of fund schemes
- Effective date: December 5, 2025
- Affected schemes: Invesco Global Equity Income FoF, Invesco Pan European Equity FoF, and Invesco Global Consumer Trends FoF
- Resumption covers lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh SIP/STP/IDCW Transfer Plan registrations
- Subscriptions allowed only up to available headroom without breaching overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022
- AMC reserves right to temporarily re-suspend if overseas investments approach the February 1, 2022 limits
- All other terms and conditions of SIDs and KIMs remain unchanged
- Notice cum addendum forms integral part of scheme documents

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This notice revokes a previous temporary suspension and reinstates normal subscription operations with headroom monitoring provisions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Invesco Asset Management must monitor overseas investment limits against February 1, 2022 thresholds
- AMC must suspend subscriptions temporarily if limits are approached
- Notice cum addendum must be treated as integral part of Scheme Information Documents and Key Information Memorandums
- Investors must continue reading all scheme related documents carefully before investing

## Important Dates

- **December 3, 2025**: Notice dated and signed
- **December 5, 2025**: Effective date for resumption of subscriptions
- **October 9, 2025**: Date of original suspension notice (now revoked)
- **February 1, 2022**: Reference date for overseas investment limit thresholds

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal to negligible. This is a fund-specific operational notice affecting only investors in three specific overseas fund of fund schemes of Invesco Mutual Fund.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for existing and prospective investors who wish to invest in the three designated Invesco overseas FoF schemes. Restores investment avenues that were temporarily suspended since October 9, 2025.

**Operational Impact**: Low. The AMC retains discretion to re-suspend if overseas limits are approached, creating potential uncertainty. Investors should be aware that subscriptions may be suspended again temporarily based on headroom availability.

**Fund Management Impact**: The Fund must actively monitor overseas investment limits and manage subscriptions within available headroom to comply with the February 1, 2022 regulatory threshold at Fund level.
