## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High. The demerger of a significant industrial company with immediate index inclusion across 11 major BSE indices will impact index calculations, portfolio rebalancing, and trading strategies. The Special Pre-Open Session indicates potential volatility and the need for price discovery mechanism.

**Index Impact**: SKF India (Industrial) Limited will be added to the following 11 BSE indices:
1. BSE 500
2. BSE Capital Goods
3. BSE SmallCap
4. BSE AllCap
5. BSE Industrials
6. BSE SmallCap Select Index
7. BSE 250 SmallCap Index
8. BSE 400 MidSmallCap Index
9. BSE 1000
10. BSE 1000 MultiCap Equal Size Weighted (25%)
11. BSE MidSmallCap

**Operational Impact**: Index funds and ETFs tracking these 11 indices will need to adjust their portfolios. The zero-price addition without divisor adjustment means no immediate index level impact, but future price movements will affect index values. Shareholders of SKF India Limited will receive additional shares in the new entity, requiring custody and accounting adjustments.

**Trading Impact**: The Special Pre-Open Session is designed to facilitate orderly price discovery, suggesting potential significant price movement post-demerger. Market participants should prepare for corporate action processing and potential liquidity changes.
