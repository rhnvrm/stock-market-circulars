## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and potential traders of this specific debenture series. This is a routine corporate action related to debt servicing and redemption. Debenture holders whose names appear on the record date will be eligible for interest payment and redemption proceeds. The suspension ensures orderly settlement without trading interference during the redemption process. No broader market impact expected as this affects only a single NCD series from one issuer.
