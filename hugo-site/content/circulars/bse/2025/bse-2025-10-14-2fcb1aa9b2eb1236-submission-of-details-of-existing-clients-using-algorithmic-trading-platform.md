## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Trading members will need to conduct a comprehensive audit of their algorithmic trading client base and compile detailed information including strategy types (white box vs black box) and product platforms used. This requires coordination between compliance, technology, and operations teams.

**Market Impact:** Low direct market impact, but strengthens regulatory oversight of retail algorithmic trading activities. This data collection exercise will help exchanges and SEBI monitor the extent and nature of retail participation in algorithmic trading.

**Compliance Impact:** Medium - Trading members must ensure accurate and timely submission of client data. Non-compliance could result in regulatory action. Members need to establish processes to distinguish between white box and black box strategies used by clients and track product types accurately.
