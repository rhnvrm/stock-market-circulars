## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect revised price bands
- Changes must be implemented before market opening on October 31, 2025
- All trading in these scrips must adhere to new price band limits
- Members requiring clarifications should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 30, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 31, 2025
- **Implementation Deadline:** Before market opening on October 31, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The price band revisions will directly affect trading dynamics for these 16 securities. Tighter bands (2% and 5%) indicate heightened surveillance concerns and will restrict intraday price movements, potentially reducing liquidity and volatility. Wider bands (20%) for SKF India and STAR HOUSING FINANCE suggest normalized trading conditions.

**Investor Impact:** Traders and investors in these securities must adjust their strategies to accommodate the new price limits. Day traders may find opportunities limited in securities with 2% bands, while those with 20% bands offer more trading flexibility.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure their risk management systems and order entry platforms are updated to prevent orders outside the new price bands, avoiding trade rejections and compliance issues.
