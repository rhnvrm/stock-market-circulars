## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements surveillance measures through price band adjustments. Price bands limit the maximum price movement (up or down) allowed for a security during a trading session. Tighter bands (2-5%) indicate higher surveillance concerns and restrict volatility, while wider bands (10-20%) allow greater price movement.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must implement the revised price bands in their trading systems before market opening on October 29, 2025
- **Risk Management Systems**: Update risk parameters and position limits based on new price bands
- **Client Communication**: Inform clients trading in these securities about the revised price movement limits
- **Order Management**: Ensure orders are placed within the new price band limits to avoid rejections

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 28, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 29, 2025
- **Implementation**: Before market opening on October 29, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revision of price bands will affect intraday trading dynamics for these 16 securities. Stocks with tighter bands (2-5%) will experience reduced volatility and potentially lower liquidity as price movements are constrained. This may lead to increased order rejections and wider bid-ask spreads.

**Trading Impact**: Traders and algorithms using these securities will need to adjust their strategies to account for reduced price movement limits. Day trading opportunities will be limited for securities with 2% bands, while those with 20% bands retain greater flexibility.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors holding positions in these stocks should be aware that exit or entry opportunities may be limited within a single trading session due to price band restrictions. Multi-day strategies may be required for significant position changes.

**Surveillance Context**: The varying levels of price bands suggest differentiated surveillance concerns across these securities, with the exchange implementing proportionate restrictions based on individual scrip characteristics and trading patterns.
