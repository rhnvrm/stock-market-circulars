title: SEBI Circular on Minimum Information to be Provided to Audit Committee and
  Shareholders for Approval of Related Party Transactions
---

## Summary

SEBI has modified the requirements for minimum information to be provided to Audit Committees and shareholders for approval of Related Party Transactions (RPTs). The circular introduces threshold-based relaxations, exempting certain transactions from detailed disclosure requirements based on transaction value. Transactions not exceeding 1% of annual consolidated turnover or Rs. 10 crore (whichever is lower) will have simplified disclosure requirements, while transactions below Rs. 1 crore are completely exempted from these requirements.

## Key Points

- SEBI Board approved the proposal for relaxation in minimum information requirements for RPT approvals in its 211th meeting held on September 12, 2025
- Modifications apply to Section III-B of the Master Circular and Para 7 of SEBI Circular dated June 26, 2025
- Industry Standards Forum (ISF) had requested relaxation from applicability of RPT Industry Standards
- The proposal was discussed with SEBI's Advisory Committee on Listing Obligations and Disclosures (ACLOD)
- A Consultation Paper was issued on August 04, 2025 seeking public feedback before finalizing the changes
- Changes aim to facilitate ease of doing business for listed entities

## Regulatory Changes

**Part A - Audit Committee Information Requirements:**

Listed entities must provide audit committees with information as per Industry Standards on RPT approvals. However:

1. **Threshold Exemption 1:** If a transaction (individually or taken together with previous transactions during a financial year, including ratifications) does not exceed:
   - 1% of annual consolidated turnover as per last audited financial statements, OR
   - Rs. 10 crore (whichever is lower)
   
   Then simplified disclosure as per Annexure-13A applies

2. **Threshold Exemption 2:** Transactions not exceeding Rs. 1 crore (individually or taken together with previous transactions during a financial year, including ratifications) are completely exempted from these requirements

**Part B - Shareholder Information Requirements:**

Notices to shareholders seeking RPT approval must include information as per Industry Standards in the explanatory statement, in addition to Companies Act, 2013 requirements. The same threshold exemptions apply.

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed entities must assess transaction values against specified thresholds to determine applicable disclosure requirements
- For transactions above Rs. 1 crore but within the 1%/Rs. 10 crore threshold, use simplified Annexure-13A format
- For transactions exceeding the thresholds, full Industry Standards disclosure requirements apply
- Threshold calculations must include previous transactions during the financial year, including those approved by ratification
- Listed entities must continue to comply with Companies Act, 2013 requirements for shareholder approvals

## Important Dates

- **September 12, 2025:** SEBI Board approved the proposal in its 211th meeting
- **October 13, 2025:** Circular issued
- **Effective Date:** Not explicitly stated; modifications to Master Circular and previous circular are effective immediately unless otherwise specified

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts:**
- Reduces compliance burden for listed entities, particularly for smaller RPTs
- Streamlines approval processes for routine, low-value related party transactions
- Aligns with ease of doing business objectives
- Maintains robust oversight for material transactions while simplifying requirements for immaterial ones

**Operational Impact:**
- Listed entities need to update internal processes for RPT approvals to incorporate threshold-based exemptions
- Audit committees will receive simplified information for smaller transactions, potentially improving efficiency
- Legal and compliance teams must understand and implement the new threshold calculations
- Board and audit committee policies may need revision to reflect the new framework

**Market Impact:**
- Expected to reduce administrative costs for listed entities
- May improve efficiency of corporate governance processes
- Maintains investor protection for material transactions while reducing regulatory burden for immaterial ones
