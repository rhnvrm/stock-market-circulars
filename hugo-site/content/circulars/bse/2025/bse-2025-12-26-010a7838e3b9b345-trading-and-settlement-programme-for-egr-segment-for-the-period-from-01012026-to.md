## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects all EGR segment participants including trading members, clearing members, and investors in gold receipts.

**Operational Impact**: This calendar is critical for:
- Trading members planning their EGR operations
- Clearing members managing settlement obligations
- Custodians and depositories coordinating fund and securities movements
