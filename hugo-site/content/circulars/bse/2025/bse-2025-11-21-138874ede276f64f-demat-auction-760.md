## Impact Assessment

This auction affects trading members who failed to deliver securities in the normal settlement cycle. The impact is localized to specific brokers and their clients involved in these transactions. Large quantity auctions in South Indian Bank, ZEE Learn, Sumuka Agro, Danube Industries, and Physicswalla may see price volatility during the auction process. Buyers awaiting delivery will receive their securities through the auction mechanism, though potentially at different prices than the original transaction.
