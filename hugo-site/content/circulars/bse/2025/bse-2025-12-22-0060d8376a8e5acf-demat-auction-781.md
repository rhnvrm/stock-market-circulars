## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction covers a diverse range of securities including high-value stocks like HDB Financial, Ola Electric, and Healthy Life with substantial quantities. The presence of popular retail stocks like Bajaj Auto, Bharti Airtel, Tata Motors, and ICICI Bank indicates delivery failures across various market segments.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members with delivery shortfalls face potential financial impact through auction settlement at potentially unfavorable prices. The wide range of securities (from 1 share to 8,756 shares) suggests varied delivery issues across the market.

**Investor Impact:** Investors awaiting delivery of these securities will receive them through the auction process, though timing may be delayed compared to normal settlement. Price discovery through auction mechanism may result in different settlement prices than original trade prices.
