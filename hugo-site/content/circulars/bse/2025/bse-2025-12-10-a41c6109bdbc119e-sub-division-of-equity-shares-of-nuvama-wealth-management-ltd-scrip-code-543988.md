## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The stock split increases the number of outstanding shares by a factor of 5, making the shares more affordable for retail investors. This typically increases liquidity and trading volumes. The total market capitalization remains unchanged as the reduction in face value is proportional to the increase in share count.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. The proportionate ownership and total investment value remain the same, but the per-share price will adjust to approximately one-fifth of the pre-split price.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and depositories need to update their systems to reflect the new ISIN and face value. Investors should verify their holdings post-split to ensure correct credit of subdivided shares.
