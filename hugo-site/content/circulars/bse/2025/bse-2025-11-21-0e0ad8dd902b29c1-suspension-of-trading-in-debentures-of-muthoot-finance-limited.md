## Impact Assessment

This suspension has minimal market impact as it affects only a specific series of non-convertible debentures of Muthoot Finance Limited. The suspension is temporary and procedural, required for processing the redemption and interest payment. Holders of these debentures on the record date will receive their redemption proceeds and interest payment. The suspension protects the integrity of the corporate action process by preventing trades that could create settlement issues around the record date.
