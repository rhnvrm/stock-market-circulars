## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in specific Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of Manappuram Finance Limited effective November 12, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for redemption of the debentures. Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the record date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspended for MFL-29-11-25-NCD series (ISIN: INE522D07AP4, Scrip Code: 936374)
- Record date for redemption: November 12, 2025
- No dealings permitted from November 12, 2025
- Notice issued under reference DR-754/2025-2026
- Notice issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action notification for debenture redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealings in the specified debentures from November 12, 2025
- Trading members should update their systems to prevent trades in INE522D07AP4
- Members must ensure client awareness of the trading suspension

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 3, 2025 (issued November 4, 2025)
- **Record Date**: November 12, 2025
- **No Dealings From**: November 12, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited impact confined to holders of the specific NCD series (MFL-29-11-25-NCD). The suspension is temporary and directly related to the redemption process.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders of the specified series will not be able to trade their securities from the record date. This is standard procedure for redemption and investors should have anticipated this based on the debenture terms.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and ensure compliance with the no-dealings requirement. The suspension affects only one specific debenture series of Manappuram Finance Limited, not the company's equity shares or other debt securities.
