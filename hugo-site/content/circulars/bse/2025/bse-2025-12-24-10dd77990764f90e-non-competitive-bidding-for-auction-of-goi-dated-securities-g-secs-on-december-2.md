## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational circular for G-sec auction participation through the non-competitive bidding route. The facility allows retail investors and trading members to participate in government securities auctions without competing on price. The total auction size of Rs. 32,000 crores represents standard government borrowing activity. The circular has medium impact as it provides specific operational guidelines and deadlines for market participants interested in G-sec investments. The staggered bid collection timelines for direct investors and members ensure orderly processing of bids before the RBI auction.
