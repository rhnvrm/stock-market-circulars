## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with limited market impact, affecting only holders of MONEYBOXX FINANCE LIMITED's specific debenture series (INE296Q07050). The part redemption represents a scheduled return of capital to debenture holders along with interest payment. Trading members need to ensure their systems reflect the reduced face value from the effective date to avoid settlement issues. The impact is confined to this particular debt instrument and does not have broader market implications.
