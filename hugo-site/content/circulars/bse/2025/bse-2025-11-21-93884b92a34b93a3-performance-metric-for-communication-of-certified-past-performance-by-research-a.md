title: Performance Metric for Communication of Certified Past Performance by Research
  Analysts
---

## Summary

BSE has issued guidelines on performance metrics for Research Analysts (RAs) to communicate their certified past performance to clients, following SEBI Circular HO/38/12/11(1)2025-MIRSD-POD/I/73/2025 dated October 30, 2025. RAs can now share their past performance certified by ICAI/ICMAI members with clients in one-to-one communication using specified performance metrics.

## Key Points

- Research Analysts permitted to communicate certified past performance to clients (including prospective clients) in one-to-one communication
- Performance data must be certified by a member of ICAI (Institute of Chartered Accountants of India) or ICMAI (Institute of Cost Accountants of India)
- Seven performance metrics defined for communicating past performance
- RAs may select one or more metrics from the list; disclosure of all metrics is not mandatory
- Single, consistent performance calculation methodology must be adopted for each category of advice

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has introduced a structured framework for Research Analysts to communicate their past performance through seven defined performance metrics:

1. **Absolute Returns (INR terms)** - Returns generated in INR for assumed investment amount over specified time period
2. **Absolute Returns (%)** - Returns in percentage terms for specified time period
3. **CAGR** - Compounded average annual growth rate over specified period
4. **Rolling Returns** - Returns over overlapping time periods with fixed duration measurements
5. **Hits/Misses** - Can be represented as:
   - Ratio of successful to unsuccessful calls
   - Ratio of successful to total calls
   - Number of successful calls as % of total calls
6. **Performance Charts** - Charts showing NAV or price of recommended securities with dates
7. **Range of Returns** - Maximum & minimum returns across recommendations, or categorization by performance ranges

## Compliance Requirements

- Name/nature of service/advice/recommendation
