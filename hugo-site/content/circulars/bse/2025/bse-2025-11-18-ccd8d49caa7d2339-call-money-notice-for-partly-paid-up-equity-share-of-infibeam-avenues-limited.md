## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects holders of approximately 70 crore partly paid-up equity shares of Infibeam Avenues Limited who are required to pay the outstanding call amount.

**Operational Impact:** Trading Members and SCSBs must ensure their systems are configured to access and use the Call Money Module on the IBBS platform during the 15-day issue period. Shareholders must arrange funds to meet the call money obligation of Rs. 5 per share.

**Financial Impact:** Total call money collection amounts to approximately Rs. 350 crores (69,99,85,723 shares × Rs. 5 per share), which will convert these partly paid-up shares to fully paid-up shares upon successful payment.

**Investor Action Required:** Mandatory payment by shareholders holding partly paid-up equity shares to avoid potential forfeiture of shares or loss of rights. Non-payment within the specified timeline may result in forfeiture as per the terms of the original rights issue.
