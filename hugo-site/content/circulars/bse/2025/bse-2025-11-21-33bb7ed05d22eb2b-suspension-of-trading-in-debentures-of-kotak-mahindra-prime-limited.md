## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in specific non-convertible debentures of Kotak Mahindra Prime Limited effective November 27, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for interest payment and redemption of debentures bearing ISIN INE916DA7SA6 (Code: 974426). Trading members are advised to cease dealing in these debentures from the specified date.

## Key Points

- Record date fixed for November 27, 2025
- No dealings permitted from November 27, 2025 onwards
- Purpose: Payment of interest and redemption of debentures
- Circular reference: DR-765/2025-2026

- **December 12, 2025**: Debenture maturity date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of the specific debenture series (KMPL-7.8%-12-12-25-VPT). The suspension is routine for redemption processing and will not affect equity trading or other debt instruments of Kotak Mahindra Prime Limited.

**Operational Impact**: Debenture holders with record date entitlement will receive interest payment and redemption proceeds. Trading members must ensure compliance with the no-dealing directive to avoid settlement issues.

**Investor Impact**: Existing debenture holders will be unaffected as they will receive redemption proceeds. No new positions can be established from November 27, 2025.
