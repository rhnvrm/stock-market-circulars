title: 'TRAI Direction: Mandatory Phase-wise Adoption of 1600-Series Numbers by BFSI
  Entities'
---

## Summary

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a direction dated November 19, 2025 under section 13 of the TRAI Act, 1997, mandating phase-wise implementation of 1600-series numbers by all entities regulated by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). This directive requires BFSI entities to use the dedicated 1600-series numbering exclusively for service and transactional voice calls, moving away from ten-digit mobile numbers.

## Key Points

- TRAI has mandated phase-wise adoption of 1600-series numbers for service and transactional calls by all RBI, SEBI and PFRDA regulated entities
- The 1600-series was allocated by Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on December 23, 2024 exclusively for Government entities and BFSI sector
- Despite consumer awareness campaigns, adoption of 1600-series by BFSI entities has remained low with most continuing to use ten-digit mobile numbers
- The directive is issued under Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018
- Access Providers were directed to initiate allocation of 1600-series on December 31, 2024
- The document references interactions with sector regulators RBI, PFRDA and SEBI regarding implementation

## Regulatory Changes

This direction implements mandatory compliance with the existing Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018, specifically regulation 3 which requires commercial communications to use registered headers or number resources from special series assigned for commercial communication purposes. The key change is making the use of 1600-series numbering mandatory rather than optional for all BFSI entities under RBI, SEBI and PFRDA regulation.

## Compliance Requirements

- All entities regulated by RBI, SEBI and PFRDA must adopt 1600-series numbers for service and transactional voice calls
- Entities must discontinue use of ten-digit mobile numbers for service and transactional communications
- Implementation must follow the phase-wise timeline to be specified by TRAI
- Entities must coordinate with Access Providers for allocation of 1600-series numbers
- Failure to comply may result in telecom resources being suspended or disconnected as per regulation 3(2) of the regulations

## Important Dates

- **November 19, 2025**: TRAI Direction issued
- **December 23, 2024**: DoT allocated 1600-series for Government and BFSI entities
- **December 31, 2024**: TRAI directed Access Providers to initiate 1600-series allocation
- **Phase-wise implementation dates**: To be specified in subsequent communications

## Impact Assessment

**Consumer Impact**: This directive aims to provide significant consumer protection benefits by enabling consumers to easily identify legitimate service and transactional calls from BFSI entities, reducing confusion and potential fraud. The distinct 1600-series identity will help consumers make informed decisions about call acceptance.

**Industry Impact**: All banking, financial services, insurance, securities, and pension fund entities will need to undertake significant operational changes including updating their communication infrastructure, customer awareness programs, and internal processes. This represents a major technological and procedural shift for the entire BFSI sector.

**Spam Prevention**: The measure is designed to be a major tool to curb promotional calls made in the guise of service and transactional calls, which often result in spam and potential scams. By segregating BFSI entities from other callers, it addresses a critical consumer protection issue in telecommunications.
