## Summary

BSE has revised the Market Wide Position Limits (MWPL) for stock derivatives contracts in Computer Age Management Services Limited (scrip code: 543232). The new limits will be applicable from December 05, 2025, and modify the previous circular dated December 29, 2023. This revision is pursuant to notice No. 20250919-27 dated September 19, 2025.

## Key Points

- Market Wide Limit increased to 3,71,06,075 shares
- Client/NRI/Scheme of Mutual Fund limit set at 37,10,250 shares
- Trading Member Proprietary limit set at 74,20,500 shares
- TM (Proprietary + Client)/FPI(Cat I)/MF limit set at 1,11,31,500 shares
- Limits apply to Stock Brokers, Foreign Portfolio Investors (Category I & II), and Mutual Funds
- Circular issued by ICCL (Indian Clearing Corporation Limited)

## Regulatory Changes

This circular partially modifies circular no. 20231229-46 dated December 29, 2023, updating the position limits framework for Computer Age Management Services Limited derivatives contracts. The revision follows the framework established in notice No. 20250919-27 dated September 19, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Stock Brokers must adhere to revised position limits for CAMS derivatives
- Foreign Portfolio Investors (Category I & II) must comply with new limits
- Mutual Funds must ensure their positions conform to the revised limits
- All participants must implement these limits from the effective date
- For clarifications, contact ICCL Risk Monitoring team (Ms. Dhanashri Davane at 2272 8811 or Mr. Imran Ahmed at 2272 8614)

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 04, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 05, 2025
- **Reference Notice**: September 19, 2025 (No. 20250919-27)
- **Modified Circular**: December 29, 2023 (No. 20231229-46)

## Impact Assessment

The revised position limits for CAMS derivatives will impact trading strategies and risk management for market participants holding positions in this security. The increased market-wide limit of 3.71 crore shares provides greater capacity for derivatives trading. Stock brokers, FPIs, and mutual funds trading CAMS derivatives must adjust their position monitoring systems to reflect the new limits. The revision suggests increased liquidity or market interest in CAMS derivatives, allowing for higher aggregate positions across market participants.
