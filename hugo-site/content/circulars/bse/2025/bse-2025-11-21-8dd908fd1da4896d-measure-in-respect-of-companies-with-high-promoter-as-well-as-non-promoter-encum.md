## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of B. L. Kashyap and Sons Ltd to the high encumbrance framework may impact investor confidence and trading activity in the security. Securities under this framework typically experience increased scrutiny from market participants and may face liquidity constraints.

**Operational Impact**: The company will be subject to enhanced monitoring and surveillance measures by the exchange. Trading members and investors need to be aware of the elevated risk profile associated with high promoter and non-promoter encumbrance levels.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or considering positions in any of the six securities listed should be aware of the heightened encumbrance risk and factor this into their investment decisions. The framework serves as an early warning indicator of potential financial stress or governance concerns.
