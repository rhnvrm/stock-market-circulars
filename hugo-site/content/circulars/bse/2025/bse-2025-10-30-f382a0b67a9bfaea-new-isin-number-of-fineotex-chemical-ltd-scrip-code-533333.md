title: New ISIN Number for Fineotex Chemical Ltd - Sub-Division of Equity Shares
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a new ISIN number INE045J01034 for Fineotex Chemical Ltd (Scrip Code: 533333) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value Rs.2/- to Re.1/-. This change is effective for trades executed on and from October 31, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN: INE045J01034 (replacing previous ISIN)
- Company: Fineotex Chemical Ltd
- Scrip Code: 533333
- Share sub-division ratio: Rs.2/- to Re.1/- (1:2 split)
- Effective date: October 31, 2025 (Ex-Date)
- Depository Receipt: DR-747/2025-2026
- Continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251029-5 dated October 29, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action where the company has sub-divided its equity shares, requiring issuance of a new ISIN number to distinguish the new face value shares from the old ones.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN INE045J01034 for all trades in Fineotex Chemical Ltd equity shares from October 31, 2025 onwards
- Systems must be updated to reflect the new face value of Re.1/- per share
- All post-trade processing, settlement, and reporting must use the new ISIN for trades executed on or after the ex-date

## Important Dates

- **October 29, 2025**: Original Exchange Notice No. 20251029-5 issued
- **October 30, 2025**: New ISIN notification issued
- **October 31, 2025**: Ex-Date - New ISIN becomes effective for trading

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division will double the number of outstanding shares while halving the share price, making the stock more accessible to retail investors. This is a neutral event from a valuation perspective but may increase liquidity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems, depositories, and broker platforms must be updated with the new ISIN. The timing is clear (ex-date October 31, 2025), allowing adequate preparation time.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their shareholding doubled with proportionate reduction in per-share price. No action required from investors as the change is automatic through depository systems.
