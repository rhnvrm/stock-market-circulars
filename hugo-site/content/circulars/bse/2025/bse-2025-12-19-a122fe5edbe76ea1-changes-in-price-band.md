## Regulatory Changes

The price band mechanism is a surveillance measure that limits the maximum price movement (up or down) allowed in a single trading session. Tighter bands (lower percentages) indicate higher surveillance and restricted volatility, while wider bands (higher percentages) allow more price movement within regulatory oversight.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure their systems reflect updated price bands from December 22, 2025
- All trades in affected scrips must comply with new band limits
- Members should communicate changes to clients trading in these securities
- Trading systems must reject orders outside the revised price band limits

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 19, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 22, 2025 (revised price bands become applicable)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revised price bands will affect intraday volatility and trading patterns in 37 securities. Tighter bands (1%-5%) on 20 securities will limit price swings and potentially reduce speculative activity. Stocks like SER Industries with 1% band face severe trading restrictions, while those with 20% bands maintain relatively normal trading flexibility.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in these securities may experience reduced liquidity and limited ability to enter/exit positions at desired prices, particularly in scrips with tighter bands. Day traders and short-term speculators will be most affected.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers must update risk management systems and inform clients about trading limitations in these securities to avoid order rejections.
