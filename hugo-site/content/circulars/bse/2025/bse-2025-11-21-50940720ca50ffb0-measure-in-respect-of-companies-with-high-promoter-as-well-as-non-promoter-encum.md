## Summary

BSE has issued a circular regarding the surveillance measure for companies with high Promoter as well as non-Promoter 'Encumbrance' as per Regulation 28(3) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulation 2011. Effective November 24, 2025, B. L. Kashyap and Sons Ltd (Scrip Code: 532719, ISIN: INE350H01032) has been added to this surveillance framework. No securities are being removed from the framework. The consolidated list now contains 6 securities under this measure.

## Key Points

- Framework monitors companies with high promoter and non-promoter pledge levels
- Consolidated list includes 6 securities total under this measure
- Securities can move out if included in other frameworks (LT ASM, ESM, or TT)

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements SEBI (SAST) Regulation 2011, Regulation 28(3), which requires monitoring of companies where significant shareholding (promoter or non-promoter) is encumbered or pledged. The surveillance measure is designed to protect investor interests when high levels of share encumbrance exist, as this can indicate financial stress or increased risk.

- Trading members and investors should exercise appropriate caution when dealing with securities under this measure
- Companies under this framework may face additional disclosure and monitoring requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 24, 2025 - B. L. Kashyap and Sons Ltd enters the high encumbrance surveillance framework
- **Circular Date**: November 21, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The addition of B. L. Kashyap and Sons Ltd to the high encumbrance framework signals regulatory concern about the level of pledged shares in the company. This measure:

- May impact liquidity and trading volumes in the affected security
- Serves as a risk indicator for investors regarding high pledge levels
- Could lead to increased volatility or cautious investor sentiment
- May result in stricter margin requirements or trading restrictions
- Reflects BSE's proactive risk management approach

**Consolidated Securities List**: The framework now monitors 6 securities: B. L. Kashyap and Sons Ltd, Brahmaputra Infrastructure Ltd, India Finsec Ltd, India Nivesh Ltd, NR Agarwal Industries Ltd, and Sudal Industries Ltd.

**Exit Criteria**: Securities can move out of this framework if they are included in other surveillance measures such as Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT ASM), Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM), or Trade-to-Trade (TT) framework.
