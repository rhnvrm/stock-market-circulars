## Summary

BSE has issued an update on securities subject to Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective December 12, 2025. The circular includes new securities being added to LT-ASM, securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages, securities moving out of the framework, and a consolidated list of all securities currently under LT-ASM across various stages (I, II, and IV).

## Key Points

- 2 new securities shortlisted in LT-ASM Framework: Alps Industries Ltd and Raconteur Global Resources Ltd
- 2 securities moving to higher Stage II ASM: Dhyaani Tradeventtures Ltd and Droneacharya Aerial Innovations Ltd
- 1 security (CIAN Agro Industries & Infrastructure Ltd) directly placed in Stage IV LT-ASM
- No securities moving to lower ASM stages or exiting the framework
- Consolidated list includes 14+ securities across different ASM stages
- Changes effective from December 12, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework is applied to securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or unusual trading patterns over an extended period. Securities in this framework face:

- Enhanced surveillance and monitoring
- Stricter price bands and circuit filters
- Additional disclosure requirements for trading members
- Graded restrictions based on ASM stage (I, II, III, or IV)
- Potential restrictions on derivative contracts

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure awareness of LT-ASM status before executing trades
- Enhanced due diligence required for client orders in LT-ASM securities
- Additional margin requirements may apply based on ASM stage
- Brokers must comply with specific disclosure norms for LT-ASM securities
- Clients should be informed about the surveillance classification

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 12, 2025 - All LT-ASM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Securities under LT-ASM face reduced liquidity due to stricter trading conditions and investor caution. The framework aims to protect investors from excessive speculation while maintaining market integrity.

**Trading Impact**: Stage-wise restrictions limit trading activity, with higher stages facing more stringent controls. Stage IV represents the most severe category with maximum restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors must exercise additional caution when trading LT-ASM securities. Higher transaction costs and reduced liquidity may affect investment decisions.

**Affected Companies**: The 5 newly affected/moved companies will experience heightened scrutiny, potential reputation concerns, and challenges in attracting investors until fundamentals improve and they exit the framework.
