## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the reduced face value effective December 16, 2025
- All trading in the affected debentures must reflect the new face value of Rs. 99,375 from the effective date
- Debenture holders on record as of December 16, 2025 will receive interest payment and part redemption proceeds

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: December 16, 2025
- **Effective Date for Reduced Face Value**: December 16, 2025
- **Settlement Number**: DR-778/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

The part redemption reduces the face value of each debenture by Rs. 625 (from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 99,375), representing a 0.625% redemption. This impacts holders of both debenture series equally. Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new face value to ensure accurate pricing and settlement. The impact is limited to debt segment participants and holders of these specific INTERISE TRUST debenture series.
