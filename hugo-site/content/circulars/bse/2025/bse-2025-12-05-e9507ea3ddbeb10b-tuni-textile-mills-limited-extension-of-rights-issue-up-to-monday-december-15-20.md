## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Shareholders:** Existing shareholders have an additional seven days to decide on and exercise their rights entitlements, potentially improving participation rates in the Rights Issue.

**Market Impact:** Minimal market disruption as this is a timeline extension rather than a material change to offer terms. The extension may indicate lower-than-expected initial subscription levels or company's intention to maximize shareholder participation.

**Operational Impact:** Post-issue activities including allotment, credit, and listing have been rescheduled accordingly but maintain the same relative timeline. All subsequent dates have shifted by approximately one week to accommodate the extension.
