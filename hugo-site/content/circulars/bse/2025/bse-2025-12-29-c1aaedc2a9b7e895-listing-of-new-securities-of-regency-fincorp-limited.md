## Impact Assessment

This is a company-specific listing event with minimal market-wide impact. The preferential allotment increases the total share capital of Regency Fincorp Limited. The lock-in periods ensure that a significant portion of the newly issued shares cannot be traded until mid-2026 and mid-2027, which may limit short-term liquidity impact. Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect from the new issuance.
