## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects 87 scrips with varying quantities. While demat auctions are routine, they indicate delivery failures in the settlement system.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Brokers and clearing members with positions in these scrips need to participate in the auction mechanism, potentially at prices different from the original transaction.

**Investor Impact**: Low to Medium - Investors whose transactions are part of this auction may experience delays in receiving securities or may need to settle at auction prices rather than original transaction prices.

**Notable Stocks Affected**: Major companies like Adani Power, Bank of Baroda, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Dr. Reddy's Labs, JSW Energy, and Vodafone Idea are included, though most quantities are relatively small compared to their typical trading volumes.
