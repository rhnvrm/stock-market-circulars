- Record Date: January 2, 2026
- No Dealings From: January 2, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of the specific NCD series (KFL-8.75%-17-1-26-NCD). This is a routine corporate action where the company is redeeming debentures and making interest payments to bondholders as of the record date. Trading suspension ensures clarity on eligible debenture holders. No broader market impact expected as this affects only one specific debt instrument of Kosamattam Finance Limited.
