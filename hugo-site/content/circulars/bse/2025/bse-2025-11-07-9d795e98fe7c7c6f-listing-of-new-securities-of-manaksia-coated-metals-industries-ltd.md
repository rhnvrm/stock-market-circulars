## Compliance Requirements

- All 11,82,500 shares are subject to lock-in restrictions until May 30, 2026
- Trading permitted from November 10, 2025

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** July 4, 2025

- **Lock-in Expiry Date:** May 30, 2026
- **Notice Date:** November 7, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - The listing involves a relatively small number of shares (11.825 lakh) issued on a preferential basis to non-promoters. The shares are subject to lock-in until May 30, 2026, which prevents immediate trading and limits short-term market impact.

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal immediate impact due to lock-in restrictions. Post lock-in expiry (May 2026), there will be a marginal increase in tradable float.

**Investor Impact:** Relevant only for existing shareholders and warrant holders of Manaksia Coated Metals & Industries Ltd. The preferential allotment dilutes existing shareholding proportionally.
