- **Lock-in Release Date**: February 1, 2027 (for 19,83,332 shares)

## Impact Assessment

**For Existing Shareholders**: Highly dilutive impact as existing public shareholders' holdings were reduced from face value of Rs. 10/- to Rs. 0.10/- and then consolidated, representing approximately 90% reduction in capital value. Promoter holdings were completely extinguished.

**For Resolution Applicant**: Gains controlling stake through preferential allotment of 26,90,723 shares (approximately 94.97% of post-restructuring capital).

**Market Impact**: Limited broader market impact as the company will trade in restricted XT Group and Trade-to-Trade segment, indicating higher risk profile. The listing provides an exit opportunity for resolution and marks the company's emergence from insolvency proceedings.

**Trading Implications**: Trade-to-Trade segment classification requires delivery-based trading with no intraday squaring off, limiting liquidity and speculative activity.
