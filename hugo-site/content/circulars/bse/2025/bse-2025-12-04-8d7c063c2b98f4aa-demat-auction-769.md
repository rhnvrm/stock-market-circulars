## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction involves 94 different securities with varied quantities. While this is a routine settlement mechanism, it indicates delivery failures across multiple scrips that need to be rectified through auction.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Affects brokers and trading members who have outstanding obligations in these securities. They must arrange for funds and participate in the auction to complete settlement.

**Member Impact:** Members with short delivery positions in any of the 94 listed scrips will face potential buy-in through auction, which may result in price differences and associated costs.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Individual investors whose brokers have failed to deliver may experience delayed settlement, though the auction mechanism ensures eventual delivery of securities.
