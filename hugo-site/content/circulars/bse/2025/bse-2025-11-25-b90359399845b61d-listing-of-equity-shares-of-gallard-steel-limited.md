## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - New listing adds liquidity to the steel sector on BSE. The phased unlocking of promoter shares over three years ensures controlled supply in the market.

**Trading Impact:** Immediate tradability limited to 1,791,000 free IPO shares (18.85% of total issue). Full float will increase gradually as lock-in periods expire.

**Investor Consideration:** Investors should be aware of the lock-in schedule which affects available free float. The majority of shares (73.68%) are under promoter lock-in, indicating strong promoter commitment but limited initial liquidity.
