title: Revision of Scrips in Trade to Trade Segment
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the list of securities subject to trade-to-trade settlement under surveillance measures. A total of 33 scrips have been transferred to or continue in the T/XT Group (main board), and 12 scrips have been transferred to or continue in the MT/TS Group (SME segment). Securities in trade-to-trade groups do not permit intraday trading and require compulsory delivery-based settlement.

## Key Points

- 33 securities transferred to/continuing in T/XT Group for main board
- 12 securities transferred to/continuing in MT/TS Group for SME segment
- Scrips classified under various review categories: A (abnormal price movements), B (high volatility), C (corporate action issues), and D (other surveillance concerns)
- Includes scrips from Group B, X, M, and MS based on their trading characteristics
- Two scrips (Borana Weaves Ltd and Haleos Labs Ltd) are commonly listed but satisfy criteria only at NSE

## Regulatory Changes

Securities moved to trade-to-trade groups are subject to enhanced surveillance measures:

- No intraday trading permitted
- All trades must result in delivery
- Price bands and position limits as applicable
- Increased monitoring for market integrity

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Update client communications regarding trade-to-trade restrictions on affected scrips
- Ensure all orders in these scrips are marked for delivery
- Block intraday trading facilities for these securities

**For Investors:**
- Cannot square off positions intraday
- Must take/give delivery of shares purchased/sold
- Pay-in and pay-out obligations as per normal settlement cycle

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: As per BSE circular dated November 27, 2025
- Implementation: Immediate upon circular issuance

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Reduced liquidity in affected scrips due to absence of intraday trading
- Potential widening of bid-ask spreads
- Decreased trading volumes expected

**Investor Impact:**
- Intraday traders cannot trade these scrips
- Delivery-based investors can continue normal trading
- Increased capital requirement as full payment needed upfront
- Enhanced investor protection through delivery-based settlement

**Operational Impact:**
