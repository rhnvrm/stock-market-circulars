  - REs can be renounced before the issue closes
  - REs that are neither subscribed nor renounced by the Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished
- Refer to previous notices (20200305-21 and 20200518-34) for detailed procedures

## Important Dates

| Date | Event |

| November 17, 2025 | Rights Entitlements trading ends |
| November 21, 2025 | Rights Issue closes; last date to subscribe or renounce REs |

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a company-specific rights issue affecting only DARSHAN ORNA LIMITED shareholders and potential investors.

**Operational Impact:** Medium for shareholders - Existing shareholders must decide whether to exercise their rights, renounce them for trading, or allow them to lapse. The short trading window (5 days) and brief issue period (9 days) require prompt action.

**Trading Impact:** The T+1 settlement on trade-for-trade basis ensures quick settlement while preventing speculative trading. Demat-only requirement ensures transparency and reduces settlement risk.
