## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The listing of over 40 crore equity shares represents a significant IPO. The staggered lock-in periods will control share supply in the market over the next 18 months, potentially reducing volatility. The public float of 6.34 crore shares (approximately 15.7% of total) provides immediate liquidity.

**Investor Impact**: Investors should note the varying lock-in schedules. Anchor investors face relatively short lock-ins (30-90 days), while other categories face extended periods up to 18 months. The capital reduction history (56.36 crore shares cancelled) indicates significant corporate restructuring prior to listing.

**Company Background**: Tenneco Clean Air India Limited, based in Tamil Nadu, operates in automotive components manufacturing (CIN: U29308TN2018FLC126510). The company underwent conversion from private to public limited company and executed substantial capital reduction before this listing.
