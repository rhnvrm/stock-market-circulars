## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The bulletin affects shareholders of two listed equity companies and multiple NCD holders. The dividend announcements are material for investors in Amara Raja Energy & Mobility (high dividend rate of 540%) and Astral Limited.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding these securities must ensure their holdings are reflected in demat accounts before record dates. Those purchasing after the ex-date will not be eligible for declared dividends or interest payments.

**Operational Impact:** Stock exchanges will implement trading suspensions where indicated, and depositories will generate beneficiary lists as of record dates for corporate action processing.

**Financial Impact:** Significant cash outflows for companies making dividend payments and NCD issuers redeeming/paying interest on debt securities. Amara Raja's high dividend rate indicates strong cash position and shareholder-friendly policy.
