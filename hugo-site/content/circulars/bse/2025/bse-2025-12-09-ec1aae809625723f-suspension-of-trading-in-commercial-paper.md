## Impact Assessment

The suspension affects commercial paper trading across multiple sectors including financial services, telecommunications, infrastructure, and consumer businesses.

Investors holding these commercial papers should prepare for redemption settlements. The temporary nature of these suspensions limits broader market impact, though liquidity in these specific instruments will be affected during the suspension period.
