title: Change in Methodology to the BSE Indices - Fast-Track IPO Inclusion Criteria
  Updated
---

## Summary

BSE Index Services Private Ltd has announced changes to the methodology for fast-track inclusion of IPOs and spin-offs in BSE AllCap and related Size and Sector Indices. The revised criteria expand eligibility from top 10 to top 200 companies based on market capitalization and introduce a new monthly review schedule. Changes are effective December 2, 2025.

## Key Points

- Fast-track IPO inclusion criteria expanded from top 10 to top 200 companies by average total market capitalization
- New monthly evaluation window introduced for companies listed between Monday after 3rd Friday of T-2 month until 3rd Friday of T-1 month
- Data points considered for one-month period ending 3rd Friday of current month
- Eligible companies added at market open on Tuesday following first Monday of each month
- All existing eligibility criteria under "Eligibility Criteria and Index Construction" must still be satisfied
- Applies to BSE AllCap and related Size Indices and Sector Indices

## Regulatory Changes

**Previous Methodology:**
- Fast-tracked IPOs required ranking among top 10 companies based on one-month average daily total market capitalization
- Companies added with five days' notice to clients

**New Methodology:**
- Fast-track inclusion requires ranking among top 200 companies based on average total market capitalization
- Structured monthly review cycle with specific eligibility window
- Companies listed between Monday following 3rd Friday of T-2 month until 3rd Friday of T-1 month evaluated for eligibility
- Index additions occur at market open on Tuesday following first Monday of each month

## Compliance Requirements

- Index users and market participants should prepare for the new methodology effective December 2, 2025
- Portfolio managers and index fund managers need to adjust rebalancing schedules to align with new monthly addition timing
- For queries, stakeholders should contact bseindex@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 29, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 2, 2025
- **Index Addition Schedule:** Market open on Tuesday following first Monday of each month (ongoing)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Broader pool of newly listed companies (top 200 vs top 10) can qualify for fast-track inclusion, potentially increasing index turnover
- More predictable inclusion schedule with monthly additions provides better visibility for passive fund managers
- One-month evaluation period (vs previous criteria) may result in slightly delayed inclusions but more stable selection

**Operational Impact:**
- Index fund managers will need to adjust tracking procedures to accommodate expanded eligibility universe
- Monthly addition cycle provides structured rebalancing schedule versus ad-hoc five-day notice period
- Enhanced accessibility for mid-sized IPOs and spin-offs to enter major BSE indices
