- Multiple SaaS service entries can be added in a single submission
- Submitted reports can be viewed through SAAS > View SAAS Report section

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**

1. **Login Requirements:** Access BEFS portal using Microsoft Edge browser only
2. **Submission Process:** Navigate to SaaS > Submission section
3. **Declaration:** Select submission period and indicate SaaS usage (Yes/No)
4. **If Using SaaS Services:**

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading Members need to ensure they have the correct technical setup (Microsoft Edge browser, Excel 2007+) and follow the prescribed submission workflow.

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a procedural compliance requirement with no direct market trading implications.

**Technology Impact:** Trading firms using SaaS solutions must maintain accurate records of their service providers and be prepared to report quarterly through the BEFS system. The browser restriction to Microsoft Edge may require adjustments to current workflows.
