## Impact Assessment

This part redemption will return capital to debenture holders while reducing the outstanding face value of the instruments. The substantial reduction in face values (especially for Series 2 and 3 down to Rs. 3.60) indicates significant partial redemption. Debenture holders will receive both interest payments and partial principal repayment. Trading Members need to ensure their systems are updated to reflect the new face values to maintain accurate pricing and settlement.
