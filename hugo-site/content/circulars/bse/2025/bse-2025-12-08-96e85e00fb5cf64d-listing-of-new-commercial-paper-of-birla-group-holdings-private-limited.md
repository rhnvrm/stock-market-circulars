## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing of short-term commercial paper for a private placement, affecting only institutional investors who participated in the issuance.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to institutional investors holding these instruments. The high credit ratings (A1+ from both CRISIL and ICRA) indicate strong creditworthiness and low default risk.

**Liquidity**: Trading in standard lots of Rs. 5 lakhs restricts participation to institutional and high-net-worth investors. Secondary market liquidity for commercial paper is typically limited given the short tenure.

**Operational Impact**: No operational changes for regular equity market participants. Only debt segment traders dealing in commercial paper need to note the new scrip details.
