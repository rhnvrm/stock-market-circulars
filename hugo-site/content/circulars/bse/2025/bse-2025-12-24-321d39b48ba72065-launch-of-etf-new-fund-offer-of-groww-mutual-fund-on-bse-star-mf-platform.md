**Operational Impact**: Low impact on BSE StAR MF Platform members who will need to process subscriptions according to specified timelines. Standard NFO processing requirements apply with clear deadlines for fund transfers and transaction management.

**Investor Impact**: Provides new investment avenue for investors seeking exposure to NIFTY Chemicals index through an ETF structure with both regular and direct plan options.
