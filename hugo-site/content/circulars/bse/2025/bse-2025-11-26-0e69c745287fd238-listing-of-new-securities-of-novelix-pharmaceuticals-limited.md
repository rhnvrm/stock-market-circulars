## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|-------|------|
| Allotment Date | August 14, 2025 |
| Trading Commencement | November 27, 2025 |
| Lock-in Expiry (6,45,000 shares - Dist. Nos. 13835001 to 14480000) | June 30, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - The preferential allotment represents a modest capital raise through warrant conversion. The staggered lock-in periods (58.25% locked until June 2027 and 41.75% until June 2026) will limit immediate selling pressure.

**Shareholder Impact**: The shares rank pari-passu with existing equity, providing equal voting and dividend rights. Existing shareholders will experience dilution from the 15.45 lakh new shares.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact on free float as all shares are subject to lock-in restrictions for at least 7-19 months from the trading commencement date.
