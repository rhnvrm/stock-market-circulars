title: GSM Framework - Securities Moving to Different GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update on securities moving between different stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) Framework. Three securities are being moved: two securities (Mediaone Global Entertainment and Bcl Enterprises Limited) are moving to GSM Stage I, while one security (Lynx Machinery & Commercials Limited) is moving to GSM Stage IV.

## Key Points

- Total of 3 securities affected by GSM stage changes
- Mediaone Global Entertainment (Security Code: 503685, ISIN: INE828I01019) - moved to GSM Stage I
- Bcl Enterprises Limited (Security Code: 539621, ISIN: INE368E01023) - moved to GSM Stage I
- Lynx Machinery & Commercials Limited (Security Code: 505320, ISIN: INE732D01014) - moved to GSM Stage IV
- Securities marked with (#) can move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM Framework
- Securities marked with ($) can move to lower GSM stages if included in IBC Framework

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This circular implements existing GSM Framework provisions for moving securities between surveillance stages based on market conditions and trading patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of the GSM stage applicable to these securities
- Trading in these securities will be subject to restrictions applicable to their respective GSM stages
- Higher GSM stages (Stage IV) typically involve stricter trading restrictions compared to lower stages (Stage I)

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: December 31, 2025
- Effective date for GSM stage changes not explicitly mentioned in the circular

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Securities in higher GSM stages face additional surveillance measures including potential price bands, trade-for-trade settlement, and additional margin requirements. Lynx Machinery moving to Stage IV will face more stringent restrictions, while Mediaone Global Entertainment and Bcl Enterprises moving to Stage I will have relatively lighter surveillance measures.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of the applicable GSM stage restrictions which may affect liquidity and trading flexibility.

**Market Impact:** Limited overall market impact as only 3 securities are affected, though individual stock liquidity may be impacted based on the applicable GSM stage restrictions.
