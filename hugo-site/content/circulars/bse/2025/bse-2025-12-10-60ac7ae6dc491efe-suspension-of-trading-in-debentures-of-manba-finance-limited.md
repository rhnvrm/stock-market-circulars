The suspension is due to the company setting a record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the specified date.

## Impact Assessment

The suspension impacts holders and potential traders of MANBA FINANCE LIMITED's 12.6% Non-Convertible Debentures maturing on December 27, 2025. The suspension is temporary and procedural in nature, related to the redemption process. Debenture holders will receive their redemption proceeds and final interest payment as per the terms. Trading liquidity for this instrument is eliminated from December 12, 2025, though the maturity date (December 27, 2025) suggests the suspension period is short. Limited broader market impact as this affects a specific privately placed debt instrument.
