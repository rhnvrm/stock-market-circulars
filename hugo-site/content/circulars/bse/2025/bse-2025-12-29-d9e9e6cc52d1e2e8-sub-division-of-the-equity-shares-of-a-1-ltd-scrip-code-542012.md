## Summary

A-1 Ltd (Scrip Code: 542012) has announced a subdivision of its equity shares in the ratio of 1:10. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs.10 will be subdivided into ten equity shares with a face value of Re.1 each. The record date for this corporate action is January 8, 2026, and the subdivision will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Company: A-1 Ltd (Scrip Code: 542012)
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Subdivision Ratio: 1:10 (One share of Rs.10 splits into ten shares of Re.1)
- Existing Face Value: Rs.10 per equity share
- New Face Value: Re.1 per equity share
- Record Date: January 8, 2026
- Effective Date: January 8, 2026
- Notice Reference: DR-794/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action permitted under company law where existing shares are subdivided into smaller denominations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that the existing ISIN No. INE911Z01017 (Rs.10 paid-up) will not be valid for transactions on or after January 8, 2026
- A new ISIN number for Re.1 paid-up shares will be communicated through a separate notice
- All transactions post-record date must use the new ISIN
- Demat accounts will be automatically updated with the subdivided shares

## Important Dates

- **December 29, 2025**: Circular announcement date
- **January 8, 2026**: Record date for subdivision
- **January 8, 2026**: Effective date - old ISIN becomes invalid, new face value takes effect

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: All existing shareholders will receive 10 equity shares of Re.1 face value for every 1 share of Rs.10 face value held. Total investment value remains unchanged.

**Trading Impact**: Post-subdivision, the stock price is expected to adjust proportionally (approximately 1/10th of pre-split price). Increased number of shares may improve liquidity and affordability for retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Demat accounts will be credited with subdivided shares automatically. The old ISIN will cease to be valid from January 8, 2026, and all subsequent trading must occur using the new ISIN (to be announced separately).
