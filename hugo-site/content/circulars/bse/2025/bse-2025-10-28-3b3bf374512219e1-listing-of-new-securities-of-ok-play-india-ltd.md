## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 28, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date:** October 29, 2025 (Wednesday)
- **First Allotment Date:** January 9, 2025
- **Second Allotment Date:** June 27, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry:** April 30, 2026 (for all 1,00,00,000 shares)

## Impact Assessment

This is a company-specific listing event with limited market-wide impact. The listing of 1 crore equity shares through warrant conversion increases the tradable float of OK Play India Ltd, though all shares are subject to lock-in until April 30, 2026. The preferential allotment to non-promoters may indicate capital raising activities by the company. The lock-in period restricts immediate liquidity impact on the stock.
