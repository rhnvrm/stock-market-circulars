title: Discontinuation of Weekly Trading for Neogem India Ltd in Z Group
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the discontinuation of weekly trading facility for Neogem India Ltd (scrip code 526195) effective December 9, 2025. The company had been suspended for non-compliance with SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, and was subsequently allowed limited trading on a Trade for Trade basis in Z group only on the first trading day of each week. This six-month transitional period, mandated under SEBI's Standard Operating Procedure for suspension, has now been completed.

## Key Points

- Neogem India Ltd (scrip code 526195) will no longer have weekly trading facility from December 9, 2025
- The company was initially suspended on April 21, 2025 for SEBI LODR non-compliance
- Trading was permitted on Trade for Trade basis in Z group on first trading day of every week for six months
- Discontinuation follows completion of the mandated six-month period under SEBI Master Circular dated November 11, 2024
- This action is pursuant to Chapter-VII(A) regarding Penal Actions for Non-Compliance

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements the final stage of existing SEBI Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for suspension and revocation of equity shares as outlined in SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024.

## Compliance Requirements

Market participants should note:
- Trading in Neogem India Ltd shares will not be permitted from December 9, 2025 onwards
- No weekly trading window will be available after this date
- Queries may be directed to bse.soplodr@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **April 21, 2025**: Initial suspension notice issued (Notice No. 20250421-22)
- **November 21, 2025**: Discontinuation notice issued
- **December 9, 2025**: Effective date for discontinuation of weekly trading facility

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to Neogem India Ltd and its existing shareholders. As the company was already under severe trading restrictions (Trade for Trade basis, Z group classification, weekly trading only), the discontinuation represents a procedural step in the enforcement process rather than a sudden market disruption. No broader market impact is anticipated. Shareholders seeking liquidity will need to await company compliance with SEBI LODR requirements for potential revocation of suspension.
