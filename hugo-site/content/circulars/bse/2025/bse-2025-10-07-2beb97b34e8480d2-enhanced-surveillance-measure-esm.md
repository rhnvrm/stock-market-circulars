title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Updates Effective October 08, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has updated its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework effective October 08, 2025. Four securities are being newly added to ESM Stage I, three securities are being moved to higher ESM stages, and no securities are being removed from the framework. The consolidated list now includes 27+ securities under various ESM stages.

## Key Points

- 4 new securities added to ESM Framework (Stage I): AAA Technologies Ltd, Chandrima Mercantiles Ltd, GSB Finance Ltd, and Sigma Solve Ltd
- 3 securities moved to higher ESM stages: Hi-Klass Trading and Investment Ltd, Omansh Enterprises Ltd, and Valiant Communications Ltd
- No securities moved to lower ESM stages
- No securities removed from ESM Framework
- Consolidated list includes securities across ESM Stage I and Stage II
- Changes apply to both Main Board and SME securities

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM Framework continues to apply enhanced surveillance and trading restrictions on identified securities. Securities in higher ESM stages face more stringent surveillance measures including:

- Additional disclosure requirements
- Price bands and trading restrictions
- Increased margin requirements for trades
- Mandatory delivery-based trading in some cases

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors must be aware of ESM applicability before trading in listed securities
- Trading members must ensure compliance with ESM-specific margin and trading requirements
- Securities under ESM may have different settlement and delivery obligations
- Market participants should review the consolidated list for complete ESM coverage

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 08, 2025 - All ESM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 4 securities and upgrade of 3 securities to higher surveillance stages indicates continued regulatory focus on market integrity. Investors in these securities should expect:

- Increased trading costs due to higher margins
- Reduced liquidity in some cases
- Enhanced scrutiny of price movements
- Potential impact on short-term trading strategies

The absence of any securities exiting ESM suggests sustained concerns about the listed companies' trading patterns or compliance status.
