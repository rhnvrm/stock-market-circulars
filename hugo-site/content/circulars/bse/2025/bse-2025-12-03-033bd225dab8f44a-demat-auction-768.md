## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects multiple securities but represents routine settlement process

**Operational Impact:** Specific impact on brokers/members who failed to deliver securities and must now procure them through auction at potentially higher prices. May result in additional costs for defaulting members.

**Investor Impact:** Limited direct impact on retail investors. This is primarily a broker-to-broker settlement mechanism to ensure delivery obligations are met.

**Notable Observations:**
- Wide variety of stocks affected from large-cap (Infosys, Tata Motors) to small-cap companies
- Some stocks have very small quantities (1-2 shares) while others have significant quantities
- Presence of recently listed companies like Swiggy (50 shares) and Physicswalla (25 shares)
