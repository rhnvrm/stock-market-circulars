## Summary

BSE has announced that the equity shares of WESTERN OVERSEAS STUDY ABROAD LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544636), currently listed on the SME platform, will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to the Rolling segment (M Group) effective Friday, December 26, 2025. This follows the exchange's previous notice dated December 10, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: WESTERN OVERSEAS STUDY ABROAD LIMITED (SME IPO)
- Scrip Code: 544636
- Current Segment: Trade for Trade (MT Group)
- New Segment: Rolling Settlement (M Group)
- Effective Date: Friday, December 26, 2025
- Notice Number: 20251211-2
- Related Notice: 20251210-53 dated December 10, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The equity shares will transition from the Trade for Trade settlement mechanism to Rolling settlement. This represents a change in the trading and settlement framework applicable to the stock:

- **From MT Group**: Trade for Trade segment where transactions require upfront delivery and payment
- **To M Group**: Rolling settlement segment allowing standard T+1 settlement cycle

This transition is a standard progression for SME IPO stocks after meeting specified criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must update their systems to reflect the new group classification (M Group) for Scrip Code 544636
- Trading Members should contact Mr. Anurag Jain (Tel: 022-2272 8822) for further details or clarifications
- Members need to ensure appropriate risk management and trading controls are applied under the new segment classification

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: Thursday, December 11, 2025
- **Effective Date**: Friday, December 26, 2025
- **Reference Notice Date**: Wednesday, December 10, 2025 (Notice No. 20251210-53)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The transition to Rolling settlement typically enhances liquidity and trading flexibility for the stock, as it removes the constraints of Trade for Trade settlement. This may attract more institutional and retail participation.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading Members need to reconfigure their systems and update internal records to reflect the group change. The two-week notice period (December 11 to December 26) provides adequate time for implementation.

**Investor Impact**: Positive - Investors will benefit from improved liquidity and the ability to participate in intraday trading once the stock moves to Rolling settlement from the more restrictive Trade for Trade mechanism.
