## Summary

Vodafone Idea Limited issued a clarification regarding news articles about its shares falling 11% following a Supreme Court written order on Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues. The company responded to BSE and NSE queries about material price movement on October 30, 2025. The Supreme Court order, uploaded on October 29, 2025, indicates that the Union of India is willing to reconsider AGR dues demands, considering its 49% equity stake in the company and interests of 20 crore customers.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The news triggered an 11% decline in Vodafone Idea shares, reflecting market uncertainty about AGR liability. The Supreme Court order potentially provides relief by allowing reconsideration of dues.

**Financial Impact**: High significance as AGR dues represent substantial financial obligations. Potential reconsideration could materially affect company's liability and financial position.

**Strategic Impact**: Union of India's 49% equity stake and willingness to reconsider creates alignment between regulatory authority and company interests. The court's recognition of 20 crore customers' interests elevates this to a public interest matter.

**Legal Impact**: Court clarifies this falls within policy domain of Union of India, giving government flexibility to reconsider in view of changed circumstances while maintaining compliance with law.

**Operational Impact**: Affects 20 crore customers' service continuity and company's operational stability.
