## Summary

BSE has announced that pursuant to an order issued by the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal, the delisting of Typhoon Holdings Ltd (Scrip Code: 512307) stands rescinded. The company's status will be changed from "Delisted" to "Suspended" with effect from December 17, 2025. As a consequence of this change, the provisions of Regulation 24(1) and Regulation 24(2) of SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 are no longer applicable to the company.

## Key Points

- Delisting of Typhoon Holdings Ltd (Scrip Code: 512307) has been rescinded by order of Securities Appellate Tribunal
- Company status will change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"
- SEBI Delisting Regulations 24(1) and 24(2) will no longer apply to the company
- Notice issued by BSE Listing Compliance department

## Regulatory Changes

The rescission of delisting represents a reversal of the company's previous delisted status based on tribunal order. The change in status means:

- Regulation 24(1) of SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 - not applicable
- Regulation 24(2) of SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 - not applicable

The company will now be governed by regulations applicable to suspended securities rather than delisted securities.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements outlined for market participants in this circular. The notice is informational regarding the change in company status following the tribunal order.

## Important Dates

- **December 15, 2025**: Circular issued by BSE
- **December 17, 2025**: Effective date for status change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - This is a significant development as delisting rescissions are rare events. The change in status from delisted to suspended may impact shareholders of Typhoon Holdings Ltd who had previously dealt with the company's delisted status.

**Regulatory Impact**: The reversal of delisting based on Securities Appellate Tribunal order demonstrates the appellate process and its ability to overturn exchange decisions. The non-applicability of SEBI Delisting Regulations 24(1) and 24(2) changes the regulatory framework governing the company.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may have renewed rights or options regarding their holdings, though the suspended status still indicates trading restrictions. The change may affect corporate actions, disclosure requirements, and shareholder rights.
