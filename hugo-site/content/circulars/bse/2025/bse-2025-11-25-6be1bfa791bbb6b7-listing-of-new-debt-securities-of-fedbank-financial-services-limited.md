## Impact Assessment

This is a routine commercial paper listing with minimal market impact. The instrument is a short-term debt security (90-day tenor) issued on private placement basis by Fedbank Financial Services Limited, an NBFC. The high credit ratings (A1+ from both CRISIL and ICRA) indicate strong creditworthiness. The listing expands debt market offerings but has limited systemic significance given the private placement nature and standard commercial paper structure.
