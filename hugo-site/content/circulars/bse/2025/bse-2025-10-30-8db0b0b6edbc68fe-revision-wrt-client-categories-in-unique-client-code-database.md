title: Revision w.r.t Client Categories in Unique Client Code Database - NRI Reclassification
  to NRE/NRO
---

## Summary

BSE is revising client categories in the Unique Client Code (UCC) database to facilitate better identification of Non-Resident External (NRE) and Non-Resident Ordinary (NRO) clients. Effective November 22, 2025, the existing "NRI" client category will be reclassified as "NRE", and a new "NRO" category will be introduced. Trading Members must update all client records accordingly in the UCC database.

## Key Points

- Existing NRI client category in UCC database will be renamed to NRE (Non-Resident External)
- New investor category NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) being created
- Changes designed to facilitate ease of identification of NRE and NRO clients
- No changes required for UCCs already created for NRE accounts
- Requisite changes may be undertaken for existing client categories
- Trading Members responsible for ensuring client records are updated

## Regulatory Changes

### UCC Database Client Classification Structure

**Revised Classification:**

| Client Type | Client Status | Client Category | Category Description | Remarks |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------|
| INDIVIDUAL (I) | CLIENT | NRE | Non-Resident External | Existing NRI clients will now be classified as NRE |
| INDIVIDUAL (I) | CLIENT | NRO | Non-Resident Ordinary | New category will be introduced for NRO account holders |

## Compliance Requirements

### For Trading Members:

1. **Update Client Records**: Ensure all client records are updated accordingly in the UCC database
2. **Verify NRE Accounts**: No change required if UCC has already been created for NRE account
3. **Classify NRO Clients**: Use new NRO category for Non-Resident Ordinary account holders
4. **Complete Updates**: Complete all necessary updates before the effective date

### Contact Information for Clarifications:

- **Email**: ucc@bseindia.com
- **Contact Persons**: 
  - Keyur Punatar, Deputy Vice President, Investigation
  - Poonam Pisat, Assistant Vice President, Investigation

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 30, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 22, 2025 - Revised classification and new NRO category available on UCC module
- **Deadline for Updates**: Trading Members should complete necessary updates before November 22, 2025

## Impact Assessment

### Operational Impact:

**Medium Impact** - This is an administrative and database classification change that affects Trading Members' client record management systems. The impact is operational rather than market-facing:

- **Trading Members**: Must review and update client category classifications for all NRI clients
- **System Updates**: May require updates to internal systems and processes to accommodate new NRO category
- **Client Communication**: May need to communicate changes to affected NRI clients
- **Data Migration**: Existing NRI records will be automatically treated as NRE from effective date

### Benefits:

- Improved clarity in distinguishing between NRE and NRO account types
- Better regulatory compliance and record-keeping
- Enhanced identification and tracking of non-resident client categories

### No Impact On:

- Trading operations or market functioning
- Client trading rights or privileges
- Existing NRE accounts (no action required)
