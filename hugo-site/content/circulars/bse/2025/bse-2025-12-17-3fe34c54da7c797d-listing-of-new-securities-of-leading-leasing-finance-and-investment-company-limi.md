## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to a single company's preferential allotment. The addition of 1 crore equity shares increases the tradable float of Leading Leasing Finance and Investment Company Limited, though shares remain locked-in for approximately 6.5 months. The preferential issue to non-promoters at Rs. 7.40 per share represents capital raising activity. Investors should note the significant lock-in period which restricts liquidity of these specific shares until mid-2026.
