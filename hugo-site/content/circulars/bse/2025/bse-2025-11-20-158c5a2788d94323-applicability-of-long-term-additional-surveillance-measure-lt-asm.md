## Summary

BSE has issued an update on securities subject to Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective November 21, 2025. Three securities are being added to the LT-ASM framework, while two securities are exiting the framework due to inclusion in ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure). No securities are moving between ASM stages or being placed directly in Stage IV.

## Key Points

- 3 new securities entering LT-ASM Framework: AIK Pipes and Polymers Ltd (544072), Darshan Orna Ltd (539884), and Indian Infotech & Software Ltd (509051)
- 2 securities exiting LT-ASM Framework: Sambhaav Media Ltd (511630) and Sizemasters Technology Ltd (513496)
- Securities exiting are moving to Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages within LT-ASM
- No securities being placed directly in Stage IV of LT-ASM
- Consolidated list includes multiple securities across different ASM stages (I to IV)

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework continues to operate as a surveillance tool to monitor securities with specific risk characteristics. Securities under LT-ASM are subject to additional trading restrictions and monitoring to protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure awareness of securities under LT-ASM framework
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in LT-ASM securities
- Applicable trading restrictions and surveillance measures must be followed
- Clients must be informed about securities under surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** November 21, 2025 - All changes to LT-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects trading conditions for 3 new securities entering surveillance and 2 securities transitioning to stricter ESM framework. The LT-ASM framework typically involves additional disclosure requirements, price bands, and trading restrictions.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities will face enhanced surveillance measures, which may include stricter margin requirements, trading limits, or settlement conditions. The transition of 2 securities to ESM indicates escalation of surveillance concerns.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and trading members need to update their systems and client communications to reflect the new surveillance status of these securities.
