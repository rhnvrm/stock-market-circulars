title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) - August
  14, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective August 14, 2025. Six new securities have been added to the ST-ASM framework, one security moves to a higher ASM stage, and seven securities are being removed from the framework.

## Key Points

- 6 new securities added to Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework
- 1 security (Inter Globe Finance Ltd) moves to higher Stage ASM
- 7 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework
- Framework includes special markings for SME scrips and T+0 scrips
- Consolidated list maintains current ASM stages for existing securities

## New Securities Added to ST-ASM

- First Fintec Ltd (532379)
- Kanungo Financiers Ltd (540515) 
- Kkalpana Industries (India) Ltd (526409)
- Morgan Ventures Ltd (526237)
- NDL Ventures Ltd (500189)
- Yatra Online Ltd (543992)

## Securities Moving Out of ST-ASM

- Ashram Online.Com Ltd
- Markolines Pavement Technologies Ltd
- Netweb Technologies India Ltd
- Saurashtra Cement Ltd
- Vintron Informatics Ltd (moving to LT-ASM)

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 14, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Securities under ST-ASM face enhanced surveillance with potential trading restrictions including higher margins, price bands, and settlement obligations. The addition of new securities indicates increased regulatory scrutiny due to price volatility or other risk factors. Securities moving out of the framework may experience normalized trading conditions unless moved to other surveillance measures.
