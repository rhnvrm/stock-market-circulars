## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This open offer represents a significant corporate action for Hypersoft Technologies Limited, potentially resulting in change of control or increased promoter holding. The offer price of Rs. 11 per share will serve as a reference price for shareholders considering participation.

**Shareholder Impact**: Public shareholders holding 22,17,160 shares have the opportunity to exit at the offer price. However, 36,05,000 preferential allotment shares remain locked-in and cannot participate, limiting immediate liquidity for those allottees.

**Operational Impact**: The acquirer will strengthen position in the company with potential acquisition of up to 26% of expanded capital. The unconditional nature of the offer (no minimum acceptance requirement) provides certainty to participating shareholders regarding completion.

**Regulatory Compliance**: The offer follows proper SEBI SAST Regulations compliance with all necessary approvals obtained from BSE and shareholders. The transaction structure with preferential issue followed by open offer is a standard mechanism for stake acquisition in listed companies.
