## Regulatory Changes

The price band mechanism is a surveillance tool that limits the maximum percentage change in a security's price during a trading session. The revised bands indicate:

- **2% Band (Highest Restriction)**: Applied to 3 companies - BGIL Films & Technologies (511664), Esha Media Research (531259), and Tamilnadu Steel Tubes (513540)
- **5% Band (Moderate Restriction)**: Applied to 16 companies including Bharat Bhushan Finance, Containe Technologies, Golkonda Aluminium, GTN Textiles, Jay Ushin, Kiduja India, Lancer Container Lines, Mac Hotels, Magnus Steel, Octaware Technologies, Onelife Capital Advisors, TCM, and Vani Commercials
- **10% Band (Standard Restriction)**: Applied to 4 companies - Contil India, Duke Offshore, Keynote Financial Services, Nirmitee Robotics, Star Housing Finance, Thangamayil Jewellery, and Tierra Agrotech

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands from November 6, 2025
- All trading systems and risk management systems must be updated to reflect new price band limits
- Orders exceeding the revised price bands will be rejected by the trading system
- Members should communicate these changes to their clients trading in the affected securities
- For any clarification, members must write to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 4, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 6, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The tightening of price bands indicates that BSE Surveillance has identified potential concerns with these securities, possibly related to volatility, liquidity issues, or other risk factors. Tighter price bands (2% and 5%) will significantly restrict intraday price movements, potentially reducing trading volumes and liquidity in these scrips.

**Trading Impact**: Investors and traders in these 23 securities will face limited price discovery on a daily basis. Those with short-term trading strategies may find reduced opportunities, while the measures protect against excessive volatility.

**Risk Management**: These surveillance measures are designed to protect investors from extreme price movements and potential manipulation. The varying levels (2%, 5%, 10%) suggest differentiated risk assessment by the exchange for each security.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and inform clients about the reduced trading ranges, especially for the 3 scrips with only 2% movement allowed per day.
