## Summary

BSE has announced that Ajmera Realty & Infra India Ltd (Scrip Code: 513349) will sub-divide its equity shares in a 1:5 ratio. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs.10/- will be split into five equity shares with a face value of Rs.2/- each. The record date for this sub-division is January 15, 2026.

## Key Points

- Company: Ajmera Realty & Infra India Ltd (Scrip Code: 513349)
- Sub-division ratio: 1:5 (One share of Rs.10/- split into five shares of Rs.2/- each)
- New face value: Rs.2/- per equity share
- Current ISIN (INE298G01027) for Rs.10/- shares will become invalid for exchange transactions from January 15, 2026
- New ISIN for Rs.2/- shares to be announced separately
- Notice Number: DR-799/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action involving share capital restructuring through sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date and adjust trading systems accordingly
- Transactions using the old ISIN (INE298G01027) will not be valid on or after January 15, 2026
- Market participants must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN once announced
- Dematerialised securities in rolling settlement segment are affected

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: January 15, 2026
- **Effective Date for Sub-Division**: January 15, 2026
- **Old ISIN Invalid From**: January 15, 2026
- **Notice Date**: December 26, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x while proportionally reducing the share price, making shares more affordable for retail investors and potentially improving liquidity. This is a neutral event from a valuation perspective as the market capitalization remains unchanged.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants need to update their systems to accommodate the new ISIN and face value. The old ISIN will cease to be valid for exchange transactions from the effective date. Investors holding shares will automatically receive the sub-divided shares in their demat accounts in the new ratio.
