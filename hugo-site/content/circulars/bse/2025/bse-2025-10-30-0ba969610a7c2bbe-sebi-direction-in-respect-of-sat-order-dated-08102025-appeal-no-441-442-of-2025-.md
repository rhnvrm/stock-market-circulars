## Summary

The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has issued an order dated October 8, 2025, in Appeal No. 441 of 2025 filed by Ashok Kumar Joshi against SEBI's penalty and debarment order related to Golden Tobacco Limited. The tribunal granted partial interim relief by staying the 18-month debarment order while requiring the appellant to deposit 50% of the Rs. 10 lakh penalty amount within four weeks. The stay was granted considering the significant delay between the appellant's resignation in 2019 and the show cause notice issued in 2023, despite the investigation period spanning 2009-2021.

## Impact Assessment

**Legal/Procedural Impact:**
The SAT order demonstrates the tribunal's willingness to grant interim relief in cases involving significant procedural delays. The 5-year gap between resignation and show cause notice issuance was a key factor in granting the stay on debarment, suggesting appellate tribunals will consider timing issues in enforcement matters.

**Market Impact:**
Limited direct market impact as the matter pertains to specific individuals and historical events (2009-2021 investigation period). Golden Tobacco Limited stakeholders should note the ongoing proceedings.

**Compliance Impact:**
The order illustrates that while SAT may grant relief on debarment orders, financial penalties still require partial payment pending appeal. Market participants facing similar enforcement actions should note that interim relief is conditional and case-specific.

**Precedential Value:**
The order may be relevant for other cases involving:
- Delays between resignation and enforcement action
- Balancing interim relief with partial penalty deposits
- Legacy investigations spanning multiple years

**Stakeholder Impact:**
- **Ashok Kumar Joshi**: Obtains temporary relief from debarment but must pay Rs. 5 lakh pending appeal
- **SEBI**: Enforcement action partially stayed but retains 50% penalty deposit with interest
- **Golden Tobacco Limited**: Ongoing proceedings may affect company reputation and governance assessments
