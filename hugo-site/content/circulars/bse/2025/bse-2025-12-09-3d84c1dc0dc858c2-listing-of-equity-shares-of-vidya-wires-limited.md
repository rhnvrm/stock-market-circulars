## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a standard new listing circular affecting only Vidya Wires Limited shareholders. The lock-in details ensure orderly market operations by preventing immediate selling by promoters and early investors.

**Liquidity**: Approximately 7.85 lakh shares (3.69% of total) are immediately available for trading. Liquidity will increase progressively as lock-ins expire, with significant releases in January 2026, March 2026, June 2026, and December 2026.

**Investor Impact**: Public shareholders who received IPO allotments can trade freely. Pre-IPO investors and promoters are restricted based on their lock-in schedules, ensuring price stability in the initial trading period.
