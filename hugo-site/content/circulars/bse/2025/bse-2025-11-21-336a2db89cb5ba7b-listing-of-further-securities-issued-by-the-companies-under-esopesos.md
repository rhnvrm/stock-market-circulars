None of the shares are under lock-in.

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members of the exchange should note the listing of these additional securities and update their systems accordingly. The shares will be available for trading from the effective date.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 21, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date**: Monday, November 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact on the market is minimal as these are relatively small quantities of shares being issued under employee incentive schemes. The listing represents routine corporate actions related to employee compensation and will result in marginal dilution of existing shareholding. The largest issuance is by Axis Bank with 164,286 shares, which represents a negligible percentage of its total equity. Trading members should update their records to reflect the increased share count for these companies, but no significant price movement or trading disruption is anticipated.
