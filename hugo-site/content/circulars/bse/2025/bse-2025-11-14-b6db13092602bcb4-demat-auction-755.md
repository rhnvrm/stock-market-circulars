---

## Summary

BSE has announced a Demat Auction for Settlement No. 755 dated November 14, 2025. The auction covers 110 securities across various scrip codes where delivery shortfalls have occurred. The auction will enable the exchange to close out pending delivery obligations by purchasing the required securities from the market on behalf of defaulting members.

## Key Points

- Settlement Number: 755
- Auction Date: November 14, 2025
- Total Securities Listed: 110 scrips
- Quantities range from 1 share to 10,000 shares depending on the security
- Covers diverse sectors including banking, pharmaceuticals, technology, manufacturing, and mutual funds
- Notable high-quantity auctions include: Hindware Home (10,000 shares), KANANI INDUS (2,527 shares), Tata Mutual (1,300 shares), SEPC LIMITED (1,100 shares)
- Major companies affected include Reliance Industries (234 shares), HDFC Bank (2 shares), Indian Oil Corporation (200 shares), Biocon (100 shares)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational auction process conducted by BSE to settle delivery obligations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members with shortfalls in the specified securities must participate in the auction or face close-out at auction prices
- Members are required to ensure sufficient securities are available for delivery to avoid auction situations
- Failed delivery obligations will be settled at the auction-determined prices

## Important Dates

- **Settlement Date**: November 14, 2025
- **Auction Date**: November 14, 2025 (typically conducted on settlement date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The auction affects 110 securities with varying quantities. While this represents a routine exchange mechanism, it indicates delivery failures across multiple scrips.

**Trading Member Impact**: Trading members with delivery shortfalls will face potential losses if auction prices are higher than their original transaction prices. This creates financial exposure for defaulting members.

**Investor Impact**: Limited direct impact on regular investors. The auction primarily affects institutional participants and brokers who failed to deliver securities.

**Liquidity Impact**: Temporary demand pressure on the listed securities during auction execution, potentially causing short-term price movements in lower-liquidity stocks.

**Operational Impact**: Standard settlement mechanism that maintains market integrity by ensuring all trades are ultimately settled either through delivery or auction-based close-out.
