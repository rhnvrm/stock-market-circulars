This change follows the exchange's previous notice dated December 01, 2025.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

The trading segment classification changes from a restrictive Trade for Trade basis (MT Group) to a more liquid Rolling settlement mechanism (M Group). This represents a graduation for the SME scrip to a standard trading framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new group classification (M Group)
- Trading members should contact Mr. Anurag Jain for further operational details and clarifications

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The shift from Trade for Trade (MT Group) to Rolling segment (M Group) will improve liquidity and ease of trading for SSMD Agrotech India Limited shares. Trade for Trade segments typically require full upfront delivery and payment, while Rolling segments allow for standard T+2 settlement with intraday trading flexibility.

**Market Participants**: Trading members and investors will benefit from enhanced liquidity and reduced settlement restrictions. This change indicates the company has met BSE's criteria for graduation from the more restrictive trading framework.

**Operational**: Trading systems and risk management parameters need to be updated to accommodate the new group classification before the effective date.
