## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - While 106 scrips are affected, most quantities are relatively small except for STANDARD CAP. The auction mechanism ensures orderly settlement of failed trades.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members with shortages must arrange funds or securities for auction participation. The significant shortage in STANDARD CAP (5.75 million shares) may indicate specific settlement issues requiring attention.

**Investor Impact:** Minimal direct impact on retail investors. The auction process is a backstop mechanism to ensure settlement integrity and protect buyers who did not receive securities on the settlement date.
