title: TRAI Mandates Phase-wise Adoption of 1600-Series Numbers for BFSI Sector Entities
---

## Summary

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a mandatory direction requiring phase-wise adoption of the 1600-series numbering by entities in the Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) sector regulated by RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA. The initiative aims to enhance consumer trust, curb spam, and prevent fraudulent voice calls by enabling citizens to reliably identify legitimate calls from regulated financial institutions. Approximately 485 entities have already adopted the series, subscribing to over 2,800 numbers.

## Key Points

- TRAI mandates time-bound adoption of 1600-series numbers for BFSI sector entities regulated by RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA
- The 1600-series distinguishes service and transactional calls from regulated entities versus commercial communications
- 485 entities have already adopted the series with over 2,800 numbers subscribed
- Phase-wise implementation schedule issued after consultations with BFSI sector regulators through Joint Committee of Regulators (JCoR)
- Entities continuing to use standard 10-digit numbers for service calls must shift to 1600-series
- Insurance sector adoption timelines under discussion with IRDAI, to be notified separately
