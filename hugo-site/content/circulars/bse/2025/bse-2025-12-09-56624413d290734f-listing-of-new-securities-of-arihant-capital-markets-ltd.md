## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The preferential allotment represents a relatively small issuance of 5 lakh shares at Rs. 87 per share, totaling approximately Rs. 4.35 crores. This is a routine corporate action for capital raising.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal impact on trading members. The shares will be available for trading from December 10, 2025, but are subject to a lock-in period until June 25, 2026, which prevents immediate selloff by allottees.

**Dilution**: The extent of dilution to existing shareholders depends on the pre-issue capital base, but the absolute number of shares is modest for an established brokerage and capital markets firm.

**Lock-in Consideration**: All preferentially allotted shares are locked in for approximately 18 months from the allotment date, providing stability and preventing immediate selling pressure.
