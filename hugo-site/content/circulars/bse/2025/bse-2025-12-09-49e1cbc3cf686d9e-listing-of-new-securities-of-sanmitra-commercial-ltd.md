No regulatory changes introduced. This circular announces compliance with existing listing requirements for new securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the listing of new securities for trading purposes
- Lock-in restrictions must be enforced as per specified timelines
- Trading systems to be updated to reflect increased share capital

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: October 17, 2025
- **Listing Date**: December 10, 2025 (Wednesday)
- **Lock-in Expiry (Promoters)**: June 30, 2027 for 3,18,66,799 shares (Distinctive Nos. 1100001 to 32966799)
- **Lock-in Expiry (Non-Promoters)**: June 30, 2026 for 1,68,05,701 shares (Distinctive Nos. 32966800 to 49772500)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing represents a substantial increase in share capital, with promoters receiving shares at Rs. 15/- while non-promoters paid Rs. 40/-, indicating significant premium for outside investors. The differential pricing suggests strong promoter involvement in capital restructuring.

**Liquidity Impact**: While 4.87 crore new shares are being added, the lock-in periods will restrict immediate tradability. 3.19 crore promoter shares locked until mid-2027 and 1.68 crore non-promoter shares locked until mid-2026 will limit free float in the near term.

**Capital Structure Impact**: The share swap component (2.97 crore shares) suggests possible consolidation or acquisition activity. The preferential allotment raises significant capital at premium valuations, potentially for business expansion or debt reduction.

**Investor Considerations**: Existing shareholders should note potential dilution effects. The 2.67x price differential between promoter and non-promoter issue prices warrants scrutiny of the company's valuation rationale and use of proceeds.
