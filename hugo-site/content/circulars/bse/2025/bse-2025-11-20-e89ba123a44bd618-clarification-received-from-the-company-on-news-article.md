## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The disclosure provides transparency on ongoing legal proceedings that may have generated media attention. However, the company's emphasis that regulatory agencies found no wrongdoing and that most loans have been repaid with interest should mitigate negative investor sentiment.
