## Summary

BSE has announced the discontinuation of weekly trading facility for Neogem India Ltd (Scrip Code: 526195) effective December 09, 2025. The company had been allowed trade-for-trade trading in Z group on the first trading day of every week following suspension for non-compliance with SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. As the mandated six-month period has been completed, this limited trading facility will be withdrawn.

## Key Points

- Weekly trading facility for Neogem India Ltd to be discontinued
- Company was suspended for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations
- Trading was allowed on trade-for-trade basis in Z group only on first trading day of each week
- Six-month mandated period has been completed
- Discontinuation follows SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024
- References previous Exchange Notice No. 20250421-22 dated April 21, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

This action implements the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for suspension and revocation of equity shares as outlined in Chapter-VII(A) of SEBI Master Circular regarding Penal Actions for Non-Compliance. The discontinuation represents the final step in the suspension process after the company failed to remedy its non-compliance during the six-month grace period.

## Compliance Requirements

No action required from market participants. The trading facility will be automatically discontinued. Market participants should note that no trading will be permitted in Neogem India Ltd securities after December 09, 2025 until the company achieves compliance and the suspension is revoked.

## Important Dates

- **April 21, 2025**: Initial suspension notice issued (Exchange Notice No. 20250421-22)
- **November 21, 2025**: Notice date for discontinuation announcement
- **December 09, 2025**: Effective date for discontinuation of weekly trading facility

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to Neogem India Ltd and its shareholders. The discontinuation affects an already severely restricted trading environment (trade-for-trade, Z group, one day per week). This represents the final stage of the suspension process for non-compliance. Investors holding these securities will have no trading avenue until the company resolves its compliance issues and BSE revokes the suspension.
