title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Framework Updates Effective November
  24, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework effective November 24, 2025. The circular identifies securities being newly added to ESM, securities moving to higher or lower ESM stages, and securities being removed from the ESM framework. This includes 2 new additions, 1 security moving to higher stage, 21 securities moving to lower stages, and 22 securities exiting the ESM framework entirely.

## Key Points

- 2 securities newly shortlisted for ESM: AVI Polymers Ltd and Securekloud Technologies Ltd
- 1 security moving to higher ESM stage: UTL Industries Ltd
- 21 securities moving to lower ESM stages including Aarey Drugs, Anka India, Mirc Electronics, and others
- 22 securities moving out of ESM Framework completely
- Changes effective from November 24, 2025
- ESM framework is used to monitor securities with abnormal price movements or high volatility

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework applies differential surveillance mechanisms based on security behavior. Securities moving into ESM face additional monitoring and potential trading restrictions. Movement between ESM stages indicates changing risk profiles - higher stages typically involve stricter surveillance while lower stages indicate improved market behavior.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of ESM status changes for affected securities
- Trading members should inform clients about securities under ESM and associated risks
- Investors should exercise caution when trading ESM securities
- Securities in ESM may have additional margin requirements or trading restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 24, 2025 - All ESM framework changes take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The changes affect 44 securities total. For the 2 newly added securities and 1 moving to higher ESM stage, investors may face increased margins and trading restrictions. The 21 securities moving to lower stages will experience relaxed surveillance, potentially improving liquidity. The 22 securities exiting ESM entirely will return to normal trading conditions, likely improving investor sentiment and trading volumes for those stocks.

**Trading Impact**: Securities entering or moving to higher ESM stages may experience reduced liquidity and higher volatility. Securities moving to lower stages or exiting ESM may see improved trading activity.
