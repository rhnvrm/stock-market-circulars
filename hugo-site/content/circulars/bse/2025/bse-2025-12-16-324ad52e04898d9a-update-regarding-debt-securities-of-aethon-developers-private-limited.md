## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The change from fixed to reset rate coupon structure affects yield calculations and pricing for holders and potential investors of ADPL debt securities. The new ISIN requires system updates across trading platforms.

**Investor Impact:** Existing holders of the debt security will see their coupon payments move from a fixed 11% rate to a reset rate mechanism, which introduces interest rate variability based on the reset terms.

**Operational Impact:** Trading Members must ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN and trading parameters by December 17, 2025 to ensure smooth trading operations. The change in identification parameters (ISIN, Scrip ID, Abbreviated Name) requires database and system updates.
