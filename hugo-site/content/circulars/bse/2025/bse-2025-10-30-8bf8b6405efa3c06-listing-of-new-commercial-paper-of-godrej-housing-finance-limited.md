## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of commercial papers on private placement basis with limited secondary market trading activity expected.

**Issuer Impact**: Provides short-term funding of Rs. 300 crores to Godrej Housing Finance Limited for working capital and operational requirements.

**Investor Impact**: Offers institutional investors high-rated (A1+) short-term debt instruments with approximately 3-month tenure and implicit yield of around 6-7% annualized based on the discount.

**Liquidity**: Limited, as commercial papers on private placement basis typically have restricted trading and are held till maturity by institutional investors.

**Credit Quality**: Strong, as evidenced by dual A1+ ratings from CRISIL and ICRA, indicating highest degree of safety regarding timely payment of financial obligations.
