## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine administrative circular for listing securities already issued under approved ESOP/ESOS schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital of the listed companies
- The new shares will be fungible with existing equity shares of the respective companies
- No specific compliance actions required from market participants beyond normal trading operations

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 17, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date:** December 18, 2025 (Thursday)
- **Lock-in Period:** Not Applicable (NA) for all securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The listed shares represent a small percentage of the total outstanding shares for each company. The largest absolute issuance is 1,163,301 shares by Sequent Scientific Limited, followed by 623,607 shares by SBFC Finance Limited and 571,443 shares by IDFC First Bank Limited.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible immediate impact on liquidity as these shares were already allocated to employees and may have holding restrictions or employee preferences for long-term holding.

**Dilution Impact:** Minor dilution for existing shareholders as ESOP/ESOS issuances are typically small relative to total share capital and are anticipated as part of employee compensation structures.

**Operational Impact:** Routine listing process with no disruption to normal market operations. All shares are immediately available for trading without lock-in restrictions.
