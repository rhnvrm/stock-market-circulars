## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine index maintenance activity following new stock listings.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements. Index tracking funds and portfolios may need to rebalance to reflect the new index constituents.

## Important Dates

- **December 17, 2025**: Listing date for all four companies
- **December 18, 2025**: Effective date for BSE SME IPO index additions (Shipwaves Online and Unisem Agritech) at market open
- **December 19, 2025**: Effective date for BSE IPO index additions (Park Medi World and Nephrocare Health Services) at market open

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. These are routine index additions following IPO listings. Impact is primarily limited to:
- Index tracking funds that replicate BSE IPO and BSE SME IPO indices
- Passive investment strategies linked to these indices
- Trading volumes may see slight increase in these stocks as index funds acquire positions

The staggered effective dates (December 18 vs December 19) allow for orderly inclusion without market disruption.
