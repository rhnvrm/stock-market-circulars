The companies failed to submit quarterly financial results for two consecutive quarters - March 2025 and June 2025. This action is pursuant to SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024.

## Key Points

- Suspension will be effective from December 15, 2025 (30 days from notice date)
- Entire promoter shareholding and all securities in promoter demat accounts will be frozen during suspension period
- After 15 days of suspension, trading will be allowed on Trade for Trade basis in Z group only on first trading day of every week for six months
- Companies can avoid suspension by complying before December 10, 2025
