BSE has announced the suspension of trading in non-convertible debentures of HDFC BANK LTD. (ISIN: INE040A08351, Code: 953107) effective November 28, 2025.

Trading members are advised not to deal in these specific debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action notification for debenture redemption and interest payment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures (ISIN: INE040A08351) from November 28, 2025
- Trading members must inform their clients holding these debentures about the suspension

## Important Dates

- **November 21, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 28, 2025**: Trading suspension begins (no dealings from this date)
- **November 29, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **December 15, 2025**: Expected maturity date (based on debenture identifier)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to Medium. The suspension affects only one specific ISIN of HDFC BANK's private placement debentures. This is a routine corporate action for debt instruments approaching maturity.

**Investor Impact**: Medium for debenture holders. Investors holding these debentures will receive their redemption proceeds and final interest payment. The one-day suspension period is standard practice to determine eligible investors as of the record date.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal. The suspension is brief (from November 28) and affects only private placement debentures, which typically have limited secondary market trading. Public market operations and equity trading in HDFC BANK remain unaffected.
