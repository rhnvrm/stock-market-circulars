title: Changes in Price Band for 16 Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for 16 securities effective from October 31, 2025. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20%, with notable changes including SKF India Ltd and Star Housing Finance Limited both set at 20% price bands. The changes are part of surveillance measures to manage volatility and protect investor interests.

## Key Points

- 16 securities will have revised price bands effective October 31, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% (tightest) to 20% (widest)
- Two securities have 20% price bands: SKF India Ltd and Star Housing Finance Limited
- Six securities have 10% price bands
- Seven securities have 5% price bands
- Two securities have 2% price bands (tightest restriction)
- Changes issued under BSE Surveillance department authority

## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions represent changes to the maximum permissible daily price movement for affected securities. Tighter bands (2%, 5%) indicate enhanced surveillance, while wider bands (20%) may reflect higher liquidity or different risk profiles.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands from October 31, 2025
- All trading systems must be updated to reflect new price limits
- Orders exceeding revised price bands will be rejected
- Members requiring clarifications should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 30, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 31, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The price band changes will directly impact intraday trading strategies and volatility for the 16 affected securities. Tighter bands (2-5%) on securities like Explicit Finance Ltd and Natura Hue Chem Ltd suggest heightened surveillance concerns, potentially limiting speculative activity. Wider bands (20%) on SKF India Ltd and Star Housing Finance Limited may facilitate better price discovery for these larger, more liquid securities. Traders and investors should adjust their risk management and order placement strategies accordingly.
