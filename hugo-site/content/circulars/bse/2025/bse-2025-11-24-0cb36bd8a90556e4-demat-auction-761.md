## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects 92 securities across various sectors. While most quantities are relatively small, the large shortage in GV Films (489,533 shares) could create price volatility in that particular security.

**Operational Impact**: Direct impact on brokers/members with delivery shortages who must participate in auction and bear associated costs. May result in penalties and additional costs for non-delivering members.

**Investor Impact**: Limited direct impact on retail investors. However, auction activity may cause temporary price movements in affected securities, particularly those with larger shortage quantities.
