No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

- Trading members are informed to note these additional shares for trading purposes
- Companies have completed necessary regulatory requirements for listing these ESOP shares

- **Notice Date**: November 13, 2025
- **Effective Listing Date**: November 14, 2025 (Friday)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The number of shares being listed represents a small fraction of the existing share capital for each company. The largest issuance is 518,840 shares by Capri Global Capital Limited, which is unlikely to significantly affect trading volumes or prices.

**Operational Impact**: Routine administrative update for trading members to update their systems with new share counts and distinctive number ranges.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for employees receiving ESOP benefits as shares become tradable. No lock-in restrictions provide immediate liquidity to employees.

**Dilution Effect**: Marginal equity dilution across all companies due to the relatively small number of shares compared to existing float.
