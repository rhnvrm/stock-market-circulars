## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine commercial paper listing by Reliance Retail Ventures Limited, a well-established corporate entity. The instrument is designed for institutional investors and does not affect retail market dynamics.

**Operational Impact**: Limited to trading members dealing in debt securities. Standard operational procedures apply for trading dematerialized debt instruments.

**Credit Quality**: High credit quality indicated by dual A1+ ratings from CARE and CRISIL, representing highest degree of safety regarding timely payment of financial obligations. The discount to face value (Rs. 4,92,582.50 vs Rs. 5,00,000) implies an implicit yield for the 91-day period.

**Liquidity**: Commercial papers typically have limited secondary market liquidity as they are usually held till maturity by institutional investors.
