- **Lock-in Expiry**: June 8, 2027
- **Notice Date**: December 8, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The listing involves a relatively small number of shares (4 lakh) representing capital infusion through preferential allotment to promoters. Since all shares are under complete lock-in until June 2027, there will be no immediate trading activity or liquidity impact from these securities. This is a standard corporate action that increases the company's equity base while maintaining promoter control. The pari-passu ranking ensures no differential rights between old and new shareholders.
