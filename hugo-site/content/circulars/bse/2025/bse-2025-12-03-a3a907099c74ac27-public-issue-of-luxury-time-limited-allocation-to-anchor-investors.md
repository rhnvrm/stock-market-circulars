## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The anchor investor allocation represents the pre-IPO institutional interest in Luxury Time Limited. The allocation of approximately Rs. 5.06 crore (6,17,600 shares × Rs. 82) to anchor investors indicates institutional confidence ahead of the public issue. The absence of mutual fund participation in the anchor portion is notable and may reflect fund-specific investment strategies or valuation considerations. The final pricing and overall subscription levels in the public portion will determine the success of the IPO.
