title: Changes in Price Band for 7 Securities Effective November 14, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for 7 securities effective November 14, 2025. The changes range from tightening bands to 5% for certain scrips to maintaining or setting wider bands of 10% and 20% for others. These revisions are part of surveillance measures to manage volatility and trading risks.

## Key Points

- Price band revisions effective from November 14, 2025
- 7 scrips affected across different price band categories
- Price bands range from 5% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive)
- Changes implemented under BSE Surveillance department
- Trading members notified through Notice No 20251113-59

## Affected Securities

### 5% Price Band
- **Epuja Spiritech Ltd** (Scrip Code: 532092)
- **HCP Plastene Bulkpack Ltd** (Scrip Code: 526717)
- **Retaggio Industries Ltd** (Scrip Code: 544391)

### 10% Price Band
- **Fischer Medical Ventures Ltd** (Scrip Code: 524743)
- **Gretex Corporate Services Ltd** (Scrip Code: 543324)
- **Technopack Polymers Ltd** (Scrip Code: 543656)

### 20% Price Band
- **TVS Holdings Ltd** (Scrip Code: 520056)

## Regulatory Changes

The price band mechanism is a surveillance tool used by BSE to control excessive volatility. Tighter price bands (5%) indicate heightened surveillance, while wider bands (20%) allow for more normal price discovery. The revision suggests ongoing monitoring of these securities based on their trading patterns, volatility, or compliance status.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new price bands before market opening on November 14, 2025
- All orders in the affected scrips must comply with the revised price band limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 13, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 14, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Securities with tighter 5% price bands will experience restricted intraday price movement, potentially affecting liquidity and trading volumes. The 20% band for TVS Holdings suggests normalized surveillance. Traders and investors in these scrips need to adjust their trading strategies accordingly. The differential treatment indicates BSE's risk-based approach to market surveillance.
