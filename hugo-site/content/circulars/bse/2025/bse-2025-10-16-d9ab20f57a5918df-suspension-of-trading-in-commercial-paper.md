## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any deals in the specified commercial papers from the "no dealings" dates
- Members should update their trading systems to block transactions in these securities
- Investors holding these commercial papers should be aware of the redemption schedule
- Settlement obligations for existing trades must be completed before suspension dates

## Important Dates

- **October 24, 2025**: No dealings start for 11 other CPs (Record dates: 24/10/2025 or 26/10/2025)
- **October 23-26, 2025**: Record dates for redemption across all affected securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to debt market participants and holders of these specific commercial papers. The suspension is procedural and related to normal redemption cycles.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure compliance by blocking transactions in these 12 securities. Firms with positions in these CPs should prepare for redemption settlements.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these commercial papers will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms. No secondary market liquidity available from suspension dates. Most suspensions begin on October 24, 2025, providing minimal advance notice period.

**Sector Coverage**: Diversified across financial services (NBFCs, brokerages, wealth management) and industrial (steel) sectors, indicating routine maturity-driven redemptions rather than credit concerns.
