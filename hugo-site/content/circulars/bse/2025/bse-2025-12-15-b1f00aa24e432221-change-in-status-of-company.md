## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 15, 2025
- **Effective Date of Status Change**: December 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Company Impact**: This is a significant development for Typhoon Holdings Ltd as the rescission of delisting provides a potential pathway for the company to address compliance issues and potentially restore normal trading status in the future.

**Shareholder Impact**: Shareholders of Typhoon Holdings Ltd may benefit from this decision as it keeps the door open for future trading restoration, unlike delisted status which is more final.

**Market Impact**: Limited market-wide impact as this affects a single company. However, it demonstrates the role of appellate mechanisms in securities regulation and may have precedential value for similar cases.

**Trading Status**: The company remains non-tradeable in suspended status but has not been permanently delisted, allowing for potential future restoration subject to meeting regulatory requirements.
