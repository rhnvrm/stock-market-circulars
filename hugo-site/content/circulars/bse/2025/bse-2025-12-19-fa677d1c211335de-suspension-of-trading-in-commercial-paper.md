## Summary

BSE has issued a notice suspending trading in commercial papers of 20 companies that have fixed record dates for redemption purposes. Trading members are advised not to deal in these commercial papers from the specified no-dealings dates, which range from December 23, 2025 to December 30, 2025. The suspensions are being implemented to facilitate the redemption process for maturing commercial papers.

## Key Points

- 20 commercial papers from various companies will have trading suspended
- Record dates for redemption range from December 23, 2025 to December 30, 2025
- No dealings start from December 23, 2025 to December 30, 2025 depending on the security
- Companies include major corporates like Adani Enterprises, Larsen & Toubro, Bajaj Finance, Avenue Supermarts, and ICICI Home Finance
- All suspensions are for the purpose of redemption of commercial paper
- Trading members are explicitly advised not to deal in these securities from the specified dates

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational notice for trading suspension related to corporate actions (redemption of commercial papers).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified commercial papers from the respective no-dealings dates
- Members must ensure their systems and operations account for these trading suspensions
- Compliance with the suspension dates is mandatory for all exchange participants

## Important Dates

- **December 23, 2025**: Record date and no dealings start for SBICAP Securities Ltd (SSL-24-12-25-CP)
- **December 24, 2025**: Record date for 360 ONE Prime Limited, Adani Enterprises, Vivriti Capital, Infina Finance, and Larsen & Toubro commercial papers; no dealings start December 24, 2025
- **December 24, 2025**: No dealings start for ICICI Home Finance (record date December 25, 2025)

- **December 30, 2025**: Record date and no dealings start for Capri Global Capital, Muthoottu Mini Financiers, and Bajaj Financial Securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The suspension affects 20 commercial paper instruments from diverse sectors including financial services, infrastructure, retail, and cement. While this is a routine corporate action, it temporarily removes liquidity from these debt securities.

**Operational Impact**: Trading desks dealing in commercial paper must update their systems to block trading in these specific ISINs. The clustered redemption dates (December 23-30) require careful tracking to ensure compliance.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these commercial papers should be aware that secondary market trading will not be available from the specified dates. Those wishing to exit positions must do so before the no-dealings date.

**Sector Concentration**: Significant representation from financial services companies (SBICAP Securities, 360 ONE entities, Bajaj entities, ICICI Home Finance, Vivriti Capital, Infina Finance, IndoStar Capital, Capri Global, Muthoottu Mini, SG Finserve) indicates year-end redemption activity in the NBFC and financial services sector.
