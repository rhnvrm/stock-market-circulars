## Summary

BSE has amended its Rules and Bye-laws to replace references to "arbitration" with "dispute resolution mechanism" and updated provisions related to trade annulment authorization. The amendments modify misconduct definitions in Chapter IV Rules and trade inviolability provisions in Chapter VII Bye-laws.

## Key Points

- Rule 3(f) of Chapter IV amended to replace "arbitration" with "dispute resolution mechanism" and "Arbitration Committee" with "arbitral tribunal"
- Rule 3(m) of Chapter IV amended to replace "arbitration charges" with "charges towards dispute resolution mechanism"
- Bye-law 5(b) of Chapter VII modified to remove specific reference to "Board or Managing Director" and authorize "person(s)/committee(s)" for trade annulment decisions
- Bye-law 5(e) of Chapter VII updated regarding review process for trade annulment decisions by Independent Oversight Committee
- All changes align with SEBI regulations and exchange circulars
