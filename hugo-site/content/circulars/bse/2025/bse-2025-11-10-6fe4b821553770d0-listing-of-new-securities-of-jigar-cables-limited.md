## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine preferential allotment for a small-cap company. The addition of 19.80 lakh shares represents a capital raising exercise through warrant conversion.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact as all shares are subject to lock-in periods ranging from 18 to 30 months. Only after lock-in expiry will these shares be available for trading in the secondary market.

**Dilution**: Existing shareholders may experience dilution depending on the pre-allotment share capital, though shares rank pari-passu with existing equity.
