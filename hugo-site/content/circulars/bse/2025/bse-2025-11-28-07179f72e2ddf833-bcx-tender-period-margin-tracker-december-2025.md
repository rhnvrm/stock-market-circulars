## Summary

BSE has released the Tender Period Margin (TPM) Tracker for December 2025 for the Commodity Derivatives Segment (BCX). The circular specifies progressive margin requirements during the tender period for Gold, GoldM, Silver, SilverKG, and SilverM futures contracts. Margins increase from 5% on the first day of the tender period to 25% (minimum delivery margin) on the expiry date.

## Key Points

- Tender period margins apply to commodity futures contracts approaching expiry
- Margins increase progressively: 5% (Day 1), 10% (Day 2), 15% (Day 3), 20% (Day 4), 25% (Expiry)
- Minimum delivery margin is set at 25% for all commodities
- Gold, GoldM, and Silver contracts expire on December 5, 2025
- SilverKG and SilverM contracts expire on December 31, 2025
- Holiday periods (December 25, 27, 28) are marked for SilverKG and SilverM tender periods

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine publication of predetermined margin schedules for the upcoming month's contract expiries in the commodity derivatives segment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure adequate margin collection from clients holding positions in these contracts during tender period
- Clients must maintain progressively higher margins as contracts approach expiry
- Positions carried into tender period require increased funding to meet escalating margin obligations
- Members must adhere to the specified margin percentages on respective dates

**Gold, GoldM, Silver (Expiry: December 5, 2025):**
- December 1, 2025: 5% margin
- December 2, 2025: 10% margin
- December 3, 2025: 15% margin
- December 4, 2025: 20% margin

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects traders holding commodity futures positions near expiry. Progressive margin increases encourage position squaring or delivery preparation.

**Operational Impact:** Routine operational requirement for brokers and clearing members to monitor and collect additional margins from clients during tender period.

**Liquidity Impact:** May reduce speculative positions as expiry approaches due to higher margin requirements, potentially reducing liquidity in expiring contracts while encouraging rollover to next month contracts.

**Risk Management:** Designed to reduce settlement risk by ensuring adequate margin coverage for physical delivery obligations.
