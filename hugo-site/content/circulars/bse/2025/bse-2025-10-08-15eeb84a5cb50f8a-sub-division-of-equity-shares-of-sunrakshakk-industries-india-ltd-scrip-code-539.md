## Summary

Sunrakshakk Industries India Ltd (Scrip Code: 539300) has fixed the record date of October 17, 2025 for the sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of face value Rs.10/- will be sub-divided into five equity shares of face value Rs.2/- each. The old ISIN (INE671K01019) will become invalid for exchange transactions from October 17, 2025, and a new ISIN for Rs.2/- paid-up shares will be announced separately.

## Key Points

- Company: Sunrakshakk Industries India Ltd
- Scrip Code: 539300
- Sub-division ratio: 1 share of Rs.10/- into 5 shares of Rs.2/-
- Record date: October 17, 2025
- Effective date: October 17, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE671K01019) will be invalidated from October 17, 2025
- New ISIN for Rs.2/- shares to be announced via separate notice
- Notice reference: DR-738/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action under existing BSE listing regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date of October 17, 2025
- The existing ISIN INE671K01019 (Rs.10/- paid-up) will not be valid for transactions on or after October 17, 2025
- Trading members must await separate notice for new ISIN details before processing transactions in Rs.2/- denomination
- All dematerialized securities will be affected in the rolling settlement segment

## Important Dates

- **October 8, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 17, 2025**: Record date for sub-division
- **October 17, 2025**: Effective date; old ISIN becomes invalid
- **TBA**: New ISIN announcement (separate notice to follow)

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: All existing shareholders will receive five shares of Rs.2/- each for every one share of Rs.10/- held as of the record date. The total investment value remains unchanged, but the number of shares increases proportionally.

**Trading Impact**: Trading in the scrip using the old ISIN will cease from October 17, 2025. Market participants must transition to the new ISIN once announced. Liquidity may be temporarily affected during the transition period.

**Operational Impact**: Depositories, brokers, and trading systems must update their records to reflect the new share denomination and ISIN. The sub-division typically improves affordability and may enhance retail participation by lowering the per-share price.
