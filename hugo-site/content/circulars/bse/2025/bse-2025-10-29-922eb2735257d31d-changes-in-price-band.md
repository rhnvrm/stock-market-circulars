title: Price Band Revisions for 24 Securities Effective October 30, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 24 securities effective from October 30, 2025. The changes include tightening or widening of circuit limits ranging from 2% to 20% across various scrips. Notable changes include CarTrade Tech Ltd moving to 10% band, Ladderup Finance Ltd to 10%, and two scrips (DELPHI WORLD MONEY LIMITED and MANGALAM INDUSTRIAL FINANCE LIMITED) set at 20% bands, indicating higher volatility allowance.

## Key Points

- 24 securities will have revised price bands from October 30, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive)
- 7 securities have 2% price bands: Hamps Bio, Jainco Projects, Kalpa Commercial, Norben Tea, Prozone Realty, Sea TV Network, Shree Pacetronix, and South India Paper Mills
- 9 securities have 5% price bands including A-1 Ltd, Ameenji Rubber, Chandni Machines, Infobeans Technologies, Lypsa Gems, Nureca, Om Metallogic, Response Informatics, Restile Ceramics, Symbiox Investment, and Trejhara Solutions
- 3 securities have 10% price bands: CarTrade Tech, Ladderup Finance, and Mittal Sections
- 2 securities have 20% price bands: DELPHI WORLD MONEY LIMITED and MANGALAM INDUSTRIAL FINANCE LIMITED
- Changes are surveillance measures to control volatility

## Regulatory Changes

The exchange has exercised its surveillance authority to modify price bands from existing levels. Price bands are circuit filters that limit the maximum price movement allowed for a security during a trading session. Tighter bands (2-5%) indicate securities under stricter surveillance, while wider bands (20%) allow greater price discovery but may signal higher risk or volatility profiles.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised price bands for the 24 affected securities
- Orders placed beyond the revised price band limits will be rejected
- Members should update their risk management systems to reflect new circuit limits
- Any clarifications should be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** October 29, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 30, 2025
- The revised price bands will be applicable from the start of trading on October 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** The price band revisions will directly affect intraday trading strategies, particularly for day traders and algorithmic trading systems. Securities with tighter 2% bands will have limited price movement, reducing speculation but also potentially impacting liquidity. Securities like DELPHI WORLD MONEY LIMITED and MANGALAM INDUSTRIAL FINANCE LIMITED with 20% bands suggest either higher volatility expectations or less restrictive surveillance.

**Investor Impact:** Retail and institutional investors should be aware that stop-loss orders and target prices may need adjustment based on the new circuit limits. Securities with tighter bands (2-5%) may experience frequent circuit hits during volatile sessions, potentially preventing order execution at desired prices.

**Market Significance:** The presence of multiple securities with restrictive 2-5% bands indicates ongoing surveillance concerns, possibly related to price volatility, corporate actions, or compliance issues. Investors should exercise caution and conduct additional due diligence on these securities.
