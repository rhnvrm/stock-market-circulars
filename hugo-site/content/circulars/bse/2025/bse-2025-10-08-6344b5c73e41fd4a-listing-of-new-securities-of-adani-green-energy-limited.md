## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The listing of 54.55 lakh shares represents additional equity capital raised through warrant conversion. However, shares are locked-in for promoters until April 2027, so no immediate selling pressure on the stock. The preferential allotment strengthens promoter holding and provides capital for company operations.

**Operational Impact**: Low for trading members - standard listing procedure with no special trading conditions beyond the lock-in restriction.

**Dilution**: The new shares will increase the total outstanding equity, causing minor dilution for existing non-promoter shareholders. The shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares for all purposes including dividends and voting rights.
