## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The preferential allotment to promoters is already factored into the company's shareholding pattern. The complete lock-in until July 2027 means these shares will not create immediate selling pressure or affect market liquidity.

**Promoter Holding Impact**: Moderate positive impact on promoter holding percentage due to warrant conversion and preferential allotment.

**Liquidity Impact**: Nil in the short to medium term due to lock-in restrictions. The shares will only become tradeable after July 31, 2027.
