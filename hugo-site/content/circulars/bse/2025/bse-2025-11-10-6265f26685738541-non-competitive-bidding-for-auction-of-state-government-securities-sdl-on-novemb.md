## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine debt market operation that provides retail and institutional investors access to state government securities through non-competitive bidding. The facility democratizes access to SDL auctions conducted by RBI.

**Operational Impact:** Low - Trading members familiar with the NCB-GSec module (operational since November 2019) can seamlessly participate. New participants may need user ID creation and familiarization with the bidding platform.

**Investor Impact:** Positive for debt market participants seeking fixed-income investments backed by state governments. The non-competitive bidding facility allows smaller investors to participate in government securities auctions without competing on price.
