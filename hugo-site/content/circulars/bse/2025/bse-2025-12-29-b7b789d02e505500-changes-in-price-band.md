## Summary

BSE has revised the price band percentages for 17 securities effective from December 30, 2025. The price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive), indicating varying levels of surveillance and trading controls. Four scrips have extremely tight 2% bands, while two scrips have wider 20% bands.

## Regulatory Changes

The Exchange has modified the price band framework for the affected securities under its surveillance authority. Price bands restrict the maximum percentage by which a stock's price can move (up or down) during a trading session. Tighter bands (2-5%) indicate enhanced surveillance measures, while wider bands (10-20%) allow greater price flexibility.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure trading systems reflect the new price bands from December 30, 2025
- Orders placed beyond the revised price band limits will be rejected
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com
- No action required from investors; the changes are automatically enforced by the trading system

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 29, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The revision of price bands affects trading dynamics and liquidity for these 17 securities. Scrips with tighter bands (2-5%) may experience reduced trading volumes and liquidity due to restricted price movement, typically indicating heightened surveillance concerns. Scrips with wider bands (10-20%) can accommodate larger price swings, potentially attracting higher volatility. Traders and investors in these securities should adjust their strategies considering the new price movement constraints. The measure is part of BSE's ongoing surveillance framework to maintain market integrity and protect investor interests.
