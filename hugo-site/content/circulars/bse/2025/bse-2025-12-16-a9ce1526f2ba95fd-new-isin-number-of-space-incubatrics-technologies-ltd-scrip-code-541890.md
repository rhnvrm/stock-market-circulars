## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division from Rs.10/- to Re.1/- (1:10 split) will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10 times while reducing the price proportionately, potentially improving liquidity and making shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members, custodians, and depositories need to ensure their systems correctly handle the ISIN transition on December 19, 2025. Existing shareholders will see their holdings adjusted automatically through the depository system.

**Investor Impact**: Medium - Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares of Re.1/- face value for every 1 share of Rs.10/- face value held. The market capitalization and proportionate ownership remain unchanged, but the nominal share price will be adjusted accordingly on the ex-date.
