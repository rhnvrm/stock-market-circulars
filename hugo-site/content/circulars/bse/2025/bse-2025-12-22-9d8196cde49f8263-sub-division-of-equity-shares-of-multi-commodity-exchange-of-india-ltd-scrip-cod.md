---

## Summary

BSE has announced that Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd (Scrip Code: 534091) will undergo a sub-division of equity shares. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs.10/- will be split into five equity shares with a face value of Rs.2/- each. The record date for this corporate action is January 2, 2026.

## Key Points

- Company: Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd (MCX)
- Scrip Code: 534091
- Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Ratio: 1 share of Rs.10/- split into 5 shares of Rs.2/- each
- Record Date: January 2, 2026
- Effective Date: January 2, 2026
- Current ISIN (INE745G01035) for Rs.10/- shares will become invalid for transactions from January 2, 2026
- New ISIN for Rs.2/- shares to be communicated separately

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action involving share capital restructuring through sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that the existing ISIN No. INE745G01035 (Rs.10/- paid up) will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after January 2, 2026
- Trading members must await separate notice for the new ISIN number for Rs.2/- paid up shares
- All trading and settlement systems must be updated to reflect the new share structure and ISIN from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 22, 2025
- **Record Date:** January 2, 2026
- **Effective Date for Sub-Division:** January 2, 2026
- **Old ISIN Invalid From:** January 2, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the per-share price proportionally. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors. The market capitalization remains unchanged.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and market participants must update their systems to handle the new ISIN and adjusted share structure. Shareholders will see their holdings multiplied by 5 with proportionally reduced face value per share.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. The total value of their investment remains the same, but improved liquidity may benefit trading activity.
