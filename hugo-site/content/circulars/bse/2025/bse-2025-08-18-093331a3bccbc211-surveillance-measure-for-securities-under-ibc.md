---

## Summary

BSE has issued surveillance measures for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) framework effective August 19, 2025. The circular includes stage transitions for various securities and excludes two companies from the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM).

## Key Points

- All stage transition lists show 'Nil' entries for August 19, 2025
- Two securities excluded from ASM under IBC framework
- Consolidated list maintains 13+ securities under various IBC stages
- Stage 0 represents receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure stage

## Regulatory Changes

- Securities moving between IBC surveillance stages
- Exclusion of specific securities from ASM framework
- Continued monitoring of securities under insolvency proceedings

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading restrictions apply to securities under IBC surveillance
- Enhanced disclosure requirements for listed companies
- Compliance with insolvency resolution process guidelines

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 19, 2025
- All stage transitions and exclusions take effect from this date

## Securities Excluded from ASM

- **Hindusthan National Glass & Industries Ltd** (Scrip Code: 515145, ISIN: INE952A01022)
- **Steelco Gujarat Ltd** (Scrip Code: 500399, ISIN: INE629B01024)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as most stage transition lists are empty. The exclusion of two securities from ASM may provide trading relief for those specific stocks. The consolidated list shows continued surveillance of securities under various stages of insolvency proceedings.
