## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure sufficient funds are available in their settlement account (valan account)/Exchange dues account before December 03, 2025

- **December 03, 2025**: SEBI turnover fees including 18% GST debited from settlement/Exchange dues accounts (3rd working day of the month)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine monthly operational requirement affecting all trading members across all segments. Members need to ensure adequate liquidity in their settlement accounts to cover the SEBI turnover fees plus 18% GST. The impact is predictable as fees are calculated based on monthly turnover, and members receive advance notice with detailed breakup before debit. Non-compliance could result in insufficient balance issues and potential operational disruptions. The notice provides transparency through advance availability of turnover details, fee calculations, and invoices, allowing members to verify and prepare for the debit.
