title: Non-Business Day for certain schemes of Mutual Fund on BSE StAR MF Platform
  - UPDATE
---

## Summary

BSE has notified non-business days for certain mutual fund schemes on the StAR MF Platform. Bandhan and Invesco mutual fund schemes will observe non-business days on November 11, 2025, and Invesco schemes will have an additional non-business day on November 27, 2025. This affects transaction processing for the specified fund of funds schemes.

## Key Points

- Bandhan US Treasury Bond 0-1 year Fund of Fund will be closed on November 11, 2025
- Four Invesco fund of funds schemes will be closed on November 11, 2025
- The same four Invesco fund of funds schemes will also be closed on November 27, 2025
- Affected Invesco schemes include: Pan European Equity FoF, Global Equity Income FoF, Global Consumer Trends FoF, and EQQQ Nasdaq-100 ETF FoF
- No transactions will be processed for these schemes on the specified non-business days

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard operational notification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors should note that purchase, redemption, and switch transactions for the affected schemes will not be processed on the specified non-business days
- Market participants should plan transactions accordingly to avoid disruptions
- BSE StAR MF Platform will not accept orders for these schemes on the notified dates

## Important Dates

- **November 11, 2025**: Non-business day for Bandhan US Treasury Bond 0-1 year FoF and all four Invesco fund of funds schemes
- **November 27, 2025**: Non-business day for all four Invesco fund of funds schemes

## Impact Assessment

The impact is minimal and limited to investors of the specific fund of funds schemes mentioned. The non-business days are likely due to holidays in the underlying international markets where these funds invest (US and European markets). Investors planning transactions in these schemes should be aware of the closure dates to avoid transaction failures. This does not affect other mutual fund schemes or general market operations on BSE.
