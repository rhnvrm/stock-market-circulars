This change follows the company's SME IPO listing and represents a shift in the trading mechanism for the stock.

## Key Points

- New Segment: Rolling segment (M Group)
- Effective Date: Friday, December 19, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The trading segment classification for LOGICIEL SOLUTIONS LIMITED is being upgraded from MT Group (Trade for Trade) to M Group (Rolling settlement). This change allows the stock to move from a compulsory delivery-based trading system to normal rolling settlement, which typically indicates improved liquidity and trading confidence in the security.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must note the segment change effective December 19, 2025
- All dealings in the equity shares will be conducted under M Group from the effective date
- Trading Members should contact the designated BSE official for any clarifications or additional details regarding the transition

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 05, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 19, 2025 (Friday)
- **Reference Notice**: December 04, 2025 (Notice No. 20251204-52)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The transfer from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment is positive for the stock's liquidity. Trade for Trade segment requires compulsory delivery of shares and full upfront payment, which restricts intraday trading and speculative activity. Moving to Rolling segment (M Group) allows for normal T+2 settlement, intraday trading, and potentially higher trading volumes.

**Market Implications**: This change typically occurs after a stock demonstrates stable trading patterns post-IPO and meets BSE's criteria for normal rolling settlement. It should improve accessibility for retail and institutional investors and may lead to increased market participation.

**Investor Considerations**: Investors can expect more flexible trading options, including intraday positions and margin trading facilities, once the stock moves to the Rolling segment.
