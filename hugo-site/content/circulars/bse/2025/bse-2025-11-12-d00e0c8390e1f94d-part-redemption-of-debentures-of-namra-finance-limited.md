## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market impact as it pertains to privately placed non-convertible debentures of NAMRA FINANCE LIMITED. Only holders of these specific debentures (ISIN: INE229U07137) are affected. The part redemption reduces the outstanding principal amount, and trading members need to update their systems to reflect the reduced face value of Rs. 70,000 per debenture. This is a routine debt servicing action with no broader market implications.
