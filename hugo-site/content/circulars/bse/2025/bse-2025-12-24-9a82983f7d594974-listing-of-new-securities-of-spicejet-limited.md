**Investor Considerations:**
- Existing shareholders should note the substantial increase in outstanding shares
- The 3-year lock-in provides stability as promoters cannot sell these shares until end of 2027

- Capital raised through warrant conversion strengthens company's equity base

**Trading Members:**
- Must update systems to reflect increased share capital
- All trading restrictions and lock-in provisions must be enforced in trading systems
