The turnover fees, subject to 18% GST (effective since July 18, 2022), will be debited from trading members' settlement (valan) accounts or Exchange dues accounts on November 6, 2025 (3rd working day of November). Members can review turnover details and download invoices from the BSE EXTRANET portal by November 4, 2025.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This notice reinforces the existing requirement that SEBI turnover fees are subject to 18% GST, which has been in effect since July 18, 2022.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members should review turnover details available in EXTRANET (current date > EQ > Transaction) by November 4, 2025

## Important Dates

- **October 31, 2025**: Notice date
- **November 4, 2025**: Turnover details and invoices available in EXTRANET
- **November 6, 2025**: SEBI turnover fees including 18% GST debited from settlement/Exchange dues accounts

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: All BSE trading members across multiple segments (equity, derivatives, currency, commodity, debt, repo, EGR) must ensure adequate liquidity in their settlement accounts before November 6, 2025. This is a routine monthly payment obligation.

**Financial Impact**: The 18% GST increases the total outflow for SEBI turnover fees. Members need to factor this into their monthly cash flow planning and ensure sufficient account balances to avoid payment failures.

**Administrative Impact**: Members must monitor EXTRANET for turnover details and invoices, verify calculations in TF2A files (column 26), and reconcile multiple file formats (TF2A through TF2J) covering different segments. Failure to maintain adequate funds could result in compliance issues with the Exchange.
