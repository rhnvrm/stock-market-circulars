**Operational Impact**: Medium for debt market participants. Trading members and investors interested in Government Securities need to be aware of the bidding window and technical requirements for participation through the NCB-GSec module.

**Financial Impact**: The total auction size is Rs. 28,000 crores across two securities, which is significant for the debt market but represents routine government borrowing operations.
