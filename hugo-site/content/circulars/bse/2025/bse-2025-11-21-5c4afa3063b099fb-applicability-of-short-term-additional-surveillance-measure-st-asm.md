## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to be applied as per existing surveillance guidelines. Securities are categorized into different stages (5/15/30 Days) based on price volatility and volume patterns. The framework is designed to alert investors about securities that have witnessed abnormal price movements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note the revised surveillance status of affected securities
- Trading members must ensure compliance with ST-ASM framework requirements for newly added securities
- Enhanced due diligence required for securities under ST-ASM
- Investors should be aware of increased surveillance and potential trading restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 24, 2025 - Changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The addition of securities to ST-ASM framework typically results in increased margin requirements and potential trading restrictions to curb excessive speculation. Securities moving out of ST-ASM may experience improved liquidity, though some are transitioning to other surveillance frameworks like ESM which may impose different restrictions. The inclusion of multiple SME scrips indicates heightened surveillance in the SME segment. Market participants should exercise caution when trading in newly added ST-ASM securities and monitor for further surveillance actions.
