## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- High trading volumes expected in affected stocks around the effective date due to index fund rebalancing
- Stocks being added may see buying pressure from passive funds
- Stocks being deleted may face selling pressure
- Estimated passive fund flows could be significant given the number of changes across multiple indices

**Operational Impact:**
- Fund managers need to execute rebalancing trades efficiently to minimize tracking error
- Increased volatility expected in constituent stocks during transition period
- Derivative positions linked to these indices may require adjustment

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Investors can anticipate index inclusion/exclusion effects for tactical positioning
- Long-term investors should evaluate fundamental merit independent of index membership
- The reconstitution reflects changes in market capitalization and liquidity of constituent stocks
