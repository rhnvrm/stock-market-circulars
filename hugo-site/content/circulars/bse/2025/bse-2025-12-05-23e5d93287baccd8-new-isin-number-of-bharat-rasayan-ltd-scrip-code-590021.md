---

## Summary

BSE has issued a new ISIN number INE838B01021 for BHARAT RASAYAN LTD (Scrip Code: 590021) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs.10/- to Rs.5/-. This is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251204-10 dated December 04, 2025. The new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date of December 12, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: BHARAT RASAYAN LTD (Scrip Code: 590021)
- New ISIN: INE838B01021
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Old Face Value: Rs.10/- per share
- New Face Value: Rs.5/- per share
- Ex-Date: December 12, 2025
- Record Type: DR-776/2025-2026
- Notice Date: December 05, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action where the company has subdivided its equity shares, requiring the allocation of a new ISIN to distinguish the new Rs.5/- face value shares from the old Rs.10/- face value shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must note the new ISIN number INE838B01021 for trades in BHARAT RASAYAN LTD equity shares
- The new ISIN must be used for all trades executed on or after December 12, 2025
- Systems and records should be updated to reflect the new ISIN and face value change
- Shareholders' demat accounts will be automatically updated with the subdivided shares in the new ISIN

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 05, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: December 12, 2025 (new ISIN becomes effective for trading)
- **Reference to Prior Notice**: Exchange Notice No. 20251204-10 dated December 04, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. Share sub-division is a positive corporate action that increases liquidity by reducing the per-share price, making shares more accessible to retail investors. The share count will double for existing shareholders while maintaining the same total investment value.

**Operational Impact**: Medium. Trading systems, clearing systems, and member back-offices must be updated to recognize the new ISIN from the ex-date. Proper system configuration is critical to ensure smooth trading operations.

**Investor Impact**: Neutral. Existing shareholders will receive additional shares in proportion to their holdings (1:1 split, receiving 2 shares of Rs.5/- for every 1 share of Rs.10/-). The total value of holdings remains unchanged, but increased share count may improve trading liquidity.
