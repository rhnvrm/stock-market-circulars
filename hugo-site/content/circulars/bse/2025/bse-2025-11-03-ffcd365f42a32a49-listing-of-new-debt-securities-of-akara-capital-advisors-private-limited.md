## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt security listing with minimal market impact. The private placement nature and dematerialized-only trading requirement limit the investor base to institutional and qualified participants. The 13% interest rate reflects the ICRA-BBB rating and current market conditions for non-banking financial company debt. Total issue size is Rs. 5 crore (5,000 units × Rs. 10,000), indicating a relatively small offering. No impact on equity markets or broader trading operations.
