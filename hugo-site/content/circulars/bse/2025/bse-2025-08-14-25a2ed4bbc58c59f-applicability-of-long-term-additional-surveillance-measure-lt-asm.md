## Summary

BSE has updated the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective August 18, 2025. The circular details securities being newly shortlisted, moved between ASM stages, and removed from the framework.

## Key Points

- 4 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework
- 3 securities moved to lower ASM Stage II from higher stages
- 3 securities moving out of Long Term ASM Framework
- No securities moved to higher ASM stages
- No securities directly placed in Stage IV Long Term ASM

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of revised Long Term ASM classifications
- Updated stage assignments for existing ASM securities
- Securities marked with special indicators for T+0 scrips and other frameworks

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note new ASM stage classifications
- Trading in affected securities subject to ASM requirements
- Brokers and investors to comply with applicable surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 18, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The changes affect trading parameters and surveillance measures for the listed securities. Securities moving out of LT-ASM will have reduced restrictions, while newly included securities will face enhanced surveillance. The moves to lower ASM stages indicate improved market behavior for those securities.
