## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine short-term funding instrument listing for Bajaj Finance Limited, one of India's leading NBFCs. The total amount of Rs. 1,050 crores represents standard treasury operations.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to institutional investors and debt market participants who invest in highly-rated commercial papers. The A1+ rating from both CRISIL and ICRA indicates lowest credit risk and highest safety for short-term instruments.

**Liquidity**: Commercial papers typically have limited secondary market trading as institutional investors usually hold them to maturity. The 71-day and 91-day tenures are standard short-term maturities.

**Operational Impact**: None for equity market participants. Debt segment traders gain two additional liquid short-term instruments from a blue-chip issuer.
