## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities available for trading
- Standard trading procedures apply from the effective date
- No special compliance obligations for market participants

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 4, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: December 5, 2025
- **Lock-in Period**: Not applicable for all securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing represents employee stock option exercises across multiple companies, resulting in minor equity dilution. The absence of lock-in restrictions means shares are immediately available for trading, though ESOP shares typically see gradual selling rather than immediate liquidation.

**Company Impact**: Routine capital structure adjustments. The share counts represent small percentages of existing equity for most companies, particularly large-cap stocks like ICICI Bank and Wipro.

**Investor Impact**: No significant impact on existing shareholders. ESOP listings are standard corporate events with negligible effect on stock prices or trading volumes.
