## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - This reconstitution will affect passive investment products tracking these indices, including ETFs and index funds. Fund managers will need to rebalance portfolios to align with the new index composition.

**Operational Impact**: Routine monthly maintenance of IPO-focused indices. The dropping of these securities indicates they have completed their tenure in the IPO index (typically 1 year from listing).

**Investor Impact**: Investors in index-tracking products may see automatic portfolio adjustments. The exclusion of these securities from the indices does not reflect on their individual merit but rather adherence to index methodology rules.
