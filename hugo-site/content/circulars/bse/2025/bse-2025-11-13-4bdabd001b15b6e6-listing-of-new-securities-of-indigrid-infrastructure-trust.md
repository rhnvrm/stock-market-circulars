## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The preferential issue adds 2.59 crore units to IndiGrid's outstanding unit capital, resulting in dilution for existing unitholders. The issue price of Rs. 168.77 per unit will serve as a reference point for valuation.

**Operational Impact**: The one-year complete lock-in on all new units prevents immediate selling pressure and provides stability to the unit price. The cash infusion from this preferential issue strengthens IndiGrid's financial position for infrastructure investments.

**Investor Impact**: Existing unitholders face dilution from the preferential issue to non-sponsors. However, the ranking pari-passu status ensures new unitholders have equal rights to distributions and voting.
