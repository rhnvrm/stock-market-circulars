- Trading members are advised not to deal in these T-bills effective from October 7, 2025
- Notice reference: DR-730/2025-2026
- Issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Operations (CRD)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine maturity process for T-bills. The suspension affects only those trading members actively dealing in these specific treasury bills.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal - Trading members need to update their systems to prevent trading in these securities. The two T-bills represent standard short-term government securities (91-day and 364-day tenures) that regularly mature and are replaced with new issuances.

**Investor Impact:** None for most investors - Holders of these T-bills will receive redemption proceeds at maturity. Only active traders in these specific securities need to be aware of the trading suspension.
