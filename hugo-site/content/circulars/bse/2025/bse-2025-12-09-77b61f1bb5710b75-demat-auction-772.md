## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 107 scrips with varying quantities. While most quantities are small, some scrips have significant volumes (SPRIGHT AGRO at 258,928 shares, SOUTH INDIAN at 6,000 shares).

**Operational Impact:** This is a routine settlement mechanism. Members with delivery shortfalls will need to procure shares through the auction, potentially at prices different from the original transaction price. The auction ensures that buyers receive their securities despite seller defaults.

**Investor Impact:** Buyers awaiting delivery of these securities will receive them after auction settlement. The mechanism protects investor interests by ensuring delivery completion.
