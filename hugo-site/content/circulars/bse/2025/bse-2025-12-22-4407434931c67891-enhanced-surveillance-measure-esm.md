## Compliance Requirements

- Securities under ESM framework are subject to additional surveillance measures including price bands, margin requirements, and trading restrictions
- Investors should exercise enhanced due diligence when trading in ESM securities
- Trading members must ensure compliance with ESM framework requirements
- Securities may be subject to trade-for-trade settlement mechanism
- Higher ESM stages typically involve stricter surveillance and trading conditions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 23, 2025
- **Circular Date:** December 22, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The inclusion of 9 new securities and upgrade of 4 securities to higher ESM stages indicates BSE's continued focus on market integrity and investor protection. Securities under ESM typically experience reduced liquidity due to additional restrictions.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities will face additional surveillance measures, potentially including stricter margin requirements, price bands, and reduced market liquidity. Higher ESM stages may result in more stringent restrictions.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new ESM classifications and ensure appropriate risk management measures are applied to these securities. The absence of securities moving to lower stages or exiting suggests persistent surveillance concerns across the listed securities.
