**Operational Impact**: Limited to debt segment trading members and institutional investors who participate in commercial paper markets. The listing provides an additional trading avenue for the instrument but does not affect equity markets or broader market operations.

**Investor Impact**: Relevant only for debt investors and institutions interested in highly-rated (A1+) short-term commercial paper with 90-day maturity. The discount on issue price (Rs. 4,92,399.50 vs Rs. 5,00,000 face value) implies an annualized yield for investors.
