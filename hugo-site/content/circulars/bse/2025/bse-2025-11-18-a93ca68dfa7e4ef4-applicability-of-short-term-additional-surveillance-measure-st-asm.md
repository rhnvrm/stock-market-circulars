The Short Term ASM framework is a surveillance measure that applies additional monitoring and trading restrictions to securities showing unusual price and volume behavior. Securities can be placed in different stages (5/15/30 days) based on severity, with each stage having specific trading restrictions and margin requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors trading in ST-ASM securities must be aware of enhanced surveillance measures
- Higher margins may be applicable on these securities
- Trading restrictions may include price bands, trade-for-trade segments, or other measures
- Market participants should review updated consolidated list in Annexure III

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 19, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**For Investors:**
- Existing holders of newly added securities may face trading restrictions and higher margin requirements
- Securities exiting ST-ASM will have eased trading conditions
- Increased scrutiny on price movements for securities entering the framework

**Market Impact:**
- Limited broader market impact as affected securities are primarily small/mid-cap stocks
- Enhanced investor protection through early warning system
- May lead to reduced liquidity in affected securities temporarily
- 2 SME scrips among additions and 2 among exits indicate active surveillance of smaller companies
