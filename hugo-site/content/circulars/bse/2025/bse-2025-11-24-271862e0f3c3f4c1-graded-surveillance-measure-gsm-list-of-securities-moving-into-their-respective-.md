title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Securities Moving to GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework affecting five securities. SSPN Finance Ltd is moving to GSM Stage 0 due to inclusion in the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework. Four other securities - Senthil Infotek Ltd, Auto Pins (India) Ltd, Polymac Thermoformers Ltd, and Soni Medicare Limited - are moving to GSM Stage I, indicating increased surveillance requirements.

## Key Points

- Five securities are moving into different GSM stages
- SSPN Finance Ltd (539026) moving to GSM Stage 0 (marked # for ESM Framework inclusion)
- Four securities moving to GSM Stage I: Senthil Infotek Ltd, Auto Pins (India) Ltd, Polymac Thermoformers Ltd, and Soni Medicare Limited
- Securities in GSM are subject to enhanced surveillance and trading restrictions
- Movement to lower GSM stage for SSPN Finance is due to inclusion in ESM Framework

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities based on specific criteria. Securities marked with (#) are moving to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in the ESM Framework, while those marked with ($) move lower due to inclusion in the IBC Framework.
