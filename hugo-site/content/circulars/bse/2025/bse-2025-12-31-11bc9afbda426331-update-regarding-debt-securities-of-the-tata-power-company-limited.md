title: Update Regarding Debt Securities of The Tata Power Company Limited
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update regarding the debt securities of The Tata Power Company Limited, detailing revisions to the coupon payment schedule for Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs). The changes are being implemented to align with the business day convention as specified in the Key Information Document (KID) and Information Memorandum.

## Key Points

- Coupon payment dates have been revised for certain periods due to business day convention requirements
- Face value per NCD is Rs. 100,000 (reducing to Rs. 70,000 after first partial redemption, then Rs. 40,000 after second partial redemption)
- Total of 18 coupon payments scheduled from March 2024 to September 2032
- Two partial redemptions planned at 14th and 16th coupon dates (September 2030 and September 2031)
- Final redemption scheduled for September 28, 2032
- Coupon periods range from 179 to 186 days
- Day count basis adjusts between 365 and 366 days based on leap years

## Regulatory Changes

The revision aligns payment dates with the redemption business day convention as per the Key Information Document. Specific changes include:

- 14th Coupon: Actual payment date changed from September 30, 2030 (Monday) to September 27, 2030 (Friday)
- 15th Coupon: Payment date remains September 27, 2030 (Friday) with adjusted coupon period days from 182 to 183
- 16th Coupon: Actual payment date changed from September 29, 2031 (Monday) to September 26, 2031 (Friday)
- 17th Coupon: Payment date remains September 26, 2031 (Friday) with adjusted parameters

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors and intermediaries should note the revised payment schedule for cash flow planning
- Updated cash flow schedules must be incorporated into investor records
- Payment processing systems should reflect the corrected business day conventions

## Important Dates

**Key Payment Milestones:**
- First Partial Redemption: September 27, 2030 (30% redemption - face value reduces to Rs. 70,000)
- Second Partial Redemption: September 26, 2031 (additional reduction - face value becomes Rs. 40,000)
- Final Redemption: September 28, 2032

**Modified Coupon Dates:**
- 14th & 15th Coupon: September 27, 2030 (changed from September 30, 2030)
- 16th & 17th Coupon: September 26, 2031 (changed from September 29, 2031)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium - This is a technical adjustment to ensure compliance with stated conventions rather than a material change to terms.

**Investor Impact:** Medium - NCD holders need to update their expected cash flow schedules. The changes affect timing of payments by 1-3 days for specific coupon periods, which may impact liquidity planning for institutional investors.

**Operational Impact:** Existing and revised cash flow schedules have been provided for transparency, ensuring investors can reconcile their records with the corrected payment timeline.
