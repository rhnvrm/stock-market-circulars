## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing event resulting from corporate action (conversion of partly paid to fully paid shares). The listing of approximately 296.89 million shares will increase the tradable float of SEPC Ltd. shares. As these shares are pari-passu with existing shares, they carry the same rights and privileges. The impact is neutral to moderately positive as it increases liquidity and completes the rights issue process. No immediate market disruption expected as this is a planned corporate action.
