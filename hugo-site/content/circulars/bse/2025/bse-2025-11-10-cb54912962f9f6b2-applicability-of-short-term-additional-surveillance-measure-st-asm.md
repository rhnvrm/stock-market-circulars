## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective November 11, 2025. The circular introduces 11 new securities into the ST-ASM framework, moves 1 security to a lower stage, and removes 2 securities from the framework (both moving to Enhanced Surveillance Measure). The ST-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance on securities exhibiting abnormal price movements over 5/15/30 day periods.

## Key Points

- 11 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework
- 1 security (United Cotfab Ltd) moved to lower Stage ASM while continuing in ST-ASM
- 2 securities removed from ST-ASM Framework (moving to ESM Framework)
- Multiple SME scrips included in the surveillance framework
- Changes effective from November 11, 2025
- Consolidated list includes securities across various ASM stages

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues BSE's surveillance mechanism to monitor securities with unusual price movements. Securities under this framework face enhanced monitoring and trading restrictions based on their stage classification. The framework operates on a progressive stage system where securities can move to higher or lower stages based on price behavior.

## Securities Added to ST-ASM (Effective November 11, 2025)

1. Aarnav Fashions Ltd (539562)
2. Ador Multiproducts Ltd (523120)
3. Getalong Enterprise Ltd (543372) - SME
4. Global Surfaces Ltd (543829)
5. Kunststoffe Industries Ltd (523594)
6. Lake Shore Realty Ltd (519612)
7. Mafia Trends Ltd (543613) - SME
8. Premco Global Ltd (530331)
9. Raghav Productivity Enhancers Ltd (539837)
10. Shriram Asset Management Company Ltd (531359)
11. Vanta Bioscience Ltd (540729) - SME

## Securities Moved to Lower Stage

- United Cotfab Ltd (544195) - SME scrip continuing in ST-ASM but moved to lower stage

## Securities Removed from ST-ASM

- G. K. P. Printing & Packaging Ltd (542666) - Moving to ESM Framework
- One Global Service Provider Ltd (514330) - Moving to ESM Framework

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members and market participants must:
- Be aware of enhanced surveillance measures on listed securities
- Monitor trading restrictions applicable to ST-ASM securities
- Follow stage-specific requirements for affected scrips
- Note that securities marked with @ are SME scrips under special surveillance

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 11, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 11 securities to ST-ASM indicates increased regulatory scrutiny on these scrips due to abnormal price movements. Investors trading these securities will face enhanced surveillance measures including potential price bands, higher margins, or trading restrictions depending on the ASM stage. The removal of 2 securities to ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure) framework suggests continued regulatory concerns requiring stricter monitoring. The framework aims to protect investor interests by curbing excessive speculation and price manipulation in vulnerable securities.
