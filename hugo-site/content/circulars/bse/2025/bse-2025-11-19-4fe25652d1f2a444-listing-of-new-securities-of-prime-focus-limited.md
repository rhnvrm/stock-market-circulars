## Compliance Requirements

- Lock-in compliance: Allottees must adhere to respective lock-in dates (May 24, 2026 for most tranches, May 24, 2027 for A2R Holdings' primary tranche)
- The shares cannot be transferred or sold until the lock-in period expires

- **May 24, 2026**: Lock-in expiry date for majority of allotted shares (14 tranches)

- **November 19, 2025**: Circular issuance date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The allotment of over 46 crore shares represents a substantial equity dilution event for Prime Focus Limited. Existing shareholders will experience ownership dilution proportional to the company's pre-allotment share capital.

**Investor Impact:** The lock-in periods provide stability by preventing immediate selling pressure. The extended lock-in for A2R Holdings' major stake (until 2027) suggests long-term strategic investment interest.

**Company Impact:** This capital raise likely strengthens Prime Focus Limited's financial position for business expansion, debt reduction, or operational requirements. The diverse investor base including institutional investors (Novator Capital, Chartered Finance), funds (Singularity Equity Fund I, Cohesion MK), and high-net-worth individuals indicates broad confidence in the company's prospects.

**Trading Impact:** Once the lock-in expires, potential overhang of shares may affect stock liquidity and price. Investors should monitor the promoter holding percentage post-allotment and track when locked-in shares become tradeable.
