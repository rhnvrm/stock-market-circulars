The corrigendum corrects a date mentioned in paragraph 40, page 17 of the original order from "May 14, 2025" to "January 16, 2025".

## Key Points

- Corrigendum issued to order reference number WTM/KV/CFID/CFID-TPD/31942/2025-26
- Date correction in paragraph 40, page 17 of the original order
- Incorrect date: May 14, 2025
- Correct date: January 16, 2025
- Corrigendum to be served upon all noticees, stock exchanges, registrar and transfer agents, and depositories
- Issued by Kamlesh C. Varshney, Whole Time Member, SEBI

## Regulatory Changes

No substantive regulatory changes. This is a technical correction to rectify a typographical error in a previously issued confirmatory order.

## Compliance Requirements

- Stock exchanges, registrar and transfer agents, and depositories must ensure necessary compliance based on the corrected date
- All noticees in the matter of Pacheli Industrial Finance Limited must note the date correction

## Important Dates

- **December 30, 2025**: Date of original confirmatory order
- **December 31, 2025**: Date of corrigendum issuance
- **January 16, 2025**: Corrected date (previously stated as May 14, 2025)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal impact as this is purely an administrative correction to fix a date error in a previously issued order. The correction ensures accuracy in the regulatory record but does not change the substantive content or implications of the original confirmatory order regarding Pacheli Industrial Finance Limited.
