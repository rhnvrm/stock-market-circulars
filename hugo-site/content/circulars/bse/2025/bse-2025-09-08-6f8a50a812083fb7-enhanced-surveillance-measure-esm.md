title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework Updates - September 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has updated its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework effective September 9, 2025. The circular introduces 6 new securities into the ESM framework and moves 5 existing securities to higher ESM stages. No securities are being moved to lower stages or removed from the framework.

## Key Points

- 6 securities newly added to ESM Framework including Barak Valley Cements Ltd, CHPL Industries Ltd, and Cryogenic Ogs Ltd
- 5 securities moved to higher ESM stages including Andhra Cements Ltd and Filtron Engineers Ltd
- No securities moved to lower ESM stages
- No securities removed from ESM Framework
- Comprehensive consolidated list includes 25+ securities across different ESM stages
- Framework includes both main board and SME scrips

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework continues BSE's risk management approach by:
- Applying additional monitoring to securities showing unusual price/volume behavior
- Implementing staged surveillance levels (Stage I, Stage II, etc.)
- Coordinating with NSE for certain securities marked with asterisk (*)
- Special designation for SME scrips marked with hash (#)

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of ESM classifications for affected securities
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in ESM securities
- Investors should understand additional surveillance implications
- Market participants must comply with any additional margin or position limits

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: September 9, 2025
- All ESM framework changes take effect from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

The ESM framework updates will:
- Increase monitoring and potential trading restrictions on newly added securities
- May result in higher volatility or reduced liquidity for affected stocks
- Provide enhanced investor protection through additional oversight
- Signal regulatory attention to price/volume anomalies in these securities
- Require increased attention from traders and investors in affected scrips
