## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: December 19, 2025 - For determining shareholder entitlement for the demerger
- **Ex-Entitlement Date**: December 19, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-781/2025-2026)
- **Group Transfer Date**: December 19, 2025 - Transfer from 'B' group to 'T' group
- **SPOS Date**: December 19, 2025 - Special Pre-open Session call auction

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The demerger represents a significant corporate restructuring that will result in three separately traded entities. The transfer to 'T' group indicates heightened surveillance and potential increased volatility. The SPOS mechanism will help with price discovery on the ex-date.

**Shareholder Impact**: High - Existing shareholders will receive shares in two new listed entities in addition to retaining their holdings in the demerged company. This 1:1:1 structure means shareholders will hold three different securities post-demerger, potentially affecting portfolio composition and liquidity considerations.

**Operational Impact**: The demerger separates two distinct business verticals (Chemical and Rayon), allowing each entity to focus on its core business independently. This could improve operational efficiency and strategic focus for each resulting company.

**Trading Impact**: The move to 'T' group will subject the scrip to additional restrictions and surveillance measures, potentially affecting trading volumes and liquidity during the transition period.
