## Summary

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities with abnormal price movements or other concerns. Securities under LT-ASM face trading restrictions including 100% upfront margin requirements and price bands. The framework includes multiple stages (I through IV) with progressively stricter surveillance measures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure 100% upfront margin for all transactions in LT-ASM securities
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance and associated trading restrictions
- Securities in higher ASM stages face more stringent trading conditions
- T+0 settlement scrips are also subject to LT-ASM based on parent company classification

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: November 10, 2025
- All changes to LT-ASM classifications take effect from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

The LT-ASM framework impacts liquidity and trading activity in affected securities. For the six newly added securities, investors will face enhanced margin requirements and potential price restrictions. The downgrade of CarTrade Tech and Dhyaani Tradeventtures to Stage I provides some relief with reduced surveillance intensity. KIOCL's direct placement in Stage IV indicates significant surveillance concerns. Securities moving out of LT-ASM will see easing of trading restrictions, though some have been moved to other surveillance frameworks (ESM) which may maintain similar restrictions.
