The company's status will be changed from "Delisted" to "Suspended" effective November 6, 2025. As a result, certain provisions of the SEBI Delisting Regulations are no longer applicable to the company.

## Key Points

- Rescission is pursuant to an order from the Securities Appellate Tribunal
- Company status will change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"
- Regulation 24(1) and Regulation 24(2) of SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 are no longer applicable
- Notice issued by Netra Sahani (Deputy Vice President, Listing Compliance) and Manish Raval (Manager, Listing Compliance)

## Regulatory Changes

The provisions of Regulation 24(1) and Regulation 24(2) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 are no longer applicable to Gammon India Ltd following the tribunal's order rescinding the delisting.

## Important Dates

- **November 3, 2025**: Notice date
- **November 6, 2025**: Effective date for status change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"

## Impact Assessment

This is a significant development for Gammon India Ltd and its stakeholders. The reversal of delisting based on a Securities Appellate Tribunal order represents a rare regulatory intervention. While the company moves from delisted to suspended status (not full trading resumption), this keeps open the possibility of future relisting. Shareholders who retained their holdings during the delisted period may see renewed prospects for liquidity. The suspended status indicates ongoing regulatory or compliance issues that need resolution before normal trading can resume.
