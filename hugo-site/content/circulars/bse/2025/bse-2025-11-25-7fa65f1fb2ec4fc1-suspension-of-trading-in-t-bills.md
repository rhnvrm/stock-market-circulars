## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in one Treasury Bill (T-bill) with SCRIP CODE 805109 (91TB281125, ISIN: IN002025X224) effective November 26, 2025. The suspension is being implemented because the T-bill will mature on its redemption date. Trading members are advised not to deal in this instrument from the specified date.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine suspension of a single T-bill instrument prior to its natural maturity date. Such suspensions are standard market practice to prevent trading activity in instruments approaching redemption.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members holding positions in this specific T-bill should be prepared for settlement at maturity. No impact on other debt instruments or market segments. The 91-day T-bill is a short-term government security, and its suspension affects only those with specific exposure to this ISIN.
