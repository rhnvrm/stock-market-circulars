BSE has approved the listing of 93,750 equity shares of Omega Interactive Technologies Ltd. (Scrip Code: 511644) issued to promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to warrant conversion. Trading will commence on November 27, 2025. The shares carry a lock-in period until June 29, 2027.

## Key Points

- 93,750 equity shares of Rs. 10 face value issued at Rs. 128 (including premium of Rs. 118)
- Shares issued to promoters on preferential basis pursuant to warrant conversion
- Distribution Numbers: 2497500 to 2591249
- Date of allotment: August 22, 2025
- ISIN: INE113B01029

- Complete lock-in on all shares until June 29, 2027

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced by this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities listing
- All 93,750 shares are subject to mandatory lock-in restrictions until June 29, 2027
- Shares cannot be transferred or traded by promoters during the lock-in period

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: August 22, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: November 27, 2025 (Thursday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: June 29, 2027

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment to promoters increases their stake but all shares are locked in for approximately 1.5 years, preventing immediate trading. The relatively small number of shares (93,750) issued at Rs. 128 represents a total issuance value of Rs. 12 lakh, which is negligible for market operations. The lock-in period provides price stability and demonstrates promoter commitment to the company.
