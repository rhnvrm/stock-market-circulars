## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to a routine corporate action affecting only specific debt securities of Kolte-Patil Developers Ltd. Debenture holders will receive partial redemption amounts, and the remaining principal will be reflected through reduced face values. Trading members dealing with these specific ISINs need to update their systems to reflect the new face values from October 15, 2025.
