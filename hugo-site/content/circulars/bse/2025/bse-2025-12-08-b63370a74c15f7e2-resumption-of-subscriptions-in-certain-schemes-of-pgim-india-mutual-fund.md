## Summary

PGIM India Asset Management Private Limited has announced the resumption of subscriptions in three designated overseas fund of funds schemes effective December 08, 2025. The schemes were previously under temporary subscription suspension since November 17, 2025. SEBI has permitted mutual funds to accept subscriptions and invest in overseas securities up to available headroom without breaching overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022.

## Key Points

- Subscriptions resume in three PGIM India fund of funds schemes from December 08, 2025
- Lumpsum transactions limited to maximum INR 2,00,00,000 per day, per investor, per scheme (at Primary holder PAN level)
- Applies to transactions received before cut-off time on any business day
- No fresh SIP, STP, or switch-in registrations allowed
- Existing registered SIPs/STPs will continue
- Based on SEBI letter no. SEBI/HO/OW/IMD-II/DoF3/P/25095/2022 dated June 17, 2022

## Designated Schemes

The following three schemes are covered under this notice:

1. PGIM India Global Equity Opportunities Fund of Fund
2. PGIM India Emerging Markets Equity Fund of Fund
3. PGIM India Global Select Real Estate Securities Fund of Fund

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has permitted mutual funds to accept subscriptions and invest in overseas funds/securities up to the headroom available without breaching the overseas investment limits as of end of day February 1, 2022 at mutual fund level. This regulatory allowance has enabled PGIM India to reopen subscriptions in the designated schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Lumpsum investments must not exceed INR 2 crore per day per investor per scheme
- Limit applies at Primary holder PAN level
- Transactions must be received before cut-off time on business days
- Unit holders should update PAN, KYC, email address, mobile number, and nominee details with AMC
- Unit holders should link their PAN with Aadhaar Number
- Investors advised to check for unclaimed redemptions or IDCW payments

## Important Dates

- **December 04, 2025**: Notice dated
- **December 08, 2025**: Effective date for resumption of subscriptions
- **November 17, 2025**: Previous suspension notice date
- **February 1, 2022**: Reference date for overseas investment limit headroom calculation (as per SEBI letter)
- **June 17, 2022**: SEBI permission letter date

## Impact Assessment

The resumption of subscriptions has limited market impact as it applies only to three specific fund of funds schemes managed by PGIM India Mutual Fund. The daily investment limit of INR 2 crore per investor provides controlled access while managing overseas investment exposure. The restriction on fresh SIP/STP registrations limits potential inflows, while allowing existing systematic plans to continue provides stability for current investors. This is a routine operational update affecting a specific subset of mutual fund investors interested in overseas equity and real estate exposure through fund of funds structures.
