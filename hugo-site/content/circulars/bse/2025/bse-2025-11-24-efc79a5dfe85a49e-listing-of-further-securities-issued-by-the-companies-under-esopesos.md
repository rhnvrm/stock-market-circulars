## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. The staggered release of approximately 731,000 shares over a 15-day period in December 2025 represents routine ESOP/ESOS listing activity. The quantities are relatively small and distributed across multiple dates, minimizing potential market pressure.

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal. The gradual unlock schedule prevents sudden supply increases in the market.

**Stakeholder Impact:** Affects employee option holders who will gain trading flexibility as their lock-in periods expire. Companies involved will see increased free float in small increments during the specified period.
