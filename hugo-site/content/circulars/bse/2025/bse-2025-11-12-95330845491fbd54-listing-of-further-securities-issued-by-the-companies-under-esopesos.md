- Companies have fulfilled listing requirements for securities issued under employee benefit schemes

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The share quantities represent routine ESOP/ESOS conversions and are relatively small compared to the companies' total outstanding shares. The absence of lock-in restrictions means shares can be traded immediately, but given the quantities involved, no significant price volatility is expected.

**Operational Impact**: Standard listing procedure with no special requirements for trading members beyond system updates to reflect the increased share count.

**Investor Impact**: Marginal dilution effect on existing shareholders. Employees exercising stock options will now have tradable securities, contributing to normal market liquidity.
