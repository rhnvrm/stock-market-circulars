## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders as on the record date will receive 4 additional shares for every 1 share held, resulting in a 5x increase in shareholding quantity. While the number of shares increases, the proportionate ownership and total value remains the same, with expected price adjustment post-bonus.

**Market Impact**: The issuance of over 91.66 crore bonus shares will significantly increase the company's outstanding shares and improve liquidity. The stock price is expected to adjust proportionally on the effective listing date.

**Trading Impact**: Shares will be available for trading from November 4, 2025 (BOD). Investors should note the adjusted price and increased float from the bonus issue.

**Liquidity Impact**: The substantial increase in outstanding shares (5x post-bonus) is likely to improve trading liquidity and reduce the share price to a more accessible range for retail investors.
