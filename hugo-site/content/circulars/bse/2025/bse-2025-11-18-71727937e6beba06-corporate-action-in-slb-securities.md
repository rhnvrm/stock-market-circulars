## Impact Assessment

### Market Impact
- SLB market liquidity may be temporarily reduced during shut periods for these 9 securities
- Borrowers holding positions beyond foreclosure dates will be liable for corporate action benefits
- The bonus issue for Thyrocare will require compulsory closure of all SLB positions by November 28, 2025

### Operational Impact
- Trading members and clearing members must monitor client positions and communicate shut period restrictions
- Risk management systems should be updated to prevent new SLB transactions during shut periods
- Settlement and delivery processes will be affected for securities undergoing corporate actions

### Investor Impact
- Investors with SLB positions must decide whether to close positions or bear corporate action obligations
- Dividend-related shut periods are relatively short (1-2 days) minimizing disruption
- Bonus issue foreclosure requires more careful position management due to permanent position closure requirement
