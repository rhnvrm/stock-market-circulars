- Enhanced due diligence may be required for trades in these securities
- Investors should be informed about surveillance status
- Additional margins may apply as per exchange requirements
- Members must monitor client activities in these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 18, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects 19 securities with changes in surveillance status. Addition to ST-ASM typically indicates recent unusual price movements or volatility, which may affect liquidity and trading interest.

**Trading Impact**: Securities newly added to ST-ASM Stage I will face enhanced surveillance, which may lead to reduced speculative activity and improved price discovery. Securities moving out (particularly those moving to LT-ASM) will continue under different surveillance frameworks.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of the enhanced surveillance status, which may affect trading costs, margins, and liquidity. The framework is designed to protect investor interests by monitoring unusual activities.
