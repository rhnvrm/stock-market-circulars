BSE has announced that the equity shares of Global Ocean Logistics India Limited (Scrip Code: 544665), an SME IPO listing, will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to the Rolling settlement segment (M Group) effective January 08, 2026. This change follows the Exchange's Notice No. 20251223-35 dated December 23, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Global Ocean Logistics India Limited (SME IPO)
- Scrip Code: 544665

- **January 08, 2026**: Effective date of transfer from MT Group to M Group

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This change is positive for the stock's liquidity as it moves from a restrictive Trade for Trade segment to Rolling settlement. This typically indicates the company has met BSE's criteria for normal trading and should result in improved trading volumes and price discovery.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members will need to update their systems and trading strategies for this scrip. The move to M Group allows for margin trading, short selling (subject to regulations), and more flexible position management compared to the Trade for Trade segment.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors will benefit from improved liquidity and the ability to trade the stock under normal settlement conditions rather than requiring full upfront payment.
