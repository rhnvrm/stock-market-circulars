## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This is a substantial capital raise for Brookfield India REIT, representing approximately 19% expansion in the unit base (assuming original unit base of ~57 crore units). The QIP route indicates strong institutional demand at Rs. 320 per unit.

**Unitholder Impact**: Existing unitholders will experience dilution of approximately 16-19% depending on the pre-QIP unit base. However, the capital raised will likely be deployed for acquisitions or development activities, potentially enhancing long-term value.

**Liquidity Impact**: The addition of 109.375 million units will significantly enhance trading liquidity for the REIT, making it more accessible to institutional and retail investors.

**Valuation**: The QIP pricing at Rs. 320 per unit provides a benchmark for current market valuation and institutional investor confidence in the REIT's portfolio and management.

**Operational Impact**: The approximately Rs. 3,500 crore capital infusion provides substantial dry powder for the REIT to pursue acquisition opportunities in commercial real estate or fund development projects within its existing portfolio.
