title: Extension of timeline for submission of the Cyber Security and Cyber Resilience
  Audit Report of Trading Members
---

## Summary

BSE has extended the deadline for trading members to submit their Cyber Security & Cyber Resilience Audit reports following representations from market participants. The preliminary audit report for the half-yearly period (April 2025 - September 2025) is now due on January 31, 2026, instead of the earlier deadline. This circular also clarifies the common submission mechanism for members registered with both BSE and NSE.

## Key Points

- Timeline extension granted in consultation with SEBI for cyber security audit report submissions
- Applies to Qualified REs and Mid-size/Small REs providing IBT or Algo Trading facilities
- Members registered with both BSE and NSE should submit reports only to NSE
- Members registered only with BSE must continue existing submission process to BSE
- Reference to SEBI-CSCRF (Cyber Security and Cyber Resilience Framework) requirements

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory requirements introduced. This circular provides timeline relief for existing SEBI-CSCRF audit requirements previously communicated via BSE circular 20251110-19 dated November 10, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

**Applicable to:**
- Qualified Regulated Entities (REs)
- Mid-size and Small REs providing Internet-Based Trading (IBT) or Algorithmic Trading facilities

**Submission Requirements:**
- Trading members registered with both BSE and NSE: Submit to NSE only (common submission mechanism)
- Trading members registered only with BSE: Submit directly to BSE as per existing process
- Audit must cover half-yearly period ending September 30, 2025

## Important Dates

| Audit Period | Report Type | Revised Due Date |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| April 2025 - September 2025 | Preliminary Audit Report | January 31, 2026 |
| April 2025 - September 2025 | Action Taken Report (if applicable) | April 30, 2026 |

**Previous circular references:**
- Exchange circular 20251110-19 dated November 10, 2025
- Exchange Notice 20250929-81 dated September 29, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - No direct impact on trading operations or market activities.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Provides compliance relief to trading members by extending deadlines, allowing more time for thorough audit completion and remediation if needed.

**Affected Entities:** Trading members classified as Qualified REs and Mid-size/Small REs offering IBT or algorithmic trading services. The extension reduces compliance pressure during the year-end period.

**Process Streamlining:** Implementation of common submission mechanism for dual-registered members reduces administrative burden and potential duplicate submissions.
