## Compliance Requirements

- Members should ensure compliance with revised price band limits effective from November 27, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The revision in price bands will impact trading volatility and risk management for the affected scrips. Tighter bands (5% and 10%) limit intraday price movements and reduce volatility risk, while wider bands (20%) allow greater price discovery but increase potential volatility. Traders and investors in these specific securities need to adjust their trading strategies and risk parameters accordingly. The measure appears to be part of BSE's surveillance framework to manage market stability.
