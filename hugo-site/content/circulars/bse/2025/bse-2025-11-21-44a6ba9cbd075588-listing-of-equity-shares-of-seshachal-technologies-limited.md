## Important Dates

- **November 21, 2025**: Circular notice date
- **November 25, 2025**: Effective listing date on BSE
- **September 29, 2025**: Record date for capital reduction (already passed)
- **June 6, 2016**: High Court approval date for capital reduction scheme

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact expected as this is a single small-cap company listing in the XT Group (companies traded in Trade-to-Trade segment). The capital reduction scheme was already approved in 2016 and the record date has passed (September 2025), so the restructuring is complete. The listing provides an exit opportunity for existing shareholders but is unlikely to generate significant trading interest given the Trade-to-Trade restrictions and small market capitalization. Relevant primarily to existing shareholders and potential investors in this specific security.
