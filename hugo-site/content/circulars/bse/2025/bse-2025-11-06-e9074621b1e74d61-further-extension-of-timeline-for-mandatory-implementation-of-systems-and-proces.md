title: Further Extension of Timeline for Mandatory Implementation of Systems by QSBs
  for T+0 Settlement Cycle
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued a further extension of the timeline for Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs) to implement mandatory systems and processes for enabling seamless investor participation in the optional T+0 settlement cycle. The original deadline of May 01, 2025 was previously extended to November 01, 2025, and has now been extended again with further guidance to be provided at a later date. This decision considers the challenges highlighted by QSBs in ensuring timely readiness of their systems.

## Key Points

- The mandatory implementation deadline for QSBs previously extended to November 01, 2025 is now further extended
- New timeline will be intimated at a later date based on QSB readiness
- QSBs must implement systems for enabling seamless investor participation in optional T+0 settlement cycle
- The extension applies to QSBs designated as such and meeting minimum active client parameters as on December 31, 2024
- All other provisions of the original SEBI Circular dated December 10, 2024 remain unchanged
- Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs) must implement necessary systems and amendments

## Regulatory Changes

This circular modifies the implementation timeline specified in:
- SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-3/P/CIR/2024/172 dated December 10, 2024 (original circular introducing optional T+0 settlement)
- SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-3/P/CIR/2025/58 dated April 29, 2025 (first extension to November 01, 2025)

The extension acknowledges operational challenges faced by QSBs in achieving system readiness within the previously stipulated timeframe.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs):**
- Must eventually implement necessary systems and processes for enabling seamless investor participation in optional T+0 settlement cycle
- Applies to brokers designated as QSBs meeting minimum active client parameters as on December 31, 2024
- Timeline for compliance to be announced at a later date

**For Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs):**
- Take necessary steps and implement required systems
- Make necessary amendments to byelaws, rules and regulations for implementation
- Bring provisions to notice of market participants including investors
- Disseminate information on their websites

## Important Dates

- **December 10, 2024**: Original SEBI circular introducing optional T+0 settlement
- **December 31, 2024**: Reference date for QSB designation and minimum active client parameters
- **May 01, 2025**: Original implementation deadline (first timeline)
- **April 29, 2025**: First extension circular issued
- **November 01, 2025**: Previous extended deadline (now further extended)
- **October 30, 2025**: Current circular issued
- **To Be Announced**: New implementation deadline for QSBs

## Impact Assessment

**Market Operations:**
The further extension delays the full-scale rollout of mandatory T+0 settlement infrastructure by QSBs but ensures more robust implementation when launched. Optional T+0 settlement remains available, but universal broker participation is postponed.

**Stock Brokers:**
Provides additional time for QSBs to develop and test systems, reducing implementation risks. Smaller brokers benefit from extended preparation period to meet technical and operational requirements.

**Investors:**
Delays universal access to T+0 settlement benefits through all QSBs, but ensures better system reliability when implemented. Investors can still access T+0 settlement through brokers who have voluntarily implemented the system.

**Technology Vendors:**
Extended timeline allows vendors more time to deliver compliant solutions to broker clients facing technical challenges.

**Regulatory Framework:**
Demonstrates regulatory flexibility in response to industry feedback while maintaining commitment to eventual T+0 settlement adoption.
