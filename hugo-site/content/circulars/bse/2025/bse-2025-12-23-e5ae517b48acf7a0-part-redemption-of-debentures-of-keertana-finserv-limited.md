## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it relates to specific corporate action on privately placed debentures of KEERTANA FINSERV LIMITED. The part redemption reduces the outstanding face value of the debentures, returning capital to debenture holders while maintaining the securities in trading with reduced values. Impact is limited to existing debenture holders and trading members dealing with these specific securities.
