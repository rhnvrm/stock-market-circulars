## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium. The auction involves a substantial Rs. 17,000 crore across multiple state securities, providing investment opportunities in government debt instruments. The participation of five states with varying tenures (2032-2055) offers diversification options for debt market participants.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and institutional investors participating in government securities market will need to coordinate bid submissions within specified timelines. The non-competitive bidding facility simplifies participation for retail and small institutional investors who cannot participate in competitive auctions.

**Liquidity Impact:** The auction will add fresh supply of SDL securities across multiple states and tenures, potentially affecting yields in the state government securities market segment. The mix of new issuances and re-issuances provides both fresh paper and additional liquidity in existing securities.
