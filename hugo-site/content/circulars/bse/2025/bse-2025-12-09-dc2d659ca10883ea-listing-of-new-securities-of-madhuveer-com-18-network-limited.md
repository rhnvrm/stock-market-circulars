## Important Dates

- **August 11, 2025**: Date of allotment
- **December 9, 2025**: Notice date
- **December 10, 2025**: Trading commencement date
- **October 31, 2027**: Lock-in period expiry date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine preferential allotment to promoters with a relatively small issue size of 10 lakh shares. The complete lock-in until October 2027 means these shares will not be available for trading in the near term, minimizing immediate market impact.

**Shareholder Impact**: The preferential issue to promoters likely increases promoter holding in the company. Existing shareholders should be aware of the dilution, though the impact depends on the company's existing share capital.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. This is an administrative listing notification with no operational changes for trading members beyond awareness of the newly listed securities.
