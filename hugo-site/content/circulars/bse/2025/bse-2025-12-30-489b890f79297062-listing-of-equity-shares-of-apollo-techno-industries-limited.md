## Impact Assessment

This listing adds Apollo Techno Industries Limited to BSE's equity segment. The staggered lock-in structure suggests a mix of promoter holdings (longer lock-ins) and anchor investor allocations (shorter lock-ins), with approximately 19% of total shares (2,639,000) immediately available for free trading. The gradual unlocking of shares over the next three years will progressively increase the free float, potentially impacting liquidity and price discovery in the stock.
