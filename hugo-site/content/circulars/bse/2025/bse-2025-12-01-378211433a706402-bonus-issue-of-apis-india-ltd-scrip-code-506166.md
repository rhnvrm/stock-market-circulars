## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders as of record date December 5, 2025 will receive bonus shares, increasing their shareholding quantity proportionally. The market price per share will adjust downward proportionally to maintain same market capitalization.

**Market Impact**: The bonus issue will increase the total outstanding shares of APIS India Limited significantly (by 13.22 crore shares). This will improve liquidity and make shares more affordable for retail investors due to lower per-share price post-bonus.

**Trading Impact**: No trading in bonus shares until December 9, 2025. Existing shares will continue trading, and the stock price will be adjusted for the bonus ratio on the ex-date.

**Operational Impact**: Standard corporate action process with tight timeline - crediting must be completed within one working day after record date, demonstrating efficient execution by company and depositories.
