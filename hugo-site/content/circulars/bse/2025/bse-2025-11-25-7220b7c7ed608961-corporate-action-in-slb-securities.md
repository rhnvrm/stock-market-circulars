## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects liquidity and trading in SLB segment for three securities during shut periods

**Operational Impact**: Participants must adjust their securities lending and borrowing strategies around these dates. Stock splits will affect the number of shares in circulation and potentially impact pricing dynamics. The shut periods, though brief (1-2 days each), will temporarily restrict SLB activities.

**Investor Considerations**: Shareholders must be aware of record dates to be eligible for dividends (Engineers India) and stock split benefits (CAMS and Mrs. Bectors). SLB participants should plan position adjustments before shut periods commence.
