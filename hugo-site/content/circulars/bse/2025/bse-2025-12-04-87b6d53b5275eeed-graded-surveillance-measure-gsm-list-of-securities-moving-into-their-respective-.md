## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of three securities into higher stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework.

The GSM framework is applied to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or other concerning trading patterns.

- Apt Packaging Ltd. (Security Code: 506979, ISIN: INE046E01025) is being moved to GSM Stage III
- Indergiri Finance Ltd. (Security Code: 531505, ISIN: INE628F01019) is being moved to GSM Stage III
- Securities marked (#) move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in ESM Framework

- Classification follows NSE standards as indicated

## Regulatory Changes

The movement to higher GSM stages brings additional surveillance measures and trading restrictions:

- **GSM Stage II**: Enhanced monitoring with potential trade-to-trade settlement, price bands, and additional margin requirements
- **GSM Stage III**: More stringent surveillance including mandatory trade-to-trade settlement, reduced price bands, higher margin requirements, and restricted trading conditions

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with enhanced surveillance requirements for these securities
- Clients trading in these securities should be aware of increased margin requirements
- Trade-to-trade settlement applies, meaning positions cannot be netted off
- All transactions in these securities will be subject to enhanced monitoring
- Brokers should inform clients about the GSM stage classification and associated restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 04, 2025 (circular issuance date)
- The GSM stage changes would typically take effect from the next trading session unless otherwise specified

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The movement to higher GSM stages significantly impacts liquidity and trading activity in these securities. Stage III classification is particularly restrictive and may deter speculative trading.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will face:
- Reduced liquidity due to trade-to-trade settlement
- Higher margin requirements leading to increased capital commitment
- Potential difficulty in executing large orders
- Enhanced scrutiny of trading activity

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new GSM stage classifications and ensure proper risk management controls are in place for these securities. The restrictions aim to protect investor interests by curbing excessive speculation and price manipulation.
