- No dealings permitted from: November 14, 2025
- Notice reference: DR-756/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - affects single debt security of a finance company with limited trading activity

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders as on record date (November 14, 2025) will receive redemption proceeds; no impact on investors not holding these specific debentures

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - routine suspension for debt redemption; trading members need to update trading restrictions for this specific ISIN

**Liquidity Impact**: No significant liquidity concerns as suspension is for redemption purpose and debentures are near maturity (November 29, 2025)
