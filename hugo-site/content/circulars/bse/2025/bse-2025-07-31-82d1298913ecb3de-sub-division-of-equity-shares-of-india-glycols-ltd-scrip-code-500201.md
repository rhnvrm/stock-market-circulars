## Summary

India Glycols Ltd (Scrip Code: 500201) has announced the sub-division of its equity shares from Rs.10 per share to Rs.5 per share in a 1:2 ratio. The record date for this corporate action is set for August 12, 2025.

## Key Points

- Each existing equity share of Rs.10 will be sub-divided into two equity shares of Rs.5 each
- Record date: August 12, 2025
- Effective date: August 12, 2025
- Current ISIN INE560A01015 (Rs.10 paid-up) will become invalid for trading from August 12, 2025
- New ISIN for Rs.5 paid-up shares will be communicated separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE560A01015 for Rs.10 paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after August 12, 2025. A new ISIN will be assigned for the Rs.5 paid-up shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the change in share denomination
- All transactions must use the new ISIN from the effective date
- Existing shareholders will automatically receive subdivided shares in their demat accounts

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: August 12, 2025
- **Effective Date**: August 12, 2025
- **Notice Date**: July 31, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This share sub-division will make the stock more affordable for retail investors by reducing the per-share price. The total value of holdings remains unchanged as shareholders receive two shares of Rs.5 for every one share of Rs.10. Trading systems and records will need to be updated to reflect the new share structure and ISIN.
