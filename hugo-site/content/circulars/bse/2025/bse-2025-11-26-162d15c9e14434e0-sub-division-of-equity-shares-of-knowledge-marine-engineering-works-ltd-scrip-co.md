  (Scrip Code: 543273)'
---

## Summary

BSE has announced that Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Ltd (Scrip Code: 543273) will undergo a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs.10/- will be split into two equity shares with a face value of Rs.5/- each. The record date for this corporate action is set for December 22, 2025, and the sub-divided shares will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Company: Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Ltd
- Scrip Code: 543273
- Corporate Action: Sub-division (Stock Split) of equity shares
- Ratio: 1 equity share of Rs.10/- split into 2 equity shares of Rs.5/- each
- Current ISIN: INE0CJD01011 (Rs.10/- paid up)
- New paid-up value: Rs.5/- per share
- The existing ISIN will not be valid for transactions from December 22, 2025 onwards
- A new ISIN number for Rs.5/- paid-up shares will be communicated separately

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action under existing regulations for share sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that the existing ISIN (INE0CJD01011) will become invalid for exchange transactions from December 22, 2025
- Trading members should await a separate notice from BSE announcing the new ISIN number for the Rs.5/- paid-up shares
- Members must update their systems to reflect the new share structure and ISIN post record date
- All transactions after the record date must be conducted using the new ISIN and revised share denomination

## Important Dates

- **November 26, 2025**: Notice date - announcement of sub-division
- **December 22, 2025**: Record date for sub-division
- **December 22, 2025**: Effective date - sub-divided shares with Rs.5/- face value come into effect
- **December 22, 2025**: Last date for validity of existing ISIN INE0CJD01011

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares while reducing the per-share price proportionally. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors due to lower absolute price per share. The market capitalization and shareholder value remain unchanged.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems, demat accounts, and clearing mechanisms need to be updated to reflect the new ISIN and revised share count. Shareholders will see their share quantity double while the per-share value halves, maintaining the same total investment value.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive two shares of Rs.5/- face value for every one share of Rs.10/- face value held as of the record date. The total value of their holdings remains the same, but the number of shares increases proportionally.
