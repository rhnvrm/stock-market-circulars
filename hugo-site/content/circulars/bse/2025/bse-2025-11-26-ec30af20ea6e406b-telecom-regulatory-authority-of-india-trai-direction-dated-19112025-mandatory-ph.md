title: 'TRAI Direction: Mandatory Phase-wise Adoption of 1600-Series Numbers for BFSI
  Entities'
---

## Summary

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a direction dated November 19, 2025, mandating phase-wise implementation of 1600-series numbers by entities regulated by RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA. This directive, issued under section 13 of the TRAI Act 1997, requires BFSI sector entities to exclusively use the dedicated 1600-series for service and transactional voice calls instead of ten-digit mobile numbers. The measure aims to curb promotional calls disguised as service calls, reduce spam and potential scams, and provide consumers with a distinct identifier for legitimate financial sector communications.

## Key Points

- TRAI directs mandatory adoption of 1600-series numbers for service and transactional voice calls by RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA regulated entities
- Direction issued under section 13, read with section 11(1)(b)(i) and (v) of TRAI Act, 1997
- DoT allocated 1600-series exclusively for Government entities and BFSI sector on December 23, 2024
- Access Providers were directed to initiate allocation on December 31, 2024
- Current adoption remains low despite consumer awareness campaigns
- Phase-wise implementation schedule to be enforced
- Applies to all entities in Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sectors
- Regulation 3 of Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018 provides the legal framework

## Regulatory Changes

This direction implements a mandatory numbering framework for commercial communications by BFSI entities. Under the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018, commercial communications must use registered headers or dedicated number resources. The 1600-series allocation specifically designates these numbers for:

- Service calls from financial institutions
- Transactional calls (payment confirmations, alerts, etc.)
- Government (Central/State) communications

The direction prohibits BFSI entities from continuing to use ten-digit mobile numbers for such communications, creating a clear segregation between legitimate financial sector calls and other communications.

## Compliance Requirements

**For SEBI Regulated Entities (including stock exchanges, brokers, mutual funds, etc.):**
- Must register for and adopt 1600-series numbers for all service and transactional voice calls
- Discontinue use of ten-digit mobile numbers for such communications
- Comply with phase-wise implementation timeline (specific dates to be notified)
- Ensure all outbound service/transactional calls originate only from allocated 1600-series numbers
- Register with Access Providers as Senders under the regulations

**For Access Providers:**
- Allocate 1600-series numbers to eligible BFSI entities
- Ensure commercial communications use only registered headers or designated number resources
- May suspend or disconnect telecom resources of non-compliant Senders

## Important Dates

- **December 23, 2024**: DoT decision to allocate 1600-series for Government and BFSI entities
- **December 31, 2024**: TRAI directed Access Providers to initiate allocation
- **November 19, 2025**: Direction issued for mandatory phase-wise implementation
- **Phase-wise deadlines**: To be specified in subsequent notifications based on interactions with RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- All SEBI-regulated entities including stock exchanges, brokers, depositories, mutual funds, and portfolio management services must implement new calling systems
- Operational changes required in customer communication infrastructure
- Technology upgrades needed to integrate 1600-series numbers

**Consumer Protection:**
- Enhanced ability to identify legitimate calls from financial institutions
- Reduced spam and scam calls masquerading as service communications
- Informed decision-making on call acceptance
- Clear segregation between promotional and service/transactional calls

**Compliance Impact:**
- Non-compliance may result in suspension or disconnection of telecom resources
- Regulatory enforcement by TRAI in coordination with sector regulators (SEBI, RBI, PFRDA)
- Entities must coordinate with telecom service providers for number allocation
- Potential customer communication during transition period required

**Operational Considerations:**
- BFSI entities need to update customer-facing documentation with new contact numbers
- Integration with existing CRM and communication systems
- Staff training on new calling protocols
- Customer awareness campaigns about the new number series
