## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing of mutual fund units that provides investors with an additional investment avenue in a hybrid long-short equity strategy. The scheme's close-ended nature and relatively small issue size (124,994 units) limit its immediate market impact.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to include the new scrip (Code: 544652, ISIN: INF277K30039) for trading from December 17, 2025. The dematerialized-only trading requirement is standard for mutual fund units.

**Investor Impact**: Investors interested in hybrid strategies with long-short equity exposure and IDCW payout options now have access to this Tata Mutual Fund scheme through BSE's trading platform.
