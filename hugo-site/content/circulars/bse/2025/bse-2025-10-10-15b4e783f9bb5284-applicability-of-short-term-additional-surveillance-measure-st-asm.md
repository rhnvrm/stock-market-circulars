## Regulatory Framework

The Short Term ASM Framework is a surveillance mechanism that applies additional monitoring and trading restrictions to securities exhibiting unusual price movements or volumes over short periods (5/15/30 days). Securities can transition between different surveillance frameworks based on their trading patterns and risk profiles.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the changed surveillance status of affected securities
- Trading in ST-ASM securities is subject to enhanced surveillance measures
- Securities may have modified trading parameters including price bands and settlement requirements
- Brokers and traders should adjust their risk management systems accordingly

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 13, 2025
- **Circular Date**: October 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of securities in ST-ASM framework typically results in reduced liquidity and increased trading costs due to stricter surveillance measures. For the 8 securities moving out, 3 are transitioning to other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM or ESM) which may maintain or increase restrictions, while 5 are exiting surveillance measures entirely. The addition of 13 new securities indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny on these stocks due to recent trading patterns. Market participants trading these securities should expect potential impacts on order execution, margin requirements, and overall trading flexibility.
