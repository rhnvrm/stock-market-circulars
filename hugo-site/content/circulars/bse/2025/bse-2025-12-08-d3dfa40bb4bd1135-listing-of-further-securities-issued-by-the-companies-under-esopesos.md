The newly issued equity shares will be listed and admitted for trading on the Exchange effective Tuesday, December 9, 2025. The total issuance includes approximately 2.71 million shares across various companies with face values ranging from ₹1 to ₹10. None of the shares are under lock-in period.

## Key Points

- 17 companies have issued further equity shares under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Effective listing date: December 9, 2025
- Total shares being listed: 2,712,508 shares approximately
- No shares are subject to lock-in restrictions (all marked as 'NA')

- Companies span banking, financial services, technology, healthcare, and manufacturing sectors

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks as per SEBI guidelines.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members of BSE are informed to update their systems for the new securities
- Companies must ensure proper disclosure of the new issuances in their shareholding patterns
- Standard post-listing compliance requirements apply as per SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 8, 2025
- **Effective Listing Date**: December 9, 2025 (Tuesday)
- **Lock-in Period**: Not applicable for any of the listed securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The shares being listed represent employee compensation and are relatively small in number compared to the existing equity base of these companies. The dilution effect on existing shareholders is minimal.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible immediate impact as ESOP shares typically come to the market gradually as employees exercise and sell their options.

**Investor Consideration**: This is routine corporate action indicating active employee incentive programs. The absence of lock-in periods means shares are immediately tradeable, though employees may hold for tax optimization.

**Sectoral Distribution**: Diverse representation across banking (Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Ujjivan SFB), fintech (Angel One, Paytm, KFin Technologies), technology (Tejas Networks, Mastek, Indegene, Latent View), and other sectors indicates broad-based employee participation programs across industries.
