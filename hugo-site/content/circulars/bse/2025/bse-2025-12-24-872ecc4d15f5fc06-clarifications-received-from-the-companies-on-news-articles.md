## Compliance Requirements

- Castrol India Limited has fulfilled its disclosure obligation under Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations 2015 by informing stock exchanges about the press release from ultimate holding company BP p.l.c.
- Transaction completion subject to obtaining regulatory approvals
- Shareholders should note the change in ultimate ownership structure post-transaction completion

## Important Dates

- **Press Release Date**: December 24, 2025
- **Expected Transaction Completion**: End of 2026 (subject to regulatory approvals)
- **Lock-up Period for BP's Retained Stake**: Two years from transaction completion

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - This is a significant corporate restructuring at the ultimate holding company level involving a $10 billion transaction. The creation of a new joint venture structure with Stonepeak acquiring majority control (65%) while BP retains 35% represents a fundamental change in Castrol's ownership and governance structure.

**Shareholder Impact**: The announcement directly affects Castrol India Limited shareholders as a significant proportion of the $1.8 billion in JV minority interests mentioned relates to the publicly listed Castrol India Limited. The change in ultimate ownership may impact strategic direction, dividend policies, and long-term growth plans.

**Operational Impact**: Medium to High - While Castrol has demonstrated strong performance with nine consecutive quarters of earnings growth, the transition to joint venture structure with new majority owner Stonepeak may bring changes in management approach, investment priorities, and operational strategies.

**Strategic Impact**: The transaction reflects BP's strategy to simplify its portfolio and strengthen its balance sheet by focusing on core downstream integrated businesses. For Castrol, partnering with Stonepeak (an infrastructure-focused investment firm) may provide different strategic opportunities and growth capital compared to being wholly owned by BP.

**Timeline Uncertainty**: The end-2026 completion timeline and regulatory approval requirements create a period of uncertainty that may affect stock price volatility and investor sentiment.
