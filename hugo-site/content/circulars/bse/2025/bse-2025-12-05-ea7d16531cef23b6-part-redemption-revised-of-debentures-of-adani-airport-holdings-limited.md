The debentures with ISIN INE0GCN07047 and Scrip Code 976065 (AAHL-9.35%-8-9-28-PVT) will trade at the revised reduced face value of Rs. 75,491 per debenture with effect from December 08, 2025.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - This revision affects holders and traders of AAHL debentures. The part redemption reduces the outstanding principal amount per debenture, which impacts the market value and yield calculations.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems are updated with the correct reduced face value before December 08, 2025 to avoid settlement issues. The revision suggests the actual redemption amount differed from initially communicated figures.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will receive partial repayment, and their remaining investment will be valued at the reduced face value. Future interest payments and final redemption will be based on this reduced face value of Rs. 75,491 per debenture.
