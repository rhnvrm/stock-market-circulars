title: Surveillance Measure for Securities Under IBC - Stage Updates
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updated surveillance measures for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) framework effective October 30, 2025. Kobo Biotech Ltd (Scrip Code: 531541, ISIN: INE881A01015) has been moved to Stage 1 of Additional Surveillance Measure for Companies relating to the Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP). No securities are being moved to Stage 0, moved from Stage I to Stage II, moved from Stage II to Stage I, or excluded from ASM measures in this update.

## Key Points

- One security added to IBC Stage 1 surveillance: Kobo Biotech Ltd
- No new securities added to Stage 0 (Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure)
- No movements between Stage I and Stage II
- No securities excluded from IBC surveillance framework
- Effective date: October 30, 2025
- Consolidated list includes 14+ securities under various IBC stages

## Regulatory Changes

The surveillance framework for companies under IBC continues with staged measures:

- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company regarding insolvency proceedings
- **Stage 1**: Additional Surveillance Measure for Companies relating to the Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP) as per IBC
- **Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance for companies in advanced insolvency stages

Securities under this framework face trading restrictions and enhanced monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the surveillance stage classification for affected securities
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in securities under IBC surveillance
- Investors should be aware of the insolvency status and associated risks
- Special notations apply: T+0 scrips marked with ~, Recommencement scrips marked with ^
- Alignment with NSE surveillance measures indicated by (*) notation

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 30, 2025 - Kobo Biotech Ltd enters Stage 1 surveillance
- **Circular Date**: October 29, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities under IBC surveillance face restricted trading conditions, reduced liquidity, and mandatory additional disclosures. Stage 1 classification indicates formal insolvency resolution process initiation.

**Investor Impact**: High risk for investors holding Kobo Biotech Ltd shares. IBC Stage 1 indicates the company is undergoing insolvency resolution, with significant uncertainty regarding recovery and business continuity.

**Market Impact**: Limited broader market impact as only one security added. However, the consolidated list shows 14+ companies under various IBC stages, indicating ongoing corporate distress monitoring by the exchange.

- A.F. Enterprises Ltd (Stage 1)
- Aban Offshore Ltd (Stage 0)
- AGS Transact Technologies Ltd (Stage 0)
