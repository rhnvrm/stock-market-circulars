---

## Summary

BSE has issued a notice suspending trading in Treasury Bill (T-bill) with ISIN IN002025Y057 (182T311025, Scrip Code 805059) effective October 29, 2025. The suspension is implemented as the T-bill is scheduled to mature on October 31, 2025 (Redemption Date). This is a standard operational procedure to prevent trading in securities approaching maturity.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension effective from October 29, 2025
- Maturity/Redemption date: October 31, 2025
- Trading members advised not to deal in this T-bill from suspension date
- Reference: DR-745/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard operational procedure for securities approaching maturity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealing in the specified T-bill (ISIN IN002025Y057) from October 29, 2025
- Members should update their systems to reflect the trading suspension
- No new trades should be executed in this security after the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 28, 2025
- **Trading Suspension Effective Date**: October 29, 2025
- **Maturity/Redemption Date**: October 31, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine suspension affecting a single T-bill prior to maturity. Treasury bills have defined maturity dates and such suspensions are standard practice in debt markets to ensure orderly settlement.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Trading members need to update their trading systems to block trades in this specific ISIN. The two-day notice period (October 28 notice for October 29 suspension) provides adequate time for system updates.

**Investor Impact**: Negligible. Investors holding this T-bill will receive redemption proceeds on the maturity date (October 31, 2025). No action required from investors as redemption is automatic.
