## Important Dates

- **December 10, 2025**: Notice issued

## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it pertains to a single mutual fund scheme's operational status. The reopening allows investors who were restricted during the suspension period to resume transactions in the NAVI NIFTY MIDSMALLCAP 400 INDEX FUND. The scheme tracks the NIFTY Midsmallcap 400 Index, providing exposure to mid and small-cap stocks. The availability of both Regular and Direct plan variants with full systematic transaction facilities (SIP/STP/SWP) provides flexibility to investors and distributors on the BSE StAR MF Platform.
