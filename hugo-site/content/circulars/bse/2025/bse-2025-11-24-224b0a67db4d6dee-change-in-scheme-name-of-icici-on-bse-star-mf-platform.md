title: Change in Scheme Name of ICICI Prudential Income Plus Arbitrage Active FOF
---

## Summary

ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company Limited has issued a notice-cum-addendum announcing the recategorization and name change of ICICI Prudential Income plus Arbitrage Active FOF. The scheme will be renamed to "ICICI Prudential Income plus Arbitrage Omni FOF" effective November 25, 2025. This change is made pursuant to the SEBI framework for Fund of Funds schemes and has been approved by ICICI Prudential Trust Limited (Trustee) and the AMC.

## Key Points

- **Old Scheme Name**: ICICI Prudential Income plus Arbitrage Active FOF
- **New Scheme Name**: ICICI Prudential Income plus Arbitrage Omni FOF
- **Scheme Type Change**: From "open ended fund of funds investing in Debt oriented and arbitrage schemes" to "open ended fund of funds investing in units of domestic active and passive debt oriented and arbitrage schemes"
- **Product Labelling Change**: From "Short Term Savings" to "Medium to Short Term Savings"
- **Investment Universe Expansion**: Scheme will now invest in both active and passive debt oriented schemes (previously only active schemes)
- **Asset Allocation**: Remains 95-100% in units of debt oriented and arbitrage schemes, 0-5% in money market instruments
- **Investment Objective**: Enhanced to include units of domestic active and passive debt oriented schemes

## Regulatory Changes

The recategorization is being implemented pursuant to the extant SEBI framework for Fund of Funds schemes. The changes align the scheme with current regulatory requirements for fund of funds categorization and allow investment in both active and passive underlying schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Addendum to Scheme Information Documents (SIDs) and Key Information Memorandums (KIMs) will be updated
- Existing unitholders will be notified of the scheme name and categorization changes
- The scheme will operate under the revised investment mandate from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 25, 2025
- All changes to scheme name, categorization, and investment mandate become effective from this date

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Minimal impact on existing unitholders as the core investment strategy remains focused on debt-oriented and arbitrage schemes. The expansion to include passive schemes provides additional flexibility to the fund manager.

**Operational Impact**: The scheme's asset allocation pattern remains largely unchanged (95-100% in underlying schemes, 0-5% in money market instruments). The primary change is the ability to invest in passive debt schemes alongside active schemes.

**Market Impact**: No significant market impact expected as this is an administrative recategorization of a single fund of funds scheme on the BSE StAR MF Platform.
