title: Resumption of Trading in Debentures of FINQUEST FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS PRIVATE
  LIMITED
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the resumption of trading in debentures of FINQUEST FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS PRIVATE LIMITED (Scrip Codes 955968 and 959019) effective August 08, 2025. Trading was previously suspended due to an early redemption process where the call option was ultimately not exercised by debenture holders.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension was related to early redemption process with record date July 10, 2025
- Call option for early redemption was not exercised by debenture holders
- Company has requested resumption of trading in both debenture series
- Trading will resume on August 08, 2025 under reference DR-691/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes involved - this is a routine trading resumption following completion of corporate action process.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are required to note the resumption of trading in the specified debentures from the effective date.

## Important Dates

- **Previous Record Date**: July 10, 2025 (for early redemption)
- **Trading Resumption Date**: August 08, 2025
- **Notice Date**: August 07, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this affects only specific debentures of one private company. The resumption allows normal trading to continue after the early redemption option period expired without exercise.
