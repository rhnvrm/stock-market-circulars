## Summary

Godrej Properties Ltd (GPL) has proposed amendments to the Debenture Trust Deed dated July 4, 2023 for Non-Convertible Debentures worth INR 1,500 Crore. The amendments involve deletion of five broad covenants from clauses 2.3(i), 2.3(iii), 2.3(viii), 2.3(xv)(b), and 2.3(xxiv)(c) of the Trust Deed. These covenants are being removed as they are open-ended in nature and the statutory auditor is unable to provide certification. The covenants will be incorporated into management representations instead. All changes have received approval from the Debenture Trustee.

## Impact Assessment

**For Debenture Holders:**
- The amendments are primarily procedural and administrative in nature
- Covenant obligations continue but shift from auditor-certified to management-represented format
- Debenture Trustee approval suggests no material adverse impact on debenture holder protections
- Transparency may be slightly reduced as management representations are less stringent than auditor-certified covenants

**For Godrej Properties:**
- Reduces compliance burden related to statutory auditor certification
- Addresses practical challenges with certifying broad, open-ended covenants
- Maintains substantive obligations through management representation mechanism
- Streamlines reporting and certification processes

**Market Impact:**
- Limited direct market impact as changes are technical and procedural
- May set precedent for other issuers facing similar auditor certification challenges
- Demonstrates ongoing evolution of debenture trustee deed practices in Indian markets
