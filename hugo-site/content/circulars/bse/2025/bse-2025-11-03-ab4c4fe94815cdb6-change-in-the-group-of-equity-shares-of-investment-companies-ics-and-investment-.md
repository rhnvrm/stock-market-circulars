## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The transition from trade-for-trade to normal trading will improve liquidity and ease trading restrictions for nine companies. These securities will no longer be subject to mandatory delivery requirements and call auction mechanisms.

**Market Implications**: Companies moving to Groups A and B will see normalized trading with standard settlement cycles. Group X placement indicates companies may have different trading or reporting requirements. The five companies remaining in trade-for-trade will continue to face trading restrictions, indicating ongoing concerns or regulatory surveillance.

**Investor Considerations**: Investors in the nine transitioning companies will benefit from improved trading flexibility and potentially better price discovery. Those holding securities in the five companies remaining under restrictions should be aware of continued limitations on trading activity.
