## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in debentures of Ahmedabad Ring Road Infrastructure Ltd (ARRIL) effective October 30, 2025. The suspension follows the company's decision to proceed with early full redemption of its 20% Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) with ISIN INE091I07011 (Scrip Code: 975947), which were originally scheduled to mature on June 30, 2026.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension effective from October 30, 2025
- Company: Ahmedabad Ring Road Infrastructure Ltd (ARRIL)
- Affected security: 20% NCDs with maturity date June 30, 2026
- ISIN: INE091I07011
- Scrip Code: 975947
- Reason: Early full redemption of debentures
- Notice Reference: DR-746/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a corporate action-driven trading suspension in accordance with standard BSE procedures for securities undergoing early redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the specified ARRIL debentures from October 30, 2025 onwards
- All exchange members are required to take note of this suspension
- Members should update their systems to reflect the trading restriction

## Important Dates

- **October 29, 2025**: Circular issued by BSE
- **October 30, 2025**: Trading suspension becomes effective
- **Original Maturity Date**: June 30, 2026 (now subject to early redemption)

## Impact Assessment

The suspension has limited market-wide impact as it affects only specific debenture holders of ARRIL. Early redemption is typically beneficial for investors as they receive their principal back sooner than expected along with accrued interest. Trading members holding positions in these debentures should prepare for the redemption process. The suspension prevents any further secondary market transactions, ensuring orderly settlement of the early redemption. Investors expecting long-term returns until 2026 will need to find alternative investment opportunities for the redeemed funds.
