title: Removal of Restriction on Subscription in Certain Schemes of Aditya Birla Sun
  Life Mutual Fund
---

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund has announced the removal of the maximum subscription limit of Rs. 10 crores per PAN per investor across all transactions for two of its schemes. This change takes effect from Monday, December 8, 2025, and applies to Aditya Birla Sun Life Medium Term Plan and Aditya Birla Sun Life Credit Risk Fund. The restriction removal allows investors to subscribe to these schemes without any upper limit constraints.

## Key Points

- Maximum subscription limit of Rs. 10 crores per PAN per investor removed
- Applies to Aditya Birla Sun Life Medium Term Plan
- Applies to Aditya Birla Sun Life Credit Risk Fund
- Effective date: Monday, December 8, 2025
- All other terms and conditions of the schemes remain unchanged
- Notice dated December 4, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

This addendum (No. 53/2025) modifies the subscription limits previously imposed on these two schemes. The removal of the Rs. 10 crore cap represents a liberalization of investment restrictions, allowing unlimited investment amounts per PAN. This forms an integral part of the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) for the affected schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- The notice-cum-addendum must be read as part of the SID and KIM
- Investors should review this addendum along with all previous addenda issued for these schemes
- All other features, terms, and conditions of the schemes remain as per the existing SID and KIM
- Standard mutual fund disclaimer applies: investments are subject to market risks

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 4, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 8, 2025 (Monday)

## Impact Assessment

The removal of the Rs. 10 crore subscription cap will primarily benefit high net worth individuals (HNIs) and institutional investors who wish to deploy larger amounts in these debt-oriented schemes. This change may lead to increased fund inflows and potentially larger asset under management (AUM) for both the Medium Term Plan and Credit Risk Fund. For the broader market, this could indicate improved liquidity conditions or increased confidence in the credit market segment. Retail investors are unlikely to be directly impacted as the previous limit was already quite high. The change enhances flexibility for large investors in portfolio allocation and debt market participation.
