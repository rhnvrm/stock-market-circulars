## Summary

Invesco Mutual Fund has announced the resumption of subscriptions in three overseas fund of fund schemes effective December 5, 2025. The temporary suspension was revoked after being imposed on October 9, 2025. The affected schemes are Invesco India - Invesco Global Equity Income Fund of Fund, Invesco India - Invesco Pan European Equity Fund of Fund, and Invesco India - Invesco Global Consumer Trends Fund of Fund. Subscriptions will be allowed only within available headroom without breaching overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022 at the Fund level.

## Key Points

- Three Invesco overseas fund of fund schemes to resume accepting subscriptions from December 5, 2025
- Subscription channels reopened: lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh SIP/STP/IDCW Transfer Plan registrations
- Subscriptions permitted only up to available headroom to comply with overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022
- AMC reserves right to temporarily suspend subscriptions again if overseas investments approach the limits
- Notice dated October 9, 2025 that imposed temporary suspension is now revoked
- All other terms and conditions of SIDs and KIMs remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements an operational decision to resume subscriptions in designated schemes while maintaining compliance with existing overseas investment limits established as of February 1, 2022.

## Compliance Requirements

- Fund house must monitor overseas investment levels to ensure they do not breach limits as of February 1, 2022
- AMC must suspend subscriptions if overseas investments approach regulatory limits
- This notice cum addendum must be treated as integral part of the Scheme Information Documents and Key Information Memorandums

## Important Dates

- **December 5, 2025**: Effective date for resumption of subscriptions in the three designated schemes
- **December 3, 2025**: Notice issuance date
- **October 9, 2025**: Date when temporary suspension was originally imposed (now revoked)
- **February 1, 2022**: Reference date for overseas investment limits

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited market-wide impact as this affects only three specific Invesco fund of fund schemes investing in overseas markets.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for investors interested in these three overseas fund of fund schemes who can now make fresh investments through various channels. However, subscriptions remain subject to headroom availability based on overseas investment limits.

**Operational Impact**: Fund house must actively monitor overseas investment levels and may need to temporarily suspend subscriptions again if limits are approached, creating potential uncertainty for investors planning systematic investments.

**Schemes Affected**:
1. Invesco India - Invesco Global Equity Income Fund of Fund
2. Invesco India - Invesco Pan European Equity Fund of Fund
3. Invesco India - Invesco Global Consumer Trends Fund of Fund
