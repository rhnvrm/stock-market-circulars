## Impact Assessment

This rights issue will dilute existing shareholding but provides existing shareholders the opportunity to maintain their proportional ownership by subscribing to additional shares. The 2:1 rights ratio significantly increases the company's share capital. Trading will be affected as shares will trade ex-rights from August 29, 2025, potentially impacting the stock price to reflect the rights value adjustment.
