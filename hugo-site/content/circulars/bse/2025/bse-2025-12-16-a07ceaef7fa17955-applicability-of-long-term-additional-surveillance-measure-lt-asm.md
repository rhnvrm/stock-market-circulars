## Summary

BSE has issued an update to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective December 17, 2025. Four securities have been newly added to the LT-ASM framework: CDG Petchem Ltd, East Buildtech Ltd, Vipul Ltd, and Vision Corporation Ltd. One security, Suyog Gurbaxani Funicular Ropeways Ltd, will move to a higher Stage II ASM. TV Vision Ltd is moving out of the LT-ASM framework due to inclusion in the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework.

## Key Points

- 4 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework (Part A)
- 1 security (Suyog Gurbaxani Funicular Ropeways Ltd) moving to higher Stage II ASM
- No securities moving to lower stage ASM
- No securities directly placed in Stage IV Long Term ASM
- 1 security (TV Vision Ltd) exiting LT-ASM due to ESM inclusion
- Consolidated list includes 14+ securities under various ASM stages
- Changes effective from December 17, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework continues to identify securities with abnormal price movements or trading patterns requiring enhanced surveillance. Securities under this framework face additional monitoring and potential trading restrictions to protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of securities under LT-ASM framework
- Enhanced due diligence required for client orders in LT-ASM securities
- Clients should be informed about the surveillance status of these securities
- Trading in these securities subject to additional surveillance parameters

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 17, 2025
- All changes to securities classification under LT-ASM framework become applicable from this date

## Impact Assessment

**Securities Added (Part A)**:
- CDG Petchem Ltd (Scrip Code: 534796, ISIN: INE198N01017)
- East Buildtech Ltd (Scrip Code: 507917, ISIN: INE706N01017)
- Vipul Ltd (Scrip Code: 511726, ISIN: INE946H01037)
- Vision Corporation Ltd (Scrip Code: 531668, ISIN: INE661D01015)

**Stage升级 (Part B)**:
- Suyog Gurbaxani Funicular Ropeways Ltd (Scrip Code: 543391, ISIN: INE07GA01011) - Moving to Stage II

**Securities Removed (Annexure II)**:
- TV Vision Ltd (Scrip Code: 540083, ISIN: INE871L01013) - Moving to ESM Framework

The inclusion in LT-ASM typically results in reduced liquidity, wider bid-ask spreads, and additional scrutiny on trading activities. Investors holding or trading these securities should exercise enhanced caution and be aware of the surveillance classification.
