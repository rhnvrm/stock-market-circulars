## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The listing adds approximately 3.98 crore partly paid-up shares to the market. As partly paid-up securities, these carry specific trading characteristics and risk profiles different from fully paid shares.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in these rights issue shares should be aware that:
- Only Rs. 0.5/- per share (25% of face value) is currently paid
- Additional calls totaling Rs. 15/- per share will be made by the Board at its discretion
- Dividend entitlement is proportionate to paid-up amount
- Non-payment of future calls may result in forfeiture of shares

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to accommodate the new scrip code, ISIN, and trading parameters for ATLPP in the B Group segment.
