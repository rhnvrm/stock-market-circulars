## Impact Assessment

This is a company-specific listing event with minimal market-wide impact. The preferential allotment of 97.50 lakh shares represents capital raised through warrant conversion. The lock-in periods ensure that approximately 47.69% of the newly issued shares (promoter quota) remain locked until June 2027, while 52.31% (non-promoter quota) will be locked until June 2026. This staged unlocking mechanism provides price stability. The listing increases the free float of Kay Power And Paper Ltd. but the immediate tradable quantity is limited to zero due to lock-in restrictions.
