## Impact Assessment

This is a routine commercial paper listing with minimal market impact. Commercial papers are standard short-term debt instruments used by corporates for working capital requirements. The listing provides additional liquidity options for investors in Reliance Industries' debt securities. The high credit ratings (A1+ from both CARE and CRISIL) indicate lowest credit risk for short-term instruments. The combined issuance of Rs. 1,300 crore represents normal treasury operations for a company of Reliance Industries' size. No impact on equity markets or broader trading operations is expected.
