title: Temporary Suspension of Subscription in Certain Schemes of HSBC Mutual Fund
---

## Summary

HSBC Mutual Fund has announced the temporary suspension of subscriptions in four schemes that invest in overseas securities, effective from close of business hours on December 3, 2025. This action is taken to comply with SEBI's overseas investment limits as specified in the letter dated June 17, 2022, which restricts AMCs from breaching the overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022 at the Fund level. The suspension affects lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh registrations of SIP, STP, and IDCW Transfer Plans.

## Key Points

- Temporary suspension of subscriptions in four HSBC Mutual Fund schemes investing in overseas securities
- Effective from close of business hours on December 3, 2025
- Suspension includes lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh SIP/STP/IDCW Transfer Plan registrations
- Affected schemes: HSBC Global Equity Climate Change Fund of Fund, HSBC Asia Pacific (Ex Japan) Dividend Yield Fund, HSBC Brazil Fund, and HSBC Global Emerging Markets Fund
- Applications received after 3:00 PM cut-off time on effective date will be rejected and refunded within 5 business days
- Switch-outs, redemptions, switch between plans/options, fresh SWP registrations, and existing SIP/STP/SWP/IDCW instalments remain unaffected
- Suspension will continue until SEBI/RBI enhances overseas investment limits or headroom increases

## Regulatory Changes

This action is based on SEBI's letter dated June 17, 2022, which permitted AMCs to make investments in overseas funds/securities only up to the headroom available without breaching the overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022 at the Fund level. The temporary suspension is a compliance measure to prevent potential breach of these regulatory limits.

## Compliance Requirements

- HSBC Asset Management must ensure all overseas investments remain within the prescribed limits
- Fresh applications received before the cut-off time of 3:00 PM on December 3, 2025 must have funds realized on or before the cut-off time
- Applications received after the cut-off time must be rejected with refunds processed within 5 business days
- Processing of existing SIP and IDCW Transfer Plan instalments in designated schemes will be reviewed based on available headroom
- The notice-cum-addendum forms an integral part of the SID and KIM of the Fund

## Important Dates

- **December 3, 2025**: Effective date of subscription suspension (close of business hours)
- **3:00 PM on December 3, 2025**: Cut-off time for accepting fresh applications with realized funds
- **Within 5 business days**: Refund period for rejected applications
- **Until further notice**: Duration of suspension (until SEBI/RBI enhances limits or headroom increases)

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: High - Investors cannot make new lumpsum investments, switch-ins, or register fresh SIPs/STPs in the four designated schemes. This limits investment options for those seeking overseas equity exposure through HSBC mutual funds. However, existing systematic plans will continue to be processed subject to available headroom.

**Market Impact**: Medium - This reflects broader industry-wide constraints on overseas investments faced by mutual funds due to SEBI/RBI limits. Other AMCs may face similar restrictions, potentially affecting investor sentiment toward international equity funds.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - The fund house must monitor overseas investment headroom continuously and review processing of existing instalments. Administrative processes must be established to reject and refund applications received after the effective date.

**Affected Schemes**:
1. HSBC Global Equity Climate Change Fund of Fund
2. HSBC Asia Pacific (Ex Japan) Dividend Yield Fund
3. HSBC Brazil Fund
4. HSBC Global Emerging Markets Fund

The suspension is temporary and will be lifted once regulatory limits are enhanced or sufficient headroom becomes available through redemptions or limit increases.
