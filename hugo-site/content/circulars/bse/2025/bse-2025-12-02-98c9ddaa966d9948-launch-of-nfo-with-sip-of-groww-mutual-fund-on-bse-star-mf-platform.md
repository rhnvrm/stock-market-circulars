## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine mutual fund NFO launch with no broader market implications. It expands investment options for BSE StAR MF Platform users interested in multi-asset fund-of-funds strategies.

**Operational Impact**: Medium for participating members - Members need to ensure proper fund management, client communication regarding payment timelines, and adherence to specific cutoff times for different transaction types (lumpsum vs SIP). The extended timeline for lumpsum purchases and strict SIP authentication deadline require operational coordination.

**Investor Impact**: Low to Medium - Provides new investment opportunity in multi-asset allocation through fund-of-funds structure with both regular and direct plan options. Investors must be aware of strict payment timelines and authentication requirements for SIP registrations to ensure successful allotment.
