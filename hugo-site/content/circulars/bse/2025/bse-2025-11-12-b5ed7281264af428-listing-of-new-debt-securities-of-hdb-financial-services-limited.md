## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt securities listing with minimal market impact. The listing provides institutional investors with additional fixed-income investment options from a highly-rated (AAA) issuer. The securities are for private placement only and will not affect retail trading activity. The high credit ratings (CARE AAA/Stable and CRISIL AAA/STABLE) indicate low default risk. As these are further listings under existing ISINs, they represent expansion of existing debt issues rather than new debt programs.
