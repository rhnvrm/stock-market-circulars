## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework is a surveillance measure applied to securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or other concerns. Securities under ESM may face additional margin requirements, price bands, or trading restrictions. Movement between ESM stages reflects changes in surveillance intensity based on the security's trading behavior.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised ESM classification for affected securities
- Enhanced margin requirements and other ESM-specific conditions will apply to securities entering or remaining in ESM framework
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new ESM status of these securities
- Investors should be aware that securities in ESM may have restricted liquidity and higher margin requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 15, 2025 - All ESM framework changes become effective

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Securities entering ESM will face enhanced surveillance with potential trading restrictions and higher margins, which may reduce liquidity
- Securities moving to higher ESM stages will face stricter surveillance measures
- Securities moving to lower ESM stages will see some relaxation in surveillance intensity
- Securities exiting ESM will have improved trading flexibility, though some will continue in Trade for Trade segment

**Investor Impact:**
- Investors holding securities entering ESM should expect reduced liquidity and higher margin requirements
- Exit from ESM for 25 securities may improve trading conditions and investor confidence
- Two securities (Aris International Ltd and Iconik Sports And Events Ltd) exiting ESM will continue in Trade for Trade as per circular dated November 27, 2025
