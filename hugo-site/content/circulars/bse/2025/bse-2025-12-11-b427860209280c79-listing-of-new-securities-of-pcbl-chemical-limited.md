## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The addition of 1.6 crore shares represents a significant increase in the equity base of PCBL Chemical Limited. However, since these shares are locked-in until June 2027, there will be no immediate impact on market supply or liquidity.

**Shareholding Impact**: The preferential allotment to promoters will increase promoter holding in the company, potentially strengthening promoter control. Investors should review updated shareholding patterns post-allotment.

**Dilution Impact**: Existing shareholders will experience dilution due to the issuance of new shares. The extent of dilution depends on the pre-issue share capital, which is not specified in this circular.

**Long-term Consideration**: The 2.5-year lock-in period provides stability in shareholding structure until mid-2027. Post lock-in expiry, these shares entering the market may impact supply dynamics.
