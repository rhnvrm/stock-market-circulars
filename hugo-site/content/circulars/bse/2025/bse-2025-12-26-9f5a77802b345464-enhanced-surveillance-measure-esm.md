## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective December 29, 2025. No new securities are being added to ESM, while 27 securities are exiting the framework entirely. Additionally, 3 securities are moving to higher ESM stages and 11 securities are moving to lower ESM stages, reflecting changes in their surveillance risk profiles.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework continues to be dynamically adjusted based on surveillance parameters. Securities can:
- Enter ESM framework when surveillance concerns arise
- Move between ESM stages based on risk assessment
- Exit ESM when concerns are adequately addressed or when moved to other frameworks (SMP, IBC)

## Compliance Requirements

- **For listed companies**: Securities moved to higher ESM stages will face stricter surveillance and potential additional disclosure requirements
- **For investors**: Trading in ESM securities may involve additional margins, price bands, or trade-for-trade requirements depending on the ESM stage
- **For brokers**: Update surveillance systems to reflect new ESM classifications and ensure appropriate client communication

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 29, 2025 - All ESM changes become applicable
- **Circular Date**: December 26, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact**: 27 securities exiting ESM will likely see improved liquidity and reduced trading restrictions, potentially positive for stock prices and investor sentiment. 11 securities moving to lower ESM stages will face reduced surveillance pressure.

**Negative Impact**: 3 securities moving to higher ESM stages will face stricter surveillance measures, potentially including higher margins, reduced liquidity, and negative investor sentiment.

**Market Integrity**: The ESM framework adjustments reflect BSE's ongoing efforts to maintain market integrity while allowing securities to graduate out of enhanced surveillance when appropriate. The net reduction in ESM-listed securities (27 exits vs 0 new entries) suggests improving market conditions for previously flagged securities.
