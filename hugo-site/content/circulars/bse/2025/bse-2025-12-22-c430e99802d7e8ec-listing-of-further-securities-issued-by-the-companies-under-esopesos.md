## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. ESOP/ESOS share listings are routine corporate actions with negligible impact on stock prices or trading volumes. Even the largest issuance (HDFC Bank's 2.07 million shares) represents a very small fraction of the bank's total equity base.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in floating stock for the 8 companies. The additional shares may provide minor liquidity enhancement.

**Dilution**: Minimal dilution for existing shareholders across all companies, as ESOP shares typically represent less than 1-2% of total equity.

**Investor Consideration**: This is informational for tracking purposes; no investment action required based solely on this circular.
