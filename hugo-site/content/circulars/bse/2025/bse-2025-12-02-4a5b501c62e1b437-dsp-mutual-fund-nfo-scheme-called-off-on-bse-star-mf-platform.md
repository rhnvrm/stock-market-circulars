---

## Summary

BSE has announced that DSP Mutual Fund has called off the DSP Fixed Maturity Plan (FMP) Series 277-789 Days NFO at the AMC level. All valid subscription orders reported to RTA with funds during the NFO period (November 27, 2025 to December 01, 2025) will be rejected with the remark "NFO Called Off". Refunds will be released to clients' registered bank accounts from the Exchange.

## Key Points

- DSP Fixed Maturity Plan (FMP) Series 277-789 Days NFO has been called off by DSP Mutual Fund
- The NFO was originally launched on November 26, 2025 (Notice No. 20251126-66)
- All subscription orders placed during November 27 - December 01, 2025 will be rejected
- Order status reports will show rejection remarks as "NFO Called Off"
- Refunds will be processed automatically to clients' registered bank accounts in UCCs

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational notification regarding the cancellation of a specific mutual fund NFO scheme.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members should note that all DSP FMP Series 277-789 Days NFO orders will be automatically rejected
- No action required from members as refunds will be processed automatically by the Exchange
- Members should inform affected clients about the NFO cancellation and refund process

## Important Dates

- **November 26, 2025**: Original NFO launch announcement (Notice No. 20251126-66)
- **November 27 - December 01, 2025**: NFO subscription period (now cancelled)
- **December 02, 2025**: NFO cancellation notice issued

## Impact Assessment

The cancellation affects investors who subscribed to the DSP FMP Series 277-789 Days during the NFO period. However, the impact is mitigated as automatic refunds will be processed to registered bank accounts. This is an isolated scheme-specific cancellation and does not indicate broader issues with BSE StAR MF Platform operations or DSP Mutual Fund's other schemes. Investors will need to seek alternative fixed maturity investment options if they were planning for the 789-day investment horizon.
