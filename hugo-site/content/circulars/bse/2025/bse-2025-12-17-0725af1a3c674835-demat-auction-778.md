## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 96 scrips across multiple sectors. While most quantities are small, large shortfalls in specific scrips like MANGALAM IND (10 million shares) and HINDUSTAN CO (50,000 shares) could create temporary price pressure during auction.

**Operational Impact:** Standard demat auction mechanism ensures orderly settlement of failed deliveries. Members with shortfalls face potential auction penalties and higher acquisition costs.

**Investor Impact:** Minimal direct impact on retail investors. The auction process ensures delivery obligations are met, maintaining settlement integrity in the market.
