## Summary

SEBI has mandated that all mutual fund investors must either designate a nominee or formally opt-out of nomination for their investments. This applies to both existing and new investors and requires proper authentication through OTP-based 2FA along with either a signed declaration or video verification. Starting December 15, 2025, transactions for fresh folio creation under non-demat mode without proper nomination compliance will be rejected at the AMC/RTA end.
