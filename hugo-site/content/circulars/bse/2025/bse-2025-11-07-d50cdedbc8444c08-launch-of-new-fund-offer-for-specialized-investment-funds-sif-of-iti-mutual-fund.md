## Impact Assessment

This is a routine mutual fund NFO launch with limited market impact. It provides investors access to a new equity long-short strategy through the SIF structure. The circular primarily affects mutual fund distributors, brokers using BSE StAR MF Platform, and investors interested in alternative equity strategies. The specialized nature of the fund may attract sophisticated investors looking for market-neutral or hedge fund-like strategies within the mutual fund framework. No impact on equity markets or specific stock prices.
