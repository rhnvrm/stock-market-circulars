## Summary

BSE has prohibited dealings in partly paid equity shares of Fusion Finance Limited (Scrip Code 890214) effective from November 11, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing the record date to identify shareholders eligible to receive the first and final call notice for payment of Rs. 65.50 per share (Rs. 5.00 face value + Rs. 60.50 premium).

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies only to partly paid equity shares (Scrip Code 890214)
- Record date fixed as November 11, 2025
- No dealings permitted from November 11, 2025 (Settlement DR-753/2025-2026)
- Call amount: Rs. 65.50 per share comprising Rs. 5.00 face value and Rs. 60.50 premium
- This is the first and final call on partly paid-up equity shares
- Trading members must take note and comply with the restriction

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action procedure for partly paid shares where trading is suspended to facilitate the call money collection process.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any deals in partly paid equity shares of Fusion Finance Limited from November 11, 2025
- Trading members are required to inform their clients holding partly paid shares about the suspension
- Shareholders of partly paid shares must respond to the call notice when received

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 7, 2025
- **Record Date**: November 11, 2025
- **No Dealings From**: November 11, 2025
- **Settlement Number**: DR-753/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact** - Shareholders holding partly paid equity shares will be unable to trade these securities from November 11, 2025. They must prepare to pay the call money of Rs. 65.50 per share upon receiving the call notice. Failure to pay may result in forfeiture of shares. Trading members must ensure no transactions are executed in these securities to avoid settlement issues.
