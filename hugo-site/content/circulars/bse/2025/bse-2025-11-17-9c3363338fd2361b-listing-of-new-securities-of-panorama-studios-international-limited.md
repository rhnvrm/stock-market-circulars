## Impact Assessment

This is a routine preferential allotment listing with minimal immediate market impact. The 35 lakh shares represent promoter holdings from warrant conversion and are completely locked-in for approximately 19 months from the listing date. Since these shares cannot be traded until mid-2027, there will be no immediate supply pressure on the stock. The allotment strengthens promoter stake and the shares rank equally with existing equity shares of the company.
