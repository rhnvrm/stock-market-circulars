## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited. This is a routine suspension affecting maturing debt securities. Investors holding these instruments will receive redemption proceeds as per standard settlement procedures.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to block trading in these four ISINs. No significant operational disruption expected as this is a standard end-of-life process for debt instruments.

**Investor Impact**: Holders of these securities will not be able to trade them from November 3, 2025, but will receive redemption payments on the maturity date. No adverse impact for investors who plan to hold until maturity.
