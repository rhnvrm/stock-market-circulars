## Securities Exiting LT-ASM Framework

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework is a surveillance mechanism designed to alert investors about securities showing abnormal price movements or other risk characteristics. Securities placed under this framework are subject to additional trading restrictions and margin requirements to ensure market integrity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors and traders must be aware of enhanced surveillance measures applicable to these securities
- Trading in LT-ASM securities may be subject to additional margin requirements
- Price bands and other trading restrictions may apply as per ASM stage
- Market participants should review the consolidated list in Annexure III for complete ASM coverage

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 07, 2025 - All changes to LT-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of securities in the LT-ASM framework indicates heightened surveillance and is intended to protect investors from excessive volatility. For the 8 newly added securities, investors can expect:

- Increased margin requirements for trading
- Potential liquidity constraints
- Enhanced monitoring by the exchange
- Additional disclosure requirements from listed companies

The exit of Shri Keshav Cements And Infra Ltd from the framework suggests improved compliance or market behavior. Axiscades Technologies Ltd being placed directly in Stage IV indicates significant surveillance concerns requiring immediate heightened oversight.
