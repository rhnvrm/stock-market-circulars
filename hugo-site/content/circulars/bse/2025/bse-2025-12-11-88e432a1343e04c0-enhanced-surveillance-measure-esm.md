Investors holding these securities may face challenges in executing trades. The framework is designed to protect investor interests by flagging securities with unusual price movements or other concerns.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders of newly added securities should be aware of potential liquidity constraints. Enhanced surveillance indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence before trading in ESM securities.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to update their systems and client communications regarding ESM securities. Additional monitoring and compliance procedures must be implemented for affected scrips.
