---

## Summary

BSE has announced corporate actions for 23 companies in the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) segment. All corporate actions are dividend distributions with corresponding book closure dates, ex-dates, and shut periods scheduled throughout September 2025. The shut periods typically span 1-3 days around the ex-date, during which SLB transactions in these securities will be restricted.

## Key Points

- 23 companies have announced dividend distributions with ex-dates ranging from September 4-23, 2025
- All corporate actions are dividend payments requiring book closure and ex-date processing
- Shut periods for SLB transactions span 1-3 days around each ex-date
- Earliest ex-date: September 4, 2025 (Supriya Lifescience Limited)
- Latest ex-date: September 23, 2025 (Mold-Tek Packaging Limited)
- Major companies included: Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, National Aluminium Co., RBL Bank

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This circular follows standard procedures for corporate actions in SLB securities as per existing SEBI guidelines.

## Compliance Requirements

- SLB participants must close all open positions in affected securities before the shut period begins
- Market participants cannot initiate new SLB transactions during the shut period
- Clearing members must ensure settlement of all existing SLB positions before book closure dates
- Borrowers must return securities or roll over positions before the shut period commences

## Important Dates

- September 3-5, 2025: Supriya Lifescience (shut period)
- September 8-9, 2025: Gujarat State Fertilizers & RBL Bank (shut period)
- September 11-12, 2025: Multiple companies including Gujarat Industries Power, K.P. Energy, Mastek, Kajaria Ceramics, JTL Industries
- September 12-15, 2025: Glenmark Pharmaceuticals (shut period)
- September 18-20, 2025: Multiple companies including National Aluminium, Mazagon Dock, Vinati Organics, HI-TECH Pipes
- September 22-23, 2025: Mold-Tek Packaging (shut period)

## Impact Assessment

The corporate actions will temporarily restrict SLB activity in 23 securities during their respective shut periods. This may impact liquidity in the SLB segment and require position adjustments by market participants. Borrowers holding positions in these securities must plan for early closure or rollover to avoid forced buy-ins. The staggered timing of shut periods throughout September should minimize concentrated market impact.
