## Important Dates

- **17 December 2025**: Circular issue date
- **19 December 2025**: Record date for demerger entitlement
- **19 December 2025**: Ex-entitlement date (Settlement DR-781/2025-2026)
- **19 December 2025**: Transfer to T group effective date

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact (High)**: Existing shareholders will see their single holding in DCM Shriram Industries transformed into holdings in three separate entities - the original company plus two new resulting companies. Each shareholder receives equal number of shares in both resulting companies, maintaining proportional ownership.

**Trading Impact (High)**: Movement to T group restricts trading to once a week on specific days with price bands, significantly reducing liquidity. SPOS on record date means special call auction procedures apply. Normal trading will resume after corporate action completion.

**Market Impact (Medium-High)**: The demerger separates two distinct business verticals (Chemicals and Rayon), potentially unlocking value by allowing each business to be valued independently. Institutional and retail investors will need to reassess investment thesis for three separate entities instead of one integrated company.

**Operational Impact (High)**: Corporate action teams at brokers, depositories, and custodians must process the 1:1:1 share allotment accurately. Two new ISINs will be created for the resulting companies, requiring system updates and reconciliation processes.
