## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Moderate impact limited to debenture holders of Muthoot Microfin Limited. The 75% reduction in face value (from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 25,000) indicates a substantial part redemption, returning capital to investors while keeping the debentures active until maturity on July 7, 2026.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders on record date will receive partial redemption proceeds along with accrued interest. Post-redemption, the investment amount per debenture reduces significantly, which may affect portfolio allocations and interest income calculations.

**Trading Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to reflect the reduced face value from December 16, 2025. All post-redemption trading will occur at the new face value, affecting transaction sizes and calculations.
