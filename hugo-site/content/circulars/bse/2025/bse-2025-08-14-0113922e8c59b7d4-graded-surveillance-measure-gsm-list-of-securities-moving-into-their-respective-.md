---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework, announcing the movement of 9 securities across different GSM stages. Three securities have moved to GSM Stage 0 due to their inclusion in the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework.

## Key Points

- 9 securities affected by GSM stage changes
- 3 securities moved to Stage 0 due to ESM framework inclusion
- 2 securities moved to Stage I
- 1 security each moved to Stages II, III, and IV
- 2 additional securities moved to Stage IV

## Securities Movement Details

**Moving to Stage 0 (ESM Framework):**
- Polymac Thermoformers Ltd (537573)
- Avi Products India Ltd (523896)
- Ashutosh Paper Mills Ltd (531568)

**Moving to Stage I:**
- Rajkamal Synthetics Ltd (514028)
- V R Films & Studios Limited (542654)

**Moving to Stage IV:**

## Regulatory Changes

Securities marked with (#) are moving to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in the ESM Framework, indicating enhanced surveillance measures beyond the standard GSM structure.

## Impact Assessment

The GSM stage movements will result in varying levels of trading restrictions and surveillance measures for the affected securities. Securities moving to higher GSM stages face increased monitoring and potential trading limitations, while those moving to Stage 0 will be subject to ESM framework requirements.
