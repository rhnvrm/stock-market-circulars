title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective September 10, 2025. The circular adds 15 new securities to the ST-ASM framework while removing 7 securities. The ST-ASM framework imposes enhanced surveillance on securities showing unusual price movements or volumes.

## Key Points

- 15 securities newly added to Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework
- 7 securities moving out of the ST-ASM Framework
- No securities being moved to higher or lower stage ASM within the framework
- Some securities moving out due to inclusion in other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM)
- Framework includes both regular securities and SME scrips
- T+0 scrips included based on parent company classification

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to operate with its existing structure of 5/15/30 days surveillance periods. Securities under this framework are subject to enhanced monitoring and may have trading restrictions or additional margin requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of securities under ST-ASM framework
- Enhanced due diligence required for trading in listed securities
- Compliance with any additional margin or trading restrictions
- Monitoring of price and volume movements in these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: September 10, 2025
- All changes to the ST-ASM framework take effect from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 15 securities to the ST-ASM framework indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny on these stocks due to unusual trading patterns. Investors and traders should exercise caution when dealing with these securities as they may be subject to additional compliance requirements and trading restrictions. The removal of 7 securities suggests normalization of trading behavior or transfer to other surveillance mechanisms.
