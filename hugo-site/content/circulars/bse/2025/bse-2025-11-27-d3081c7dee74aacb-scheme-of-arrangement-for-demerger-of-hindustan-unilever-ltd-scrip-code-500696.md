## Important Dates

- **November 27, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **December 5, 2025**: Record Date for determining shareholder entitlement
- **December 5, 2025**: Ex-Entitlement Date (Settlement DR-771/2025-2026)
- **December 5, 2025**: Special Pre-open Session (SPOS) for Hindustan Unilever Ltd
- **Post-compliance**: Listing of Kwality Wall's (India) Limited equity shares on BSE (subject to formalities)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - This is a significant corporate restructuring of one of India's largest FMCG companies. The 1:1 share ratio means all Hindustan Unilever shareholders will automatically become shareholders of the new entity. The Special Pre-open Session on December 5, 2025 will establish price discovery for the post-demerger Hindustan Unilever stock.

**Shareholder Impact:** All equity shareholders holding shares as of December 5, 2025 will receive equivalent shares in Kwality Wall's (India) Limited at no additional cost. This creates a new investment in their portfolio representing the demerged ice cream business.

**Trading Impact:** Hindustan Unilever will trade ex-entitlement from December 5, 2025, and the stock price is expected to adjust to reflect the separation of the ice cream business. The SPOS mechanism will help establish fair price discovery post-demerger.

**Operational Impact:** The demerger separates a distinct business vertical, allowing focused management and potentially unlocking shareholder value through separate listing of the ice cream business under Kwality Wall's (India) Limited.
