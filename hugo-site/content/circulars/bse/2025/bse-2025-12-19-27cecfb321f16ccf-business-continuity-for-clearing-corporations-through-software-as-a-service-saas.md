All ICCL clearing members are required to participate and test the functionality. The SaaS instance will be invoked at approximately 2:00 PM, after which members will not be able to log in to the RTRMS system and must use the ICCL@NCL instance for N-MASS, CIM, and NCMS.exe with their existing credentials.

## Key Points

- All ICCL clearing members must participate in testing
- After invocation, RTRMS system login will be unavailable; members must use ICCL@NCL instance
- Login credentials previously provided to members remain valid
- Two SaaS links provided: CIM (cash deposit) and NMASS (position and collateral allocation)

## Important Dates

- **December 20, 2025**: Mock session for testing Two-way SaaS portability
- **Approximately 2:00 PM on December 20, 2025**: SaaS instance ICCL@NCL invocation time

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - All ICCL clearing members will experience a mandatory system transition during the mock session. Regular RTRMS access will be unavailable after 2:00 PM, requiring members to switch to the SaaS instance.

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a scheduled mock session for business continuity testing with no direct impact on trading or settlement operations.

**Member Impact**: Medium - Clearing members must ensure their teams are prepared to test the SaaS functionality and access systems through alternative links. Successful participation is critical for validating disaster recovery capabilities.

**Technical Impact**: Members need to verify they can access and operate through the SaaS instance URLs and that their existing credentials work properly in the ICCL@NCL environment across all relevant systems (N-MASS, CIM, NCMS.exe).
