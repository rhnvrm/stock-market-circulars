## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is a clarification of publicly available news about routine business expansion. The company explicitly states the investment does not meet materiality thresholds, indicating it is not expected to significantly affect the company's financial position or operations. The expansion strengthens Syngene's biologics capabilities in the ADC space, which may have positive long-term strategic implications for the company's service offerings in the pharmaceutical contract research and manufacturing sector. No immediate trading or operational impact on other market participants.
