## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The addition of 35,088 shares represents a small increment to the existing float of Apollo Micro Systems Limited and is unlikely to have material impact on stock liquidity or price.

**Operational Impact:** None. This is a standard listing procedure with no changes to trading systems or market operations.

**Investor Impact:** Low. The shares are locked in for approximately 6 months until July 2026, so they will not be available for trading in the secondary market during this period. The preferential issue to non-promoters may marginally increase public shareholding.
