title: Non-Business Day for certain schemes of Mutual Fund on BSE StAR MF Platform
  - UPDATE
---

## Summary

BSE has notified non-business days for certain mutual fund schemes on its StAR MF Platform for November 2025. Bandhan US Treasury Bond 0-1 year Fund of Fund will be closed on November 11, 2025. Four Invesco fund of funds schemes will observe non-business days on both November 11 and November 27, 2025.

## Key Points

- Bandhan US Treasury Bond 0-1 year Fund of Fund will not operate on November 11, 2025
- Four Invesco fund of funds schemes will be closed on November 11, 2025
- The same four Invesco schemes will also be closed on November 27, 2025
- Affected Invesco schemes: Invesco Pan European Equity FoF, Invesco Global Equity Income FoF, Invesco Global Consumer Trends FoF, and Invesco EQQQ Nasdaq-100 ETF FoF
- These are likely foreign market holidays affecting fund of funds that invest in international markets

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is an operational notification.

## Compliance Requirements

Investors and intermediaries should note that transactions in the specified schemes will not be processed on the designated non-business days. Alternative arrangements should be made for any time-sensitive transactions.

## Important Dates

- **November 11, 2025**: Non-business day for Bandhan US Treasury Bond 0-1 year FoF and all four Invesco fund of funds schemes
- **November 27, 2025**: Non-business day for all four Invesco fund of funds schemes

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this affects only specific international fund of funds schemes. Investors in these schemes should plan transactions accordingly to avoid the non-business days. The closures likely correspond to public holidays in the United States and European markets where the underlying funds are domiciled.
