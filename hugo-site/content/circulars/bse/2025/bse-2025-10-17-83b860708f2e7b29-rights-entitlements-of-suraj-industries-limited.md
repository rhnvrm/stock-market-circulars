**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and client communication processes to handle RE trading for this specific security. The T+1 settlement cycle requires operational readiness for quick turnaround.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders have the opportunity to monetize their rights through renunciation if they choose not to participate in the rights issue. Clear communication requirements protect investors from confusion between REs and ordinary shares.
