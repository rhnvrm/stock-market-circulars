## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine listing notification for shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS schemes as per SEBI regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are informed of the new securities available for trading. No specific compliance actions required beyond normal trading operations.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 19, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: Thursday, November 20, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The quantities being listed represent a small fraction of the outstanding shares for these large-cap companies. For example, HDFC Bank's 3.08 million shares and ICICI Bank's 1.27 million shares are negligible compared to their total market capitalization.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in floating stock for all companies listed.

**Investor Impact**: No material impact on existing shareholders. These are routine ESOP/ESOS conversions that are expected corporate actions for companies with employee incentive programs.
