## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. ESOP/ESOS issuances are routine corporate actions with minimal immediate market impact. The shares represent employee compensation and typically have limited trading volume initially.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible to low. While 4.5 million shares are being added, they are distributed across 12 companies. IDFC FIRST Bank's 3.9 million share issuance represents approximately 0.035% dilution based on typical outstanding shares.

**Dilution Impact:** Minimal for most companies except potentially Aditya Infotech (323,135 shares) and Go Digit General Insurance (354,609 shares) depending on their existing share base.

**Investor Consideration:** No immediate action required. Investors should note the increased share count for calculation of earnings per share and market capitalization metrics.
