title: Companies Clarify Market Speculation - Vodafone Idea and Shree Digvijay Cement
---

## Summary

Two BSE-listed companies issued clarifications regarding news articles that caused material price movements. Vodafone Idea Limited responded to reports about government telecom relief being ruled out, while Shree Digvijay Cement Company Limited denied speculation about Adani Group's interest in their assets.

## Key Points

- Vodafone Idea shares fell 10% following news about MoS Telecom ruling out further government relief
- Company confirms no communication received from government on the reported matter
- Shree Digvijay Cement denies awareness of any Adani Group acquisition interest
- Both companies emphasize compliance with disclosure requirements under SEBI regulations
- Price movements attributed to market speculation rather than material developments

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes mentioned in these clarifications.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must provide clarifications on news articles causing material price impact
- Disclosure obligations under Regulation 30(11) of SEBI Listing Regulations must be met
- All price sensitive information must be disclosed as per SEBI LODR 2015

## Important Dates

- August 26, 2025: Date of news articles and company responses
- August 25, 2025: Date of BSE inquiry to Shree Digvijay Cement

## Impact Assessment

Both clarifications aim to address market speculation and volatility. Vodafone Idea's 10% decline reflects investor concerns about government support, while Shree Digvijay Cement's response seeks to counter acquisition rumors. The clarifications provide transparency but may not immediately stabilize share prices as underlying market concerns remain unaddressed.
