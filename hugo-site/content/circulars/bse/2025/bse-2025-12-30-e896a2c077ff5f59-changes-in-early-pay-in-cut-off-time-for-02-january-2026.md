title: Changes in Early Pay-in Cut-off Time for 02-January-2026
---

## Summary

Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd (ICCL) has issued revised timelines for Early Pay-in (EPI) activities specifically for 02-January-2026. The changes significantly advance the final cut-off times for both EPI of Funds and EPI of Securities to 7:00 PM, while extending the Collateral Allocation cut-off to 10:00 PM. These temporary modifications are made in reference to SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/DOP/P/CIR/2022/10 dated July 27, 2022, regarding settlement of running account of client's funds.

## Key Points

- EPI of Funds final cut-off time advanced from 7:45 PM to 7:00 PM (45 minutes earlier)
- EPI of Securities final cut-off time advanced from 9:00 PM to 7:00 PM (2 hours earlier)
- Collateral Allocation cut-off time extended from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM (2 hours later)
- Margin reports download time advanced from 10:30 PM to 8:45 PM (1 hour 45 minutes earlier)
- Changes apply only to 02-January-2026
- Reference to original circular ICCL no. 20200829-4 dated August 29, 2020

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements temporary timeline modifications in accordance with:
- SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/DOP/P/CIR/2022/10 dated July 27, 2022
- ICCL circular no. 20200829-4 dated August 29, 2020

The changes represent operational adjustments to settlement timelines rather than permanent regulatory framework modifications.

## Compliance Requirements

**Trading Members must:**
- Complete EPI of Funds by 7:00 PM on 02-January-2026 (instead of usual 7:45 PM)
- Complete EPI of Securities by 7:00 PM on 02-January-2026 (instead of usual 9:00 PM)
- Complete Collateral Allocation by 10:00 PM (extended from usual 8:00 PM)

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date:** December 30, 2025
- **Effective Date:** January 02, 2026 (one-day implementation)
- **EPI Funds & Securities Cut-off:** 7:00 PM on 02-January-2026
- **Collateral Allocation Cut-off:** 10:00 PM on 02-January-2026
- **Margin Reports Download:** 8:45 PM on 02-January-2026

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members and custodians must expedite their settlement processes by 45 minutes to 2 hours
- Limited preparation time as circular issued on December 30 for January 02 implementation
- Requires immediate coordination between trading members, custodians, and back-office teams

**Market Impact:**
- Affects all market participants involved in settlement activities
- May require temporary adjustments to operational workflows and resource allocation
- Extended collateral allocation window provides additional flexibility for margin management

**Risk Considerations:**
- Tight timeline for implementation may increase operational risks
- Members need to ensure adequate staffing and system readiness for earlier deadlines
- Failure to meet revised cut-offs could impact settlement obligations

The earlier margin report availability (8:45 PM vs 10:30 PM) provides members with earlier visibility of their margin requirements, potentially offsetting some operational challenges of the earlier EPI deadlines.
