## Regulatory Framework

The Short Term ASM framework is a surveillance mechanism applied to securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or excessive volatility over short periods (5/15/30 days). Securities under this framework face additional trading restrictions designed to curb excessive speculation.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of securities under ST-ASM and inform clients
- Enhanced margin requirements apply to securities in ST-ASM framework
- Trading restrictions as per ASM stage requirements are applicable
- Market participants should note securities moving between different surveillance frameworks

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 19, 2025
- Changes to ST-ASM applicability commence from this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 18 securities with potential impact on liquidity and trading activity. Securities newly added to ST-ASM may experience reduced trading volumes due to higher margins and surveillance measures.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to update their systems and client communications regarding the surveillance status of affected securities. Securities moving to LT-ASM will face different surveillance parameters requiring operational adjustments.
