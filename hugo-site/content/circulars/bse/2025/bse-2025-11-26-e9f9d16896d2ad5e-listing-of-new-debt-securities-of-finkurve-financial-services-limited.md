This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it involves privately placed debt securities with limited liquidity. The securities are relevant primarily to:

- Institutional investors who participated in the private placement
- Debt market participants seeking BBB-rated corporate bonds
- Investors looking for monthly income instruments with 11.15-11.25% yields

The higher coupon rates (11.15% and 11.25%) reflect the BBB credit rating and current market conditions for non-banking finance company debt. Trading members requiring clarification may contact BSE's debt department.
