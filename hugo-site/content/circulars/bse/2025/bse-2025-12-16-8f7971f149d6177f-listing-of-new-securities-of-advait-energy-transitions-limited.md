## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The small number of shares (1,408) issued through warrant conversion represents a negligible addition to the company's equity base. The lock-in period until June 29, 2026 ensures these shares will not immediately affect market liquidity. Trading members should update their records accordingly, but no significant operational or market changes are expected.
