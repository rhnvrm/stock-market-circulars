## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects 118 securities but quantities are relatively small for most scrips, limiting overall market impact. Large-cap stocks like Reliance (100 shares) and Axis Bank (379 shares) have minimal quantities relative to daily volumes.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - participants with delivery failures must arrange funds for auction purchases at potentially unfavorable prices. Members with obligations in multiple securities face higher operational burden.

**Liquidity Impact:** Low to Medium - auction volumes are small compared to normal trading volumes for most listed securities. Exception is smaller/illiquid stocks where auction quantities may represent significant percentage of daily volume.

**Member Impact:** Members who failed to deliver must participate in auction, bearing price risk and additional costs. This serves as deterrent against settlement failures.
