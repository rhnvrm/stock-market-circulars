## Impact Assessment

This corporate action has minimal market-wide impact as it affects only holders of a specific debenture series from a private limited company. The part redemption results in a reduction of outstanding principal, with the face value decreasing to Rs. 12,500 per debenture. Debenture holders will receive partial principal repayment along with accrued interest. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the reduced face value from the effective date. The debenture continues to trade in the debt segment until its maturity on February 27, 2026.
