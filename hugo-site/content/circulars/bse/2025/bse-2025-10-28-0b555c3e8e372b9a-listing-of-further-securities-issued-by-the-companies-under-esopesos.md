## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative listing with minimal market impact. The shares represent employee compensation conversions and are relatively small in quantity compared to the existing paid-up capital of these companies. With no lock-in restrictions, the shares are immediately tradable, though given their origin as employee stock options, immediate selling pressure is typically limited. The largest single issuance is Artemis Medicare with 306,000 shares, while major banks like ICICI and AXIS Bank have relatively small additions that will not materially affect their floating stock.
