## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine NFO launch for a passive index fund tracking NIFTY MIDCAP 150. It provides investors with another investment option in the midcap segment but does not affect overall market operations.

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium for BSE StAR MF platform members - Standard NFO processing requirements apply. Members need to ensure compliance with fund collection timelines and client transaction processing deadlines. The extended midnight trading window for lumpsum purchases provides additional flexibility.

**Investor Impact**: Positive - Offers new investment opportunity in midcap index segment with both regular and direct plan options, catering to different investor preferences for dividend and growth strategies.
