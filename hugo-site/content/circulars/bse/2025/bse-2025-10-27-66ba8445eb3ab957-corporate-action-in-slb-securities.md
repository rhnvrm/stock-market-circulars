- Market participants must monitor shut period schedules: earliest starting October 24, 2025, latest ending November 19, 2025
- Trading members must ensure clients are informed of foreclosure requirements

## Important Dates

**Immediate Action Required (October 2025):**
- October 27, 2025: Ex-date and shut period end for REC Limited, Tanla Platforms, L&T Technology Services, Infosys, CESC, 360 ONE WAM, CRISIL, Central Bank of India, PCBL Chemical

**Anomaly:**
- Symphony Limited: Ex-date August 7, 2025 (appears to be historical/reference data)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - affects 30 actively traded securities including several large-cap and blue-chip stocks with significant SLB activity. The shut periods will reduce available floating stock for lending/borrowing during peak corporate action season.

**Operational Impact:** High - SLB participants must manage foreclosure of multiple positions across different dates, requiring careful coordination and risk management. Amalgamation events for Dhani Services and Mangalore Chemicals require complete position closure.

**Liquidity Impact:** Medium to High - temporary reduction in SLB liquidity for affected securities during shut periods. Major stocks like Infosys, HUL, and Power Grid could see constrained short-selling activity.

**Risk Considerations:** Participants failing to foreclose positions timely may face regulatory action and operational disruptions. The concentrated timeline with multiple securities having ex-dates in late October/early November requires enhanced monitoring.
