(Exchange Ticker: 544429), LG Electronics India Ltd. (Exchange Ticker: 544576), and Tata Capital Ltd. (Exchange Ticker: 544574). No stocks are being dropped from any of the indices in this reconstitution.

## Key Points

- HDB Financial Services Ltd. will be added to BSE Allcap, BSE MidCap, BSE LargeMidCap, BSE MidSmallCap, and BSE Financial Services indices
- LG Electronics India Ltd. will be added to BSE Allcap, BSE LargeCap, BSE LargeMidCap, and BSE Consumer Discretionary indices
- Tata Capital Ltd. will be added to BSE Allcap, BSE LargeCap, BSE LargeMidCap, and BSE Financial Services indices
- Changes are based on methodology notice no. 20251029-21
- No stocks are being removed from any indices

## Regulatory Changes

This reconstitution follows the methodology changes outlined in BSE notice no. 20251029-21 dated October 29, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Index fund managers and passive investment vehicles tracking these indices must rebalance their portfolios to reflect the new constituents
- Market participants should note the effective date for any trading or portfolio adjustments
- Queries should be directed to bseindex@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 25, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 02, 2025 (at market open on Tuesday)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of three large companies to multiple indices is expected to generate buying interest from index-tracking funds and passive investment vehicles. Since no stocks are being dropped, there will be no selling pressure from index rebalancing.

**Operational Impact**: Fund managers tracking these indices will need to purchase shares of the three companies in proportion to their index weights. The inclusion of HDB Financial Services in mid-cap focused indices, and LG Electronics India and Tata Capital in large-cap focused indices indicates these companies have achieved sufficient market capitalization and liquidity thresholds.

**Sector Impact**: The additions strengthen representation of the financial services sector (HDB Financial Services and Tata Capital) and consumer discretionary sector (LG Electronics India) in BSE indices.
