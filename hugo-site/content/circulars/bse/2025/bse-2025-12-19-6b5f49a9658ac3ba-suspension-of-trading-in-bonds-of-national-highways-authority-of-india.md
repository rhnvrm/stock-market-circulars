- **Record Date**: December 26, 2025
- **No Dealings From**: December 26, 2025
- **Bond Maturity**: January 11, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of this specific NHAI bond series. As the bonds are approaching maturity (January 11, 2026), this suspension is a routine administrative measure for final redemption processing.

**Investor Impact**: Bondholders on record as of December 26, 2025 will receive the final interest payment and principal redemption. Secondary market trading will not be possible from the suspension date, but this is expected given the imminent maturity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure trading systems prevent any transactions in this security and communicate the suspension to affected clients holding these bonds.
