**Contract Adjustments**:

1. **Strike Prices**: Will be divided by 5
   - Example: Strike of 3100 becomes 620, 3200 becomes 640, 3300 becomes 660, 3400 becomes 680

2. **Market Lot**: Will be multiplied by 5
   - Current lot size: 150
   - Revised lot size: 750 (150 × 5)

3. **Positions**: Will be multiplied by 5
   - Traders holding positions will see quantity increase by factor of 5

4. **Futures Price**: Will be divided by 5 and rounded to nearest tick size

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems, risk management systems, and margin calculations will need to reflect the adjusted contract specifications immediately after December 4, 2025. The total contract value remains economically equivalent despite the numerical adjustments.
