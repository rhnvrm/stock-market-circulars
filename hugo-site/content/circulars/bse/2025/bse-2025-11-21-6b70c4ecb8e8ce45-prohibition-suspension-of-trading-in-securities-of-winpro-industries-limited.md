- Suspension applies to all securities of Winpro Industries Limited

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - Complete trading halt prevents price discovery and liquidity for existing shareholders. Investors with holdings are unable to exit positions.

**Investor Impact:** Severe - Shareholders face complete illiquidity with no ability to sell holdings. Indicates serious governance and compliance issues at the company.

**Compliance Significance:** The non-existence at registered office address combined with non-responsiveness to exchange communications represents fundamental violations of listing obligations, suggesting potential company abandonment or fraud.
