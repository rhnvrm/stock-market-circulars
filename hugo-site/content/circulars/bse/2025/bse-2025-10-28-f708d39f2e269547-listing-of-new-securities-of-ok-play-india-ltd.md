## Important Dates

- **October 28, 2025**: Notice date
- **October 29, 2025**: Trading commencement date
- **January 9, 2025**: First allotment date (50,00,000 shares)
- **June 27, 2025**: Second allotment date (50,00,000 shares)
- **April 30, 2026**: Lock-in expiry date for all shares

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of preferentially allotted shares following warrant conversion. The dilution is limited to 1 crore shares with a lock-in period extending until April 2026, which restricts immediate market supply.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new securities and associated lock-in provisions. The preferential allotment to non-promoters increases the public float but with restricted liquidity until lock-in expiry.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution from the preferential issue, though the lock-in period provides some stability. The issue price of Rs. 13.50 per share provides a reference point for valuation.
