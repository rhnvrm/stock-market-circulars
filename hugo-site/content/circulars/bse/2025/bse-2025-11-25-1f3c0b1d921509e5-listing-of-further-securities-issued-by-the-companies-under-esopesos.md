- The newly issued shares will be available for trading from November 26, 2025

- **Notice Date:** November 25, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date:** November 26, 2025
- **Lock-in Period:** None applicable (NA for all companies)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The ESOP issuances represent routine corporate actions for employee compensation and retention programs. The number of shares being listed is relatively small compared to the existing float of these companies.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible short-term impact on liquidity as ESOP shares are typically held by employees and not immediately sold in the market.

**Investor Impact:** No material impact on existing shareholders. ESOP issuances may cause minor dilution but this is a planned and disclosed corporate action.

**Trading Operations:** Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and new distinctive numbers for accurate trade processing and settlement.
