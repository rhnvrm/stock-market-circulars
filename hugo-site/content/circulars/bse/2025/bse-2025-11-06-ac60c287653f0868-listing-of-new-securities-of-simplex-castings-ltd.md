## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with limited market impact. The listing represents approximately 5.76 lakh new shares issued through warrant conversion on a preferential basis. The lock-in periods ranging from 2026 to 2027 indicate these shares cannot be freely traded immediately, minimizing short-term supply impact. The shares rank equally with existing equity shares, maintaining uniformity in shareholder rights. This action is relevant primarily to existing shareholders and investors specifically tracking Simplex Castings Ltd.
