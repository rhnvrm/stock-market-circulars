## Summary

Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd (ICCL) will conduct a mock session on December 20, 2025 to test Two-way SaaS portability using the SaaS instance ICCL@NCL. The SaaS instance will be invoked at approximately 2:00 PM, after which all ICCL clearing members must log in exclusively through the ICCL@NCL instance for RTRMS system, N-MASS, CIM, and NCMS.exe using their pre-provided credentials. This exercise is part of ICCL's business continuity planning for clearing corporations.

- Members must use previously provided login credentials for SaaS instance
- Access through specific URLs: https://rtrmssaas.icclindia.com/CIM/ (CIM) and https://rtrmssaas.icclindia.com/ (N-MASS)
- Applies to N-MASS, CIM, and NCMS.exe systems

## Important Dates

- **December 20, 2025**: Mock session date for testing SaaS portability
- **Approximately 2:00 PM on December 20, 2025**: ICCL@NCL SaaS instance activation time
- **December 18, 2025**: Date of reference BSE circulars (20251218-51, 20251218-52, 20251218-53) containing detailed mock timings

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - All ICCL clearing members will experience a temporary shift from regular RTRMS system to SaaS instance during the mock session. Members must ensure technical readiness and staff availability to participate in testing.

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a mock session for business continuity testing purposes and does not affect actual trading or settlement operations. However, successful testing is critical for disaster recovery preparedness.

**Member Preparedness**: Members need to ensure they have access to pre-provided credentials for ICCL@NCL instance and technical infrastructure to access the SaaS URLs. The exercise tests the portability framework that would be crucial in actual business continuity scenarios.

**System Scope**: Affects multiple systems including RTRMS, N-MASS, CIM, and NCMS.exe, requiring comprehensive testing across all clearing member operational platforms.
