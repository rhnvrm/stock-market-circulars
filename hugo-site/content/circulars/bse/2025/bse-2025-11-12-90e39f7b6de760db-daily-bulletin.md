## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Multiple dividend announcements from prominent companies will result in fund outflows but are routine corporate actions. Asian Paints' high percentage dividend (450%) and CARE Ratings' 80% dividend are notable.

**Investor Impact**: Medium - Investors holding these securities on record dates will receive benefits. Those trading around ex-dates should account for price adjustments.

**Debt Market Impact**: Low to Medium - Regular CP and NCD redemptions maintain normal debt market operations. Multiple redemptions by 360 ONE WAM and Fedbank indicate routine treasury management.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Standard corporate action processing for exchanges, depositories, and registrars.
