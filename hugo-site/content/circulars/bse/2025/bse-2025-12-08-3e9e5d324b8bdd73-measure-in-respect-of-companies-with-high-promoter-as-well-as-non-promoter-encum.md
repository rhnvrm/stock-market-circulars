## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects 7 securities with enhanced surveillance due to high encumbrance levels. The addition of Premier Energy and Infrastructure Ltd indicates heightened concern about pledged holdings.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in these securities should be aware of the elevated risk due to high encumbrance of both promoter and non-promoter shares, which could lead to forced selling in case of margin calls or loan defaults.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under this measure may experience additional scrutiny from market participants and potential liquidity constraints as institutional investors may avoid highly encumbered stocks.

**Risk Indicators**: High encumbrance levels indicate financial stress and potential governance concerns. Investors should monitor these companies closely for any adverse developments.
