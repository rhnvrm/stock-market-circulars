## Impact Assessment

This is a routine commercial paper listing with minimal market impact. The listing provides short-term debt instruments for institutional investors in the debt segment. With high credit ratings (A1+), the instruments represent low credit risk. The Rs. 100 crore issue size is modest and will not significantly affect overall debt market liquidity. Impact is limited to debt market participants interested in highly-rated short-term instruments maturing in approximately 9 months.
