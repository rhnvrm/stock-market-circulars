The record date for this sub-division has been fixed as December 19, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Space Incubatrics Technologies Ltd
- Scrip Code: 541890
- Current Face Value: Rs.10/- per equity share
- New Face Value: Re.1/- per equity share
- Sub-division Ratio: 1:10 (One share of Rs.10/- becomes Ten shares of Re.1/- each)
- Record Date: December 19, 2025
- Segment: Equity - Dematerialised Securities (Rolling Settlement)
- Notice Reference: DR-781/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

- The existing ISIN No. INE797Z01010 (Rs.10/- paid up) will not be valid for transactions on the Exchange on or after December 19, 2025
- A new ISIN Number for Re.1/- paid up shares will be allocated and communicated to the market through a separate notice

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date and ensure proper handling of transactions
- All transactions from December 19, 2025 onwards must use the new ISIN for Re.1/- face value shares
- The old ISIN cannot be used for exchange transactions from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **December 8, 2025**: Circular announcement date
- **December 19, 2025**: Record date for sub-division and effective date for new face value
- **December 19, 2025**: Date from which old ISIN (INE797Z01010) becomes invalid for exchange transactions

## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Shareholders**: Each shareholder will receive 10 shares of Re.1/- face value for every 1 share of Rs.10/- face value held as of the record date. The total investment value remains unchanged.

**Impact on Trading**: The stock will trade at approximately 1/10th of its pre-split price from December 19, 2025. This may improve liquidity and make the stock more accessible to retail investors.

**Impact on Market Systems**: Trading and depository systems need to be updated with the new ISIN. Members must ensure their systems reflect the new face value and adjusted number of shares post-record date.

**Impact on Corporate Actions**: All pending corporate actions, dividends, and rights will be adjusted proportionately to reflect the new face value and increased number of shares.
