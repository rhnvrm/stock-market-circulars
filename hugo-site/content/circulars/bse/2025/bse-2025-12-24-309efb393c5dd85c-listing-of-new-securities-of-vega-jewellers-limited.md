## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification for preferential share issuance. The total issuance of approximately 2 lakh shares represents modest dilution. The 18-month lock-in period (until June 30, 2026) prevents immediate selling pressure. Impact is limited to Vega Jewellers Limited shareholders and has no broader market implications. The preferential issue at Rs. 55 per share indicates capital raising through warrant conversion.
