title: Non Suspension of Trading in Debentures of SHRIRAM FINANCE LTD (Scrip Code
  974379)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a notice confirming that trading in debentures of Shriram Finance Ltd (Scrip Code: 974379) will continue without suspension from November 6, 2025. This follows the company's disclosure that only 114 out of 500 outstanding NCDs will be redeemed through put option exercise, resulting in partial rather than full redemption.

## Key Points

- Shriram Finance received put option exercise notices from holders of 114 NCDs out of total 500 outstanding NCDs
- Partial redemption will occur instead of full redemption
- Company requested BSE not to suspend trading in the debentures
- Trading will continue uninterrupted from November 6, 2025 onwards
- This supersedes earlier notice dated October 30, 2025 (Notice No. 20251030-61)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a procedural update modifying the expected trading suspension communicated in the previous notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are advised to note that Scrip Code 974379 will remain tradable
- No additional compliance requirements for market participants

## Important Dates

- **October 30, 2025**: Original notice issued about record date (Notice No. 20251030-61)
- **November 4, 2025**: Current notice issued confirming non-suspension
- **November 6, 2025**: Record date for interest payment and early redemption; trading continues from this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The continuation of trading provides liquidity to remaining NCD holders and maintains normal market operations for this security.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Trading members can continue regular trading activities without disruption. Only 22.8% of NCDs (114 out of 500) will be redeemed, allowing the majority to remain outstanding and tradable.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for holders not exercising put options, as they retain liquidity through continued trading. Neutral for those exercising redemption rights.
