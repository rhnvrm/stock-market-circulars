## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure their systems are updated with the new price bands before market opening on December 31, 2025
- All trading activity in these scrips must adhere to the revised price band limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 30, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 31, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
The revision affects daily trading volatility limits for 22 securities. Stocks with wider bands (20%) will have greater intraday price movement flexibility, while those with tighter bands (2-5%) will face stricter controls. This particularly impacts recently listed companies like Swiggy and Waaree Energies, which are assigned 10% bands.

**Trading Impact:**
Traders and investors should adjust their strategies based on the new price movement limits. Stocks moved to narrower bands may see reduced speculative activity, while those with wider bands may experience increased volatility and trading opportunities.

**Risk Management:**
Brokers and risk management systems need to update position limits and margin requirements based on the new price bands to ensure compliance with exchange regulations.
