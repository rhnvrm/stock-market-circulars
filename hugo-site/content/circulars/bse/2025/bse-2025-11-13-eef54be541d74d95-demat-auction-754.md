## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects multiple market participants with delivery obligations across 102 scrips.

**Operational Impact:** The auction settlement will impact brokers and clients who failed to deliver securities on time. Participants will need to arrange for securities through the auction mechanism, which typically involves higher costs than normal market transactions.

**Financial Impact:** Participants with shortfalls will incur auction costs and penalties. The wide range of scrips (from large-cap to small-cap) means diverse market participants are affected.

**Liquidity Impact:** Temporary impact on liquidity for the listed scrips during the auction settlement process, particularly for scrips with larger quantities like Money Masters, Mirae Asset, and Murae Organics where significant volumes are involved.
