## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of DBL INFRA ASSETS PRIVATE LIMITED effective November 12, 2025. The suspension follows the company's notification of early redemption of its 13% NCDs maturing on August 28, 2026 (ISIN: INE0IJE08011, Scrip Code: 973405). Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the effective date.

## Key Points

- Instrument: 13% Non-Convertible Debentures

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealings in the specified debentures from November 12, 2025
- Trading members are required to take note of this suspension
- No further transactions should be executed in ISIN INE0IJE08011

## Important Dates

- **Trading Suspension Effective Date**: November 12, 2025
- **Original NCD Maturity**: August 28, 2026 (now superseded by early redemption)

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this circular is minimal and highly localized. It affects only holders and potential traders of a specific private limited company's debt instrument. Early redemption typically benefits debenture holders through timely principal repayment. The suspension prevents inadvertent trading in securities that are being redeemed. No broader market implications are expected as this involves a single private company's debt instrument with limited secondary market activity.
