## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. The extension provides existing shareholders additional time to participate in the rights issue, potentially improving subscription rates. This is a positive development for shareholders who may have missed the original deadline.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. The extension is a procedural matter that shifts the post-issue timeline by 6 days. All other terms and conditions of the rights issue remain unchanged.

**Shareholder Impact**: Medium. Eligible shareholders now have until December 16, 2025 to submit their applications, providing greater flexibility for decision-making and payment arrangements. Those who already subscribed are unaffected by the extension.
