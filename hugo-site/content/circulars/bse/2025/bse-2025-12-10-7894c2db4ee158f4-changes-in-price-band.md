## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 10, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 11, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revised price bands will limit intraday price movements for these 11 securities. Securities with tighter bands (2% and 5%) will experience more trading restrictions, potentially reducing volatility but also limiting liquidity. KSR Footwear with a 20% band has more trading flexibility compared to the others.

**Trading Impact**: Investors and traders in these securities will need to adjust their strategies to account for the price band limitations. Day trading and volatile price movements will be constrained, particularly for Continental Controls and Rotographics India with the tightest 2% bands.

**Investor Impact**: Investors should be aware that these price band revisions typically indicate surveillance concerns related to unusual price movements, volatility, or compliance issues. The varying levels of restriction suggest different degrees of surveillance measures applied to each security.
