Trading in these debentures will commence with reduced face values effective from January 1, 2026 in settlement DR-789/2025-2026.

## Key Points

- Two debenture series affected: EARCL-2%-7-10-28-PVT (ISIN: INE015L07576) and EARC-2%-22-7-29-PVT (ISIN: INE015L07683)
- Record date for part redemption and interest payment: January 1, 2026

- First debenture (958306) reduced face value: Rs. 186,644.43 per debenture
- Second debenture (958889) reduced face value: Rs. 21,174.06 per debenture

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action notification for part redemption of debt securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the reduced face values effective from January 1, 2026
- Trading members should ensure systems reflect the new face values for both debenture series
- All trades executed on or after January 1, 2026 must be at the reduced face values

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: January 1, 2026 - Determination of debenture holders eligible for interest payment and part redemption
- **Effective Date of Reduced Face Value**: January 1, 2026 (Settlement DR-789/2025-2026)
- **Circular Issue Date**: December 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of the two specific debenture series. The part redemption will return capital to debenture holders while reducing the outstanding principal amount.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the reduced face values. The significant reduction in face values (from higher amounts to Rs. 186,644.43 and Rs. 21,174.06 respectively) indicates substantial partial redemption.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders on record as of January 1, 2026 will receive partial redemption proceeds and interest payment. Subsequent trading will be based on the reduced face values, affecting yield calculations and pricing.
