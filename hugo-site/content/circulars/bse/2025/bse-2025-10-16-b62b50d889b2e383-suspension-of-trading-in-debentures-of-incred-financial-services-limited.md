Trading members are advised not to deal in these specified debentures.

## Key Points

- Two NCD series of INCRED FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED affected by trading suspension
- IFSL-9.55%-10-11-25-NCD (ISIN: INE321N07335, Code: 939006)
- IFSL-9.66%-10-11-25-NCD (ISIN: INE321N07350, Code: 939008)
- Trading suspension effective from October 24, 2025
- Record date set for October 26, 2025
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Notice reference: DR-742/2025-2026
- Issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Operations (CRD)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational notice for trading suspension ahead of corporate action completion.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the specified debentures from October 24, 2025
- Members are required to take note of the suspension and ensure compliance
- No transactions should be executed in INE321N07335 (939006) and INE321N07350 (939008) from the no-dealings date

## Important Dates

- **October 16, 2025**: Notice issued
- **October 24, 2025**: Trading suspension begins (no dealings from this date)
- **October 26, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **November 10, 2025**: Implied maturity date based on debenture nomenclature

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders and traders of these specific two NCD series. The suspension is temporary and related to the planned maturity and final interest payment process.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders as of the record date (October 26, 2025) will receive their redemption amount and final interest payment. Trading liquidity is removed for 3 days before the record date to finalize beneficial ownership.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trading in these securities. The suspension ensures clean settlement of the corporate action without complications from ongoing trades.

**Severity Rationale**: High severity for affected investors who may need liquidity in these specific instruments, but the planned nature and advance notice mitigate operational risks.
