## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it represents a routine short-term debt instrument listing. The Commercial Paper provides Aditya Birla Housing Finance Limited with short-term funding at a discount (issue price Rs. 4,92,546 vs face value Rs. 5,00,000), implying an approximate yield for the 91-day tenure. The high credit ratings (CRISIL A1+ and ICRA A1+) indicate strong creditworthiness. The listing adds liquidity options for institutional investors and treasury desks looking for short-term high-rated debt instruments in the secondary market. Impact is limited to debt market participants and does not affect equity markets or broader retail investors.
