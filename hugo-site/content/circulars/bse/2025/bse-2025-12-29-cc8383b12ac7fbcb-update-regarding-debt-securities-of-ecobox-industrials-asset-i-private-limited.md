---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update regarding changes to the security terms of debt securities issued by Ecobox Industrials Asset I Private Limited. The circular outlines revisions to two ISINs (INE12W707021 and INE12W707013), replacing share pledge-based security with a combination of corporate guarantees, mortgages over operational warehousing assets, and charges over present and future assets.

## Key Points

- Two debenture ISINs affected: INE12W707021 and INE12W707013
- Removal of 100% share pledge over KVR Industrial Park Private Limited, Indospace Chittoor Private Limited, and Indospace Chittoor II Private Limited
- Addition of RVK Industrial Park Private Limited as a new guarantor entity
- Introduction of mortgages over operational warehousing assets with leasable area of 2.6 million square feet and 419,028 square metres of land located at Pune and Chittoor
- Corporate guarantees now provided by four entities: KVR Industrial Park Private Limited, RVK Industrial Park Private Limited, Indospace Chittoor Private Limited, and Indospace Chittoor II Private Limited
- Comprehensive charge over all present and future assets of guarantor entities and the issuer
- Subordination of intercompany loans maintained in revised structure

## Regulatory Changes

The security structure for both debenture series has been fundamentally restructured from equity pledge-based security to asset-backed security with corporate guarantees.

**For ISIN INE12W707021:**
- **Removed:** Pledge over 100% shares of three entities
- **Added:** RVK Industrial Park Private Limited as guarantor; Mortgages over operational warehousing assets; Charges over all present and future assets

**For ISIN INE12W707013:**
- **Removed:** Pledge over 100% shares of three entities  
- **Added:** RVK Industrial Park Private Limited as guarantor; Mortgages over operational warehousing assets (2.6 msft leasable area and 419,028 sq metres land)
- **Restructured:** Comprehensive asset charge framework covering KVR Industrial Park, RVK Industrial Park, Indospace Chittoor, and Indospace Chittoor II entities

## Compliance Requirements

Debenture holders should:
- Review the revised security structure and assess impact on their debt holdings
- Note the change from share pledge to operational asset-backed security
- Monitor the newly added RVK Industrial Park Private Limited entity as additional guarantor
- Review transaction documents for specific timelines and manner of security creation

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: December 29, 2025
- Specific timelines for security creation to be detailed in transaction documents

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects specific debenture holders of Ecobox Industrials Asset I Private Limited

**Security Impact:** The revised structure provides:
- Enhanced diversification through additional guarantor (RVK Industrial Park)
- Tangible asset backing through mortgages over 2.6 million sq ft of operational warehousing facilities
- Comprehensive charge over present and future assets providing broader security coverage
- Potential reduction in liquidity risk by replacing share pledges with operational asset mortgages

**Credit Impact:** The substitution of equity pledges with operational asset mortgages and corporate guarantees may alter the risk profile for debenture holders, requiring reassessment of credit quality and recovery prospects.
