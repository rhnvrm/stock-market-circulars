**Market Operations:** The framework helps maintain orderly market conditions by preventing excessive speculation and volatility in vulnerable securities.

**Investor Protection:** Enhanced surveillance protects retail investors from potential manipulation or excessive price swings in these securities.

**Liquidity Considerations:** Some securities may experience reduced trading volumes due to stricter price movement limits, affecting market depth and execution efficiency.
