TOYS INDIA LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544641) will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to the Rolling settlement segment effective December 30, 2025.

## Key Points

- New segment: Rolling settlement (M Group)
- Effective date: Tuesday, December 30, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for K. V. TOYS INDIA LIMITED shares will change from Trade for Trade settlement to Rolling settlement. This represents a graduation from the more restrictive MT Group (typically used for newly listed or high-risk securities) to the regular M Group with rolling settlement.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members should:
- Update their systems to reflect the group change from MT to M Group
- Adjust trading protocols for rolling settlement instead of Trade for Trade
- Contact Mr. Anurag Jain on Tel. No. 022-2272 8822 for clarifications or technical details
- Inform clients about the improved liquidity and settlement arrangements

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: Monday, December 15, 2025
- **Effective Date**: Tuesday, December 30, 2025
- **Reference Notice**: Notice No. 20251212-47 dated Friday, December 12, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The shift from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment generally improves liquidity and reduces settlement time for investors. This is a positive development for shareholders as it allows for more flexible trading with T+2 settlement instead of immediate delivery requirements.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members will need to update their systems and processes to accommodate the group change. The transition is routine for post-IPO SME stocks and indicates the company has completed its initial listing phase successfully.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will benefit from improved liquidity and easier exit options. The move to rolling settlement reduces the capital requirement for trading as investors no longer need to provide full upfront payment and delivery.
