## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The reconstitution will trigger significant passive fund flows as index-tracking funds rebalance their portfolios. Stocks being added will see buying pressure, while deleted stocks may face selling pressure.

**Specific Stock Impact**:
- **Positive**: Interglobe Aviation (SENSEX inclusion), IDFC First Bank (BSE 100 inclusion), Max Healthcare (SENSEX 50 inclusion), Canara Bank, AU Small Finance Bank, Punjab National Bank, and Union Bank (BANKEX inclusions)
- **Negative**: Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (SENSEX exit), Adani Green Energy (BSE 100 and SENSEX Next 50 exits), Indusind Bank (SENSEX 50 exit to SENSEX Next 50)

**Sectoral Impact**: Banking sector representation increases in BANKEX with addition of four public and private sector banks, reflecting the sector's evolving market position.

**Portfolio Implications**: Passive investors with exposure to these indices should expect automatic rebalancing. Active investors may anticipate trading opportunities around the effective dates due to index-related fund flows.
