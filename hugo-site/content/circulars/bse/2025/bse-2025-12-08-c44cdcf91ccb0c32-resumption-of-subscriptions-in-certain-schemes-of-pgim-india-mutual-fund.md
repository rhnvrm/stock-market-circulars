## Summary

PGIM India Asset Management has decided to reopen subscriptions in three designated international fund of fund schemes effective December 08, 2025, following SEBI's permission to accept subscriptions within available overseas investment headroom. The schemes were temporarily suspended on November 17, 2025. Subscriptions will be accepted with a daily limit of INR 2 crore per investor per scheme.

## Key Points

- Three schemes reopening: PGIM India Global Equity Opportunities Fund of Fund, PGIM India Emerging Markets Equity Fund of Fund, and PGIM India Global Select Real Estate Securities Fund of Fund
- Lumpsum investments limited to maximum INR 2,00,00,000 per day, per investor, per scheme (at Primary holder PAN level)
- Subscriptions accepted before cut-off time on any business day
- No fresh SIP or STP registrations allowed
- Existing registered SIPs and STPs will continue
- No switch-ins permitted into these schemes
- Based on SEBI letter dated June 17, 2022 allowing investments within overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI vide letter no. SEBI/HO/OW/IMD-II/DoF3/P/25095/2022 dated June 17, 2022 has permitted Mutual Funds to accept subscriptions and invest in overseas funds/securities up to the headroom available without breaching the overseas investment limits as of EOD of February 1, 2022 at Mutual Fund level.

## Compliance Requirements

- Unit holders are requested to update their PAN, KYC, email address, mobile number, and nominee details with AMC
- Unit holders advised to link their PAN with Aadhaar Number
- Unit holders can view the Investor Charter on the Mutual Fund website
- Unit holders should check for any unclaimed redemptions or IDCW payments
- Investment managers must monitor daily investment limits per investor at PAN level

## Important Dates

- **December 08, 2025**: Effective date for resumption of subscriptions in the designated schemes
- **November 17, 2025**: Date when subscriptions were temporarily suspended (reference date)
- **December 04, 2025**: Notice date

## Impact Assessment

The reopening has minimal market impact as it affects only three specific international fund of fund schemes with restricted subscription limits. The INR 2 crore daily limit per investor constrains large-scale investments. Retail and institutional investors in these schemes can now resume lumpsum investments within prescribed limits. The restriction on fresh SIP/STP registrations limits automated investment flows but protects existing systematic investors. This is primarily an operational update for PGIM India Mutual Fund investors with no broader market implications.
