## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing announcement for a preferential allotment following warrant conversion. The impact is limited as:

- The company is a small-cap stock (Scrip Code: 539770)
- 18 lakh shares represent a relatively small issuance
- Shares are locked-in for over 6 months, preventing immediate selling pressure
- The shares rank pari-passu with existing equity, maintaining uniformity in shareholder rights
- No immediate market impact expected as the allotment occurred in October 2025 and shares are now being formally listed for trading
