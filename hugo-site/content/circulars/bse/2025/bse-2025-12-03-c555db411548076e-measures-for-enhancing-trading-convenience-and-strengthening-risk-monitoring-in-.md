title: Measures for Enhancing Trading Convenience and Strengthening Risk Monitoring
  in Equity Derivatives

## Summary

BSE has implemented new risk management measures for the pre-open session in equity derivatives (both single stocks and indices) following SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2025/79 dated May 29, 2025. The framework introduces stringent margin checks at order level before inclusion in pre-open session, with no netting benefits and calendar spread or cross margining advantages.

## Key Points

- All orders must pass margin sufficiency checks at order level before pre-open session inclusion
- Incoming orders subjected to pre-risk management for SPAN + ELM margins
- Risk parameters and maximum execution price considered during pre-open session
- Order level margins assessed along with client's brought forward portfolio at clearing member level
- No netting of pre-open orders with brought forward portfolio or offsetting orders
- For offsetting pre-open orders, higher of SPAN+ELM (long or short side) considered
- Margin benefits from calendar spread and cross margining not applicable during pre-open session

## Regulatory Changes

**Pre-Open Session Risk Framework:**
- Mandatory margin sufficiency verification before order acceptance
- Contract-level pre-risk management implementation
- Elimination of netting benefits during pre-open session
- Removal of calendar spread and cross margining advantages for pre-open orders

**Order Validation Process:**
- Risk parameters prevailing at pre-open session time to be used
- Maximum potential execution price to be factored in margin calculations
- Aggregated assessment at clearing member level for margin sufficiency

## Compliance Requirements

**For All Members:**
- Ensure all pre-open session orders meet margin sufficiency requirements
- Implement order-level margin checks before submission
- Account for SPAN + ELM margins at contract level
- Verify clearing member-level margin adequacy including client portfolios

**For Clearing Members:**
- Assess overall margin sufficiency considering client brought forward portfolios
- Manage higher margin requirements due to no netting benefits
- Monitor offsetting orders and apply higher of long/short side SPAN+ELM

## Important Dates

- **SEBI Circular Date:** May 29, 2025
- **ICCL Circular Date:** May 30, 2025
- **Notice Date:** December 03, 2025
- **Effective Date:** Immediate (as per notice issuance)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Higher margin requirements during pre-open session may reduce order flow
- Increased capital deployment needed for pre-open trading activity
- Enhanced risk monitoring strengthens market integrity

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members need to adjust systems for stricter margin checks
- Clients may face order rejections if insufficient margins
- Risk management systems require updates to handle new framework

**Participant Impact:**
- Traders must maintain higher margins for pre-open session participation
- Loss of netting benefits increases capital costs
- Removal of cross margining and calendar spread benefits reduces margin efficiency
