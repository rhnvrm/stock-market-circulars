## Impact Assessment

This circular impacts securities lending and borrowing market participants who have positions in the affected securities. The temporary shut periods will restrict SLB transactions, requiring participants to plan their lending/borrowing strategies accordingly. The staggered dates across multiple companies may affect overall SLB market liquidity during the November 14-28, 2025 period. Market participants should adjust their positions before the respective shut periods to avoid disruptions.
