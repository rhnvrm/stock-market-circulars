## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine corporate action that typically has minimal impact on stock prices. The number of shares being listed represents a small percentage of the total outstanding shares for most companies.

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal increase in floating stock for the affected companies. Urban Company has the largest issuance with 10.2 million shares, while IndiGo has the smallest with only 1,200 shares.

**Investor Impact:** No direct impact on existing shareholders. These shares were already accounted for in the diluted equity calculations disclosed in company financials.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and new ISIN distribution ranges for accurate position tracking and settlement.
