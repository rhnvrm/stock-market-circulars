## Impact Assessment

The preferential allotment represents a significant capital raise for Tega Industries Limited at a substantial premium. With an issue price of Rs. 1,994 per share, the total capital raised amounts to approximately Rs. 171.36 crores. The lock-in provisions ensure that a majority of shares (78.19 lakh out of 85.92 lakh) will be locked for 18 months, while a smaller portion (7.72 lakh shares) will remain locked for 30 months. This staggered unlock mechanism provides stability and prevents immediate dilution pressure. Market participants should note the increased float post lock-in expiry dates.
