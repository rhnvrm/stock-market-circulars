## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to debt market participants dealing in commercial papers. The simultaneous redemption of 15 commercial papers on December 11, 2025 indicates typical quarter-end/year-end liquidity management by issuers.

**Liquidity Impact**: Investors holding these commercial papers will receive redemption proceeds on respective maturity dates, potentially redeploying funds into new instruments.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure compliance systems are updated to prevent inadvertent trades in suspended securities. Failures could result in trade cancellations or regulatory action.

**Issuer Profile**: Diverse mix including major financial institutions (SBI Cards, Axis Finance), NBFCs (IndoStar, Aditya Birla Housing Finance), wealth managers (360 ONE WAM), and large corporates (Grasim, Shree Cements, Tata Realty), indicating healthy commercial paper market activity across sectors.
