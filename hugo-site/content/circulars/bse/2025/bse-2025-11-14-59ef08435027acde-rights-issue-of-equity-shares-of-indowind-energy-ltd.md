## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will have the opportunity to subscribe to additional shares proportionate to their holdings at a discounted price. Shareholders must hold shares before the ex-rights date to be eligible.

**Trading Impact**: From November 19, 2025, the stock will trade ex-rights, meaning new buyers after this date will not be entitled to participate in the rights issue. This typically results in stock price adjustment to reflect the rights value.

**Capital Structure**: The rights issue will result in equity dilution and increase in share capital, subject to shareholder subscription levels. The issue provides existing shareholders the opportunity to maintain their proportionate ownership.
