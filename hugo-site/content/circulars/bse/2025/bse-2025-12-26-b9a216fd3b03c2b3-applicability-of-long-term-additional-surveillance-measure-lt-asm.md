2. Garnet International Ltd (Scrip Code: 512493, ISIN: INE590B01010)
3. Teamo Productions HQ Ltd (Scrip Code: 533048, ISIN: INE065J01024)

**Annexure II - Securities Exiting LT-ASM:**
26 securities including Aayush Wellness Ltd, ACS Technologies Ltd, Flexituff Ventures International Ltd, and others will exit the surveillance framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised surveillance status of affected securities
- Trading in newly added LT-ASM securities will be subject to enhanced surveillance measures including potential price bands, trade-for-trade settlement, and additional margin requirements
- Securities exiting LT-ASM will return to normal trading conditions without additional surveillance restrictions
- Broker-dealers should update their systems to reflect new ASM classifications
- Investors holding securities in higher ASM stages should be aware of stricter trading conditions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 29, 2025 - All changes to LT-ASM framework become applicable
- **Circular Issue Date:** December 26, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
Securities entering LT-ASM or moving to higher stages will face enhanced surveillance including potential liquidity constraints, wider bid-ask spreads, and reduced trading volumes due to stricter requirements. The 26 securities exiting the framework will benefit from improved liquidity and normal trading conditions.

**Investor Impact:**
Investors holding securities in Part A and Part B face increased trading restrictions and higher margin requirements. Those holding securities in Annexure II will see improved market access. Securities moving to lower ASM stages (Part C) will experience gradual easing of restrictions.

**Operational Impact:**
Brokers and trading members must update surveillance classifications, adjust margin requirements, and communicate changes to clients holding affected securities. Risk management systems need recalibration for the 35 securities with changed surveillance status.
