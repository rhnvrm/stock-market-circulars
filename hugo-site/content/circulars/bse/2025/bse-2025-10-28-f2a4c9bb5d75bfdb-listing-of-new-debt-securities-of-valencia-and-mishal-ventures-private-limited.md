## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt security listing with minimal market-wide impact. The securities are issued on private placement basis by a private limited company, targeting institutional or high-net-worth investors given the high face value of Rs. 1 lakh per unit. The BB- credit rating indicates below investment grade status with stable outlook. The 12% coupon rate reflects the risk profile of the issuer. Impact is limited to debt market participants and specific investors interested in higher-yielding, sub-investment grade corporate debt.
