## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market-wide impact as it affects only specific debt instruments nearing maturity. The trading suspension is a routine administrative measure to facilitate orderly redemption of commercial paper. Investors holding these instruments will receive redemption proceeds on the scheduled dates. No impact on equity markets or other debt segments. The measure ensures clean settlement and prevents trading after the record date for redemption purposes.
