## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - This part redemption represents approximately 50% of the face value, returning capital to debenture holders while reducing the outstanding debt obligation. Liquidity in these debentures may be affected as the face value is halved.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will receive partial redemption of approximately Rs. 50,000.01 per debenture along with accrued interest. The remaining investment will continue with reduced face value until final maturity in June 2027.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face value for accurate pricing and settlement of trades executed on or after December 10, 2025.
