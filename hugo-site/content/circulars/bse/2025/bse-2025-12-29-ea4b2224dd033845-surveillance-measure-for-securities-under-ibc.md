title: Surveillance Measure for Securities under IBC - December 30, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has updated its Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Effective December 30, 2025, Indosolar Ltd (Scrip Code: 533257, ISIN: INE866K01023) has been moved to Stage 1 surveillance due to entering the Insolvency Resolution Process. No securities are moving between other stages or being excluded from surveillance. The circular includes a consolidated list of 15+ securities currently under various stages of IBC surveillance.

## Key Points

- Indosolar Ltd (533257) enters Stage 1 Additional Surveillance Measure for IRP under IBC
- No securities added to Stage 0 (receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure)
- No securities moving from Stage I to Stage II or vice versa
- No securities excluded from ASM framework
- Changes effective December 30, 2025
- Consolidated list includes securities at various IBC stages including Aban Offshore, Ansal Properties, Arshiya Limited, and others

## Regulatory Changes

The IBC surveillance framework operates in stages:
- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from company regarding insolvency proceedings
- **Stage 1**: Securities enter Additional Surveillance Measure upon formal IRP initiation
- **Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance for prolonged insolvency cases

Securities under IBC surveillance face special trading conditions and increased monitoring to protect investor interests during insolvency resolution.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the surveillance status of Indosolar Ltd effective December 30, 2025
- Trading members should inform clients about IBC surveillance implications
- Investors should be aware of heightened risk associated with securities under IBC proceedings
- Companies under surveillance must continue disclosure obligations regarding insolvency process updates

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 30, 2025 - Indosolar Ltd moves to IBC Stage 1 surveillance

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - IBC surveillance status significantly affects investor sentiment and trading behavior for affected securities. Stage 1 classification indicates formal insolvency proceedings have commenced.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under IBC surveillance typically experience reduced liquidity, wider bid-ask spreads, and special margin requirements. Investors face elevated resolution uncertainty.

**Investor Risk**: Very High for Indosolar Ltd - IRP initiation signals financial distress and uncertain recovery prospects. Shareholders may face significant dilution or complete loss depending on resolution outcome.

**Operational Impact**: The consolidated list shows 15+ securities across various IBC stages, indicating ongoing exchange monitoring of financially stressed companies to maintain market integrity.
