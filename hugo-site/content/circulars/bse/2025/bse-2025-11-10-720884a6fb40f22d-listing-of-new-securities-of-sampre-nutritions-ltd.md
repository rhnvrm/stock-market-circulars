## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with limited market impact. The preferential allotment increases the equity base of Sampre Nutritions Ltd. by 8,40,000 shares. The lock-in periods ranging from approximately 9 months to 2 years and 9 months ensure that most shares cannot be immediately traded, limiting short-term supply impact. The allotment to both promoters and non-promoters may affect shareholding patterns as per disclosure requirements.
