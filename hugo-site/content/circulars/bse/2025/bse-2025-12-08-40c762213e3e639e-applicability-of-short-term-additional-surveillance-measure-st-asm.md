## Regulatory Framework

The Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) is a surveillance framework implemented by BSE to monitor securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or unusual trading patterns over short periods (5/15/30 days). Securities under ST-ASM are subject to enhanced surveillance and may have additional trading restrictions.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 09, 2025
- **Circular Date:** December 08, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Securities added to ST-ASM may experience reduced liquidity and increased trading costs
- Investors trading in these securities should be aware of additional surveillance measures
- Securities moving out of ST-ASM may see improved trading conditions unless moving to stricter frameworks

**Trading Impact:**
- Stage I and Stage II classifications indicate different levels of surveillance intensity
- Multiple SME scrips affected, impacting small and medium enterprise trading segment
- Securities moving to LT-ASM or ESM frameworks will be subject to different surveillance parameters

**Investor Considerations:**
- Enhanced due diligence recommended for securities under ST-ASM
- Potential for higher volatility and price discovery challenges
- Stage II securities indicate continued surveillance concerns
