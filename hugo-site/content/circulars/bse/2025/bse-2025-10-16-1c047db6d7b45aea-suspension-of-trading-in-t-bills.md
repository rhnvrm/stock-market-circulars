## Summary

BSE has issued a notice suspending trading in four T-bills effective October 17, 2025, as they are set to mature on their respective redemption dates. The suspension includes one Sovereign Gold Bond and three Treasury Bills with varying tenures (364-day, 182-day, and 91-day).

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard operational notice for maturing debt instruments.

- Members should update their systems to reflect the trading suspension
- No new positions should be initiated in these instruments

## Important Dates

Investors holding these instruments will receive redemption proceeds on maturity. No broader market implications are expected as this is part of standard debt instrument lifecycle management.
