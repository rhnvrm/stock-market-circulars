## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of preferentially allotted shares following warrant conversion. The shares represent dilution for existing shareholders but the lock-in period until June 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. The listing process is standard and does not affect trading operations for existing shares. The new shares will trade alongside existing equity shares with the same rights and privileges.

**Investor Impact**: Non-promoter investors who converted their warrants now have tradable securities (subject to lock-in). Existing shareholders experience dilution from the 63.56 lakh additional shares in circulation.
