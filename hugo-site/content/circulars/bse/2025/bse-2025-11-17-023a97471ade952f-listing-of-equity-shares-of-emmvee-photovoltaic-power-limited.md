## Impact Assessment

This represents a new listing in the renewable energy/photovoltaic sector on BSE. The strong promoter holding of 80.03% indicates significant promoter confidence and control, while the 19.97% public float meets minimum public shareholding requirements. The high dematerialization rate of 89.38% is positive for trading liquidity. However, the significant pledge of 46.83% of public shareholding may warrant monitoring. The company enters the market with a broad public shareholder base of over 168,000 investors, indicating good retail participation in the issue.
