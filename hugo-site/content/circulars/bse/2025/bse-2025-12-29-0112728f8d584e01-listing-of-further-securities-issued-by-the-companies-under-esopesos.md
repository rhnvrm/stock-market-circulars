## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine corporate action that typically has limited immediate market impact as these shares are issued to employees and often subject to vesting schedules.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in floating stock for the affected companies. The share quantities are relatively small compared to total outstanding shares for most large-cap companies like ITC and AXIS Bank.

**Dilution Effect**: Minor dilution to existing shareholders, with the largest absolute number being UNICOMMERCE (1,017,088 shares), though the percentage dilution would depend on each company's existing share capital.

**Investor Considerations**: Investors should note the lock-in period for Bliss GVS Pharma shares. Other shares will be immediately available for trading, potentially adding to selling pressure if employees choose to liquidate their holdings.
