## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt security listing with limited market-wide impact. The AAA rating indicates strong credit quality for the InvIT's obligations. The staggered maturity structure (5, 10, and 15 years) provides investors with options across different tenures. The 5-15 basis points premium for longer tenures reflects standard yield curve expectations. Trading members in the debt segment can access these securities for institutional and qualified investors interested in infrastructure investment trust debt instruments.
