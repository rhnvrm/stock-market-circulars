## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative listing of government-backed Treasury Bills with minimal market impact. The listing expands the debt instruments available for trading on BSE but does not affect equity markets or require any operational changes from market participants beyond awareness of the new securities. The T-2 trading suspension before maturity is standard practice for debt instruments.
