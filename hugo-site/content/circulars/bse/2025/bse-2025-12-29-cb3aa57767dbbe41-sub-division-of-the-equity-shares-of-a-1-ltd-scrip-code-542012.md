## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The stock sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares tenfold while reducing the face value proportionally, making shares more affordable for retail investors. This typically improves liquidity and trading activity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN and share structure. The change affects all dematerialised holdings in the rolling settlement segment. Shareholders will see their holdings multiplied by ten with a corresponding reduction in per-share price.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive ten shares for every one share held as of the record date. The total investment value remains unchanged, but increased number of shares may improve trading flexibility.
