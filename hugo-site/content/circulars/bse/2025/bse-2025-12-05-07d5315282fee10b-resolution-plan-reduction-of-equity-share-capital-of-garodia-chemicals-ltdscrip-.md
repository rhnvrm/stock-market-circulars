## Impact Assessment

**High Severity and High Impact Event**

This resolution plan represents a severe corporate restructuring with significant implications:

**For Promoters**: Complete loss of 51.79% equity stake (37,28,800 shares) without any compensation, indicating financial distress or insolvency resolution.

**For Public Shareholders**: Massive dilution through 13:1 reverse stock split, reducing holdings by approximately 92.3%. Combined with face value reduction from Rs. 10 to Re. 1, this suggests substantial capital write-down.

**Market Impact**: Trading suspension indicates the stock will be halted from secondary market trading, preventing liquidity and price discovery. The NCLT-approved restructuring suggests the company was likely undergoing insolvency or debt resolution proceedings.

**Regulatory Significance**: This is a court-mandated capital restructuring under insolvency law, representing one of the most severe corporate actions possible, fundamentally altering the ownership structure and capital base of the company.
