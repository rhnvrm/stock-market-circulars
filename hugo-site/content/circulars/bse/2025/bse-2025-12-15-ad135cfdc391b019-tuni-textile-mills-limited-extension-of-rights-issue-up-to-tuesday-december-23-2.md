## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact:** Positive for existing shareholders as the 8-day extension provides additional time to evaluate and exercise their rights, potentially increasing participation rates in the Rights Issue.

**Market Impact:** Minimal market disruption as this is a timeline extension rather than a material change to issue terms. The extension may indicate lower-than-expected initial subscription or company's desire to maximize shareholder participation.

**Operational Impact:** Post-issue activities including allotment, credit of shares, and listing have been correspondingly adjusted but remain on track for completion before year-end 2025.
