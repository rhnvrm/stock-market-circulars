---

## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective December 8, 2025. The circular details securities being newly added to ESM, those moving between ESM stages, and securities exiting the framework. One security (Bharatrohan Airborne Innovations Ltd) is being newly shortlisted for ESM, 21 securities are moving to lower ESM stages, and 25 securities are exiting the ESM framework entirely. No securities are moving to higher ESM stages.

## Key Points

- 1 security newly added to ESM: Bharatrohan Airborne Innovations Ltd (Scrip Code: 544535)
- 21 securities moving to lower (less restrictive) ESM stages
- 25 securities completely exiting ESM framework
- No securities moving to higher (more restrictive) ESM stages
- Changes effective from December 8, 2025
- ESM framework is a risk management tool to protect investor interests

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework continues to operate as a tiered surveillance mechanism. Securities under ESM face additional monitoring and trading restrictions based on their stage. Movement to lower stages indicates improved compliance or reduced risk factors, while exit from ESM indicates normalization of trading patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants trading in affected securities must be aware of ESM stage applicability
- Securities in ESM may have specific margin requirements and price bands
- Investors should review trading conditions for ESM securities before transacting
- Brokers must ensure clients are informed about ESM status of securities

## Important Dates

- **December 8, 2025**: Effective date for all ESM framework changes announced in this circular

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact:**
- 25 securities exiting ESM will experience improved liquidity and reduced trading restrictions
- 21 securities moving to lower ESM stages will face relaxed surveillance measures
- Overall positive sentiment for 46 out of 47 affected securities

**Negative Impact:**
- Bharatrohan Airborne Innovations Ltd entering ESM will face trading restrictions and increased margin requirements
- Investors holding the newly ESM-listed security may experience reduced liquidity

**Market Implications:**
- Enhanced investor confidence in securities exiting or moving down ESM stages
- Improved price discovery and trading volumes expected for securities with reduced restrictions
- Single new ESM addition indicates targeted surveillance approach
