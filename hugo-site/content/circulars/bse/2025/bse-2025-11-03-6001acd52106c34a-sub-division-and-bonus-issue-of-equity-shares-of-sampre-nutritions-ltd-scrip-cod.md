**Operational Impact**: The split/sub-division and bonus issue will increase the total number of outstanding equity shares by 43,693,710 shares, potentially improving liquidity and making the stock more accessible to retail investors. The revised timeline requires coordination between the company, depositories (NSDL/CDSL), and the stock exchange.

**Trading Impact**: Trading in the bonus shares will commence from 13 November 2025, with the stock likely trading ex-bonus before the record date. The increase in share count will proportionately reduce the per-share price while maintaining overall market capitalization.
