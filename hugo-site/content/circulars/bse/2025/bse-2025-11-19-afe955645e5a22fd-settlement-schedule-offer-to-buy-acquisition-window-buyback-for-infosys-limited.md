## Impact Assessment

**Impact Level: Medium**

This circular affects members and custodians participating in the Infosys buyback. The use of early pay-in mechanism requires advance planning to ensure securities are delivered before bidding windows close. The earmarking/blocking of securities in client accounts will temporarily restrict trading of those shares. Members must coordinate with custodians to ensure timely settlement. The automated earmarking process (no EPN file upload needed) simplifies operations but requires proper system integration. Contact ICCL Help Desk (022-69158590/45720490/45720690 or iccl.helpdesk@icclindia.com) for clarifications.
