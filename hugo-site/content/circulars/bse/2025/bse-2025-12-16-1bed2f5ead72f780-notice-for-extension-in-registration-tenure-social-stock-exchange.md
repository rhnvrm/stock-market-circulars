title: Extension in Registration Tenure for NPOs on Social Stock Exchange
---

## Summary

BSE has implemented regulatory changes following SEBI's September 8, 2025 amendments to LODR 2015 and ICDR 2018 regulations. Not for Profit Organisations (NPOs) registered with BSE's Social Stock Exchange platform can now remain registered without raising funds for a maximum period of two years from registration date. Registration will automatically lapse if no funds are raised within this validity period.

## Key Points

- New NPO registrations from September 9, 2025 onwards valid for 2 years
- Existing valid registrations as of September 9, 2025 extended to 2 years from original registration date
- Registration automatically lapses if NPO does not raise funds within two-year validity period
- Changes align with SEBI amendments to LODR 2015 and ICDR 2018 regulations
- Contact sse@bseindia.com for queries

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI amended the following regulations on September 8, 2025:
- SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015
- SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018

Key amendment: NPOs registered with Social Stock Exchange permitted to remain registered without raising funds for maximum two years from registration date.

## Compliance Requirements

- NPOs must raise funds within two-year validity period to maintain registration
- Failure to raise funds within validity period results in automatic registration lapse
- All stakeholders advised to take note of these changes

## Important Dates

- **September 8, 2025**: SEBI notification date for regulatory amendments
- **September 9, 2025**: Effective date for new registration tenure rules
- **Two years from registration**: Maximum validity period for NPO registration without fundraising

## Impact Assessment

This circular provides clarity and formal structure to NPO registrations on the Social Stock Exchange platform. NPOs now have a defined two-year window to raise funds, after which registration automatically lapses. Existing NPOs registered before September 9, 2025 receive the benefit of extended tenure calculated from their original registration dates. The automatic lapse provision ensures active participation and prevents indefinite dormant registrations on the SSE platform.
