## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework continues to be applied to securities showing unusual price movements or volatility patterns. Securities can be moved between different surveillance frameworks based on their risk profile:

- ST-ASM: Short-term surveillance (5/15/30 days)
- LT-ASM: Long-term Additional Surveillance Measure
- ESM: Enhanced Surveillance Measure
- GSM: Graded Surveillance Measure
- Trade for Trade Framework
- Pledge Framework

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of securities under ST-ASM framework
- Trading in ST-ASM securities may be subject to additional restrictions
- Brokers and traders should review their positions in affected securities
- Enhanced margin requirements may apply to securities under surveillance
- Market participants should monitor for any subsequent stage changes

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: November 7, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 11 securities to the ST-ASM framework indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny on these stocks due to unusual price movements or volatility. This will likely result in:

- Increased trading restrictions and margin requirements for affected securities
- Enhanced monitoring by the exchange
- Potential reduction in liquidity for these securities
- Investors should exercise caution when trading these stocks
- Three SME scrips are included in the new additions, reflecting volatility in the SME segment
- Securities moving out to other frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM) will continue under different surveillance mechanisms
- Overall market impact is limited as this affects specific securities only
