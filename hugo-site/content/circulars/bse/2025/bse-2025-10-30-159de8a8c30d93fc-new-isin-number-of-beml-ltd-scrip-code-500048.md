## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The share sub-division will double the number of shares while halving the face value, making shares more affordable for retail investors and potentially improving liquidity. The ISIN change is administrative and should not disrupt trading as the ex-date is clearly communicated.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and investors must ensure their systems and records are updated with the new ISIN. Existing shareholders will automatically receive the sub-divided shares in their demat accounts. The change may temporarily affect order management systems that need to map the old and new ISINs correctly.
