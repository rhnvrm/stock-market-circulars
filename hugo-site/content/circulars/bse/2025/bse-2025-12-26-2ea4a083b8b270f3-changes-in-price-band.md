---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 33 securities effective December 29, 2025. The new price bands range from 2% to 20%, representing tighter trading restrictions compared to the standard price bands. This surveillance measure limits the maximum price movement allowed during trading sessions for the affected scrips.

## Key Points

- 33 securities subject to revised price bands
- Price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 20%
- Effective date: December 29, 2025
- Notice number: 20251226-36

## Regulatory Changes

The exchange has implemented tighter price band restrictions as a surveillance measure. Price bands limit the percentage change in stock price from the previous closing price during a trading session. Stricter bands (lower percentages) indicate heightened regulatory scrutiny and restrict volatility.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 26, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 29, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The revised price bands will restrict intraday price volatility for 33 securities, potentially reducing trading opportunities and liquidity in these scrips. The tighter bands suggest these securities are under enhanced surveillance, likely due to unusual price movements or volatility concerns.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in these securities will face limited price discovery within restricted bands. Buy/sell orders beyond the band limits will not execute, requiring price adjustments.

**Trading Impact**: Day traders and algorithmic strategies targeting these securities will need to adjust for reduced volatility ranges. The most restrictive 2% band significantly limits price movement potential.
