## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular implements existing BSE framework for Rights Entitlements trading as per previous notices 20200305-21 (March 05, 2020) and 20200518-34 (May 18, 2020).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must inform all clients about commencement of RE trading, including the ISIN number
- Trading Members must clarify that REs should not be mistaken for ordinary shares
- Contract notes/bills for RE purchases must include a prominent disclaimer explaining:
  - Purchase of REs only provides right to participate in the Rights Issue by making application with requisite money, or to renounce the REs before issue closes
  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced on or before Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished
- Trading Members must refer to notice 20200305-21 (March 05, 2020) and notice 20200518-34 (May 18, 2020) for additional details

## Important Dates

- **October 30, 2025**: Notice date
- **November 03, 2025**: Rights Entitlements trading begins; Rights Issue opens
- **November 04, 2025**: Rights Entitlements trading ends
- **November 10, 2025**: Rights Issue closes
- **After November 10, 2025**: Unsubscribed and unrenounced REs will lapse and be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to COVIDH TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED shareholders and prospective investors. The 2-day trading window for renunciation is extremely short, requiring swift decision-making by holders.

**Operational Impact**: Trading Members must ensure proper client communication and disclaimer inclusion in contract notes. The trade-for-trade settlement and dematerialized-only requirement necessitates appropriate back-office processing.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders must decide quickly whether to subscribe, renounce, or let REs lapse. The short trading period (2 days) vs. longer issue period (8 days) provides limited time for renunciation in the secondary market.
