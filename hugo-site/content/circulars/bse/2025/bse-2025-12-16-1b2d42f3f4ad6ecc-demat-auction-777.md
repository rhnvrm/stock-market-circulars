## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The auction affects 106 securities across various market capitalizations, from small-cap to large-cap stocks. While individual quantities are generally small (most under 1,000 shares), the breadth of affected securities is significant.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers with delivery shortfalls in these securities must arrange for auction participation or face financial penalties. The presence of high-value stocks like Reliance Industries, ITC, and Tata Consultancy Services may result in higher auction costs.

**Investor Impact**: Investors who have sold these securities and are awaiting delivery may experience settlement delays. The auction mechanism ensures eventual delivery but may occur at prices different from the original transaction price, with the difference borne by the defaulting member.
