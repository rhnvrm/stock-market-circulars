title: Add-on Price Band Framework - Updated List of Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an updated list of securities subject to the Add-on Price Band Framework. The circular contains 31 securities across various sectors that are currently under this surveillance measure, which restricts price movements within specified bands during trading sessions.

## Key Points

- 31 securities are currently subject to add-on price band framework
- List includes companies from diverse sectors including infrastructure, hospitality, textiles, and trading
- Framework applies additional price movement restrictions beyond normal circuit limits
- Updated list replaces previous versions for current applicability

## Regulatory Changes

This represents an update to the existing Add-on Price Band Framework rather than introduction of new regulations. The framework continues to operate under established BSE surveillance mechanisms.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with price band restrictions for listed securities
- Market participants should be aware of additional limitations on price discovery for these scrips
- Brokers must inform clients about applicable trading restrictions

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: August 1, 2025
- Effective immediately for all listed securities

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on affected securities as the add-on price band framework limits volatility and may affect liquidity. Investors in these 31 securities will experience restricted price movements, which could impact trading strategies and position management. The measure is designed to maintain orderly trading and prevent excessive speculation in these particular scrips.
