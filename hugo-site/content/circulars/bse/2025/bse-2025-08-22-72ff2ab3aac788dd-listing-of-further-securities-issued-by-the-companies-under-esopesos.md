## Summary

BSE has processed the listing of further equity shares issued by companies under Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). The circular provides details of 20 separate allotments with varying share quantities and lock-in periods.

## Key Points

- 20 separate allotments of ESOP/ESOS shares listed
- Share allotments range from 112 to 750 shares per allotment
- Distribution numbers assigned from 51801881 to 51807460
- Mixed lock-in periods - some shares have lock-in restrictions while others don't
- Total shares across all allotments: approximately 3,500+ shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine administrative process for listing employee stock option conversions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must ensure proper documentation for ESOP/ESOS conversions
- Adherence to lock-in period requirements where applicable
- Proper maintenance of allotment records and distribution numbers

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: August 22, 2025
- Lock-in status varies by allotment (Yes/No as specified)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as these are routine administrative listings of employee stock options. The relatively small quantities and mixed lock-in periods suggest standard ESOP/ESOS conversions without significant trading implications.
