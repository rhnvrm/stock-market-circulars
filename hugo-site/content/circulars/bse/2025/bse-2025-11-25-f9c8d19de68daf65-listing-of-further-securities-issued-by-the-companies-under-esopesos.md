## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities available for trading
- Standard trading rules and regulations apply to these newly listed shares
- No special compliance requirements beyond normal equity trading protocols

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 25, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date**: November 26, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (NA) - no lock-in period for any of the listed securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The issuance represents routine ESOP/ESOS conversions typical for listed companies as part of employee compensation programs.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in floating stock for most companies given the relatively small number of shares being added compared to existing market capitalization.

**Dilution Impact**: Minor dilution for existing shareholders. For example:
- Yes Bank: 553,703 shares added to existing base of 31+ billion shares (~0.002% dilution)
- ICICI Bank: 24,743 shares added to existing base of 7+ billion shares (negligible)

**Investor Consideration**: These shares are immediately tradable without lock-in restrictions, allowing employees to liquidate positions if desired. However, the volume is unlikely to cause significant price pressure for large-cap stocks.
