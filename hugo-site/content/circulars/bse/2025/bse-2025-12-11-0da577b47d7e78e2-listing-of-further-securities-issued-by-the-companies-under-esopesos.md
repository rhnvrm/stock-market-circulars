**Dilution Impact**: Negligible dilution for existing shareholders given the small quantum of shares relative to total issued capital.

**Trading Impact**: No expected impact on trading as these are small incremental additions to existing listed equity. No lock-in restrictions means shares can be freely traded immediately.

**Corporate Impact**: Reflects execution of employee incentive programs across diverse sectors including fashion, technology, finance, insurance, chemicals, and asset management.
