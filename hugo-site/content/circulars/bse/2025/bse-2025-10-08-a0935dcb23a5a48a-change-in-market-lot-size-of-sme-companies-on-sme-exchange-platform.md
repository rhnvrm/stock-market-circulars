## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** October 8, 2025
- **Effective Date:** November 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects trading in 31 SME securities with lot size reductions ranging from 50-75% (most at 50%). Smaller lot sizes generally improve liquidity and accessibility for retail investors.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to update systems and processes to accommodate new lot sizes. One month transition period provided for implementation.

**Investor Impact:** Positive for retail investors as lower lot sizes reduce minimum investment amounts, making these securities more accessible. For example, NAVIGANT's lot size reduces from 2,500 to 1,250 shares, and YASHHV reduces from 1,000 to 250 shares.
