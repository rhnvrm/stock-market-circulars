## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of over 10 million new equity shares represents a significant addition to the company's equity base. At the issue price of Rs. 21.20 per share, this FCCB conversion resulted in approximately Rs. 213 crore worth of equity issuance.

**Dilution Effect**: Shareholders should note the dilutive impact of these additional shares on their existing holdings. The magnitude of dilution depends on the pre-conversion equity base.

**Liquidity Impact**: The addition of 1 crore+ shares to the float may improve liquidity in the stock, though the actual trading impact will depend on how these shares are distributed among investors.

**Investor Consideration**: As these shares rank pari-passu with existing shares, they carry identical voting rights, dividend entitlements, and other shareholder benefits. The conversion from FCCBs to equity eliminates the debt obligation for the company and strengthens the equity base.
