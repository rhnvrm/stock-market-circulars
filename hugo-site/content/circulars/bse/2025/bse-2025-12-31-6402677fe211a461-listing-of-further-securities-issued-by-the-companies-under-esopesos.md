## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative listing notification with minimal market impact. The issuance of ESOP/ESOS shares represents employee compensation and equity dilution in the respective companies. The number of shares issued is relatively small compared to typical equity capital, and no lock-in restrictions apply. Market participants should update their records for the increased share capital of these companies.
