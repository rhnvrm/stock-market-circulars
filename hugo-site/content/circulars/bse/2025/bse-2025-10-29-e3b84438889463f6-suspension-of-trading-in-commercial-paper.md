**Liquidity Impact**: Temporary reduction in liquidity for these specific commercial papers until redemption is completed. Investors holding these instruments will receive redemption proceeds as per terms.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trades in these ISINs from the specified dates. Standard redemption process with minimal operational disruption expected.
