## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market impact as it involves a relatively small number of shares (334,581) issued on preferential basis to non-promoters. The shares are subject to a lock-in period until May 15, 2026, preventing immediate selling pressure. The issue represents conversion of previously allotted warrants, indicating existing investors exercising their rights. The dilution effect on existing shareholders is limited given the small issue size relative to typical traded volumes.
