title: Change in Minimum Application Amount of Aditya Birla Sun Life Overnight Fund
  on BSE StAR MF platform
---

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited has revised the minimum application amount for the Growth Option of Aditya Birla Sun Life Overnight Fund. The minimum investment requirement has been reduced from Rs. 500 to Rs. 100, with multiples of Re. 1 thereafter. This change is effective from December 4, 2025, and has been implemented through Addendum No. 52/2025 to the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM).

## Key Points

- Minimum application amount reduced from Rs. 500 to Rs. 100 for Growth Option
- Investment multiples remain at Re. 1 thereafter
- Change applies to Aditya Birla Sun Life Overnight Fund only
- Addendum No. 52/2025 issued to update scheme documentation
- All other terms and conditions of the scheme remain unchanged
- Notice dated December 3, 2025, issued from Mumbai

## Regulatory Changes

This is an operational modification to the scheme's investment parameters rather than a regulatory mandate. The change updates the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) to reflect the new minimum application thresholds. The amendment is implemented under the authority of Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited as the Investment Manager for Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors can now apply for the Growth Option with a minimum of Rs. 100 instead of Rs. 500
- All applications must still be in multiples of Re. 1 after meeting the minimum threshold
- Existing investors are not required to take any action; the change applies to new applications
- The updated SID and KIM with this addendum must be read together with all previous addenda

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 3, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 4, 2025 (Thursday)
- **Addendum Number**: 52/2025

## Impact Assessment

This change has a positive but limited impact on market accessibility. By reducing the minimum application amount from Rs. 500 to Rs. 100, the fund becomes more accessible to smaller retail investors and those seeking to make systematic investments with lower amounts. The overnight fund category typically serves liquidity management needs, and this lower threshold allows for more flexible cash management. However, the impact is confined to a single mutual fund scheme and does not affect broader market operations or trading activities. The change aligns with industry trends toward democratizing investment access and may attract new investors to the mutual fund platform.
