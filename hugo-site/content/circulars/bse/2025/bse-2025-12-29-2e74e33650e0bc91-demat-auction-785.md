## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational circular listing securities for scheduled demat auction settlement.

## Compliance Requirements

- Buying brokers must participate in the auction to fulfill delivery obligations for clients
- Selling brokers who failed to deliver must note the auction and potential buy-in consequences
- Members must settle auction obligations as per BSE auction settlement procedures
- Auction participants must ensure sufficient funds/securities for settlement

## Important Dates

- Settlement Date: December 29, 2025
- Auction execution date would typically be 1-2 trading days prior to settlement

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 90+ securities across multiple sectors. While individual quantities are relatively small for most scrips (under 1,000 shares), some notable quantities include ARC Finance (86,154), Wardwizard (21,006), and Indian Railway Finance (20,000).

**Operational Impact:** Brokers with outstanding delivery obligations in these securities must participate in the auction, potentially at unfavorable prices. This represents failure to deliver and may result in financial losses for the defaulting parties.

**Investor Impact:** Limited direct impact on retail investors. Primarily affects brokers with settlement failures. May cause temporary price volatility in affected securities during auction execution, particularly for lower-liquidity stocks with larger auction quantities.
