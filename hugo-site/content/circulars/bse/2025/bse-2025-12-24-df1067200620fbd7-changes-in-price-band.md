## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
The revised price bands indicate increased surveillance on these 26 securities, likely due to concerns about price volatility or unusual trading patterns. Tighter price bands (2%, 5%) restrict intraday price movement, potentially reducing speculative trading activity.

**Trading Impact:**
- Reduced intraday volatility for affected scrips
- Potential liquidity constraints due to tighter price movement limits
- Greater difficulty in executing large orders within single trading session
- Investors should adjust trading strategies for scrips with narrow price bands

**Investor Impact:**
Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware that price discovery may be affected by the narrower price bands, and larger price movements may require multiple trading sessions to materialize.
