title: Non-Business Day for certain schemes of Mutual Fund on BSE StAR MF Platform
  - UPDATE
---

## Summary

BSE has announced non-business days for certain mutual fund schemes on the BSE StAR MF Platform for November 2025. This affects specific fund of fund schemes from Bandhan Mutual Fund and Invesco India Mutual Fund on November 11 and November 27, 2025.

## Key Points

- Bandhan US Treasury Bond 0-1 year Fund of Fund will be closed on November 11, 2025
- Four Invesco India fund of fund schemes will be closed on November 11, 2025
- The same four Invesco India fund of fund schemes will also be closed on November 27, 2025
- Affected Invesco schemes include: Invesco Pan European Equity FoF, Invesco Global Equity Income FoF, Invesco Global Consumer Trends FoF, and Invesco EQQQ Nasdaq-100 ETF FoF
- No transactions will be processed for these schemes on the specified non-business days

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational update regarding fund holiday schedules.

## Compliance Requirements

Investors and distributors should note that:
- No purchase, redemption, or switch transactions will be accepted for the affected schemes on the specified non-business days
- Transaction requests should be planned accordingly around these closure dates

## Important Dates

- **November 11, 2025**: Non-business day for Bandhan US Treasury Bond 0-1 year FoF and all four Invesco India fund of fund schemes
- **November 27, 2025**: Non-business day for all four Invesco India fund of fund schemes

## Impact Assessment

The impact is minimal and localized to specific fund of fund schemes. Investors in these particular schemes need to be aware of the non-business days for transaction planning purposes. These closures are likely due to holidays in the underlying overseas markets where these fund of funds invest (US and European markets). The closure does not affect the broader BSE StAR MF platform or other mutual fund schemes.
