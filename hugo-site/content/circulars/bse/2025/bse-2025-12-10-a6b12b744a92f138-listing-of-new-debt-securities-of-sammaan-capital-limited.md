## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine listing of private placement debt securities with no put/call options. The securities are institutional in nature with high face value (Rs. 1 lakh per unit) and will have limited trading activity. The strong credit ratings (AA/Stable range) indicate low credit risk. Impact is confined to existing debt market participants and does not affect equity markets or broader trading operations.
