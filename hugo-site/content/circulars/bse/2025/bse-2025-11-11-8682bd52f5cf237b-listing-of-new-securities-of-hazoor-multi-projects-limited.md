## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The listing involves a relatively small number of shares (8,15,500) issued on preferential basis with complete lock-in restrictions until May 18, 2026. Since all shares are locked-in, there will be no immediate impact on tradable float or market liquidity.

**Shareholder Impact**: Affects only the non-promoter allottees who participated in the warrant conversion. The shares rank pari-passu with existing shares but cannot be traded during the lock-in period.

**Company Impact**: Increases the total share capital of Hazoor Multi Projects Limited. The preferential issue at Rs. 30/- per share (significant premium over face value) indicates capital raising for company operations.
