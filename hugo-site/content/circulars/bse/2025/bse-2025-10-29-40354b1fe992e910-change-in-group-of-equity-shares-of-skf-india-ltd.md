## Summary

BSE has announced that the equity shares of SKF INDIA LTD. (Scrip Code: 500472) will be transferred from the 'T' Group to the 'A' Group effective October 31, 2025. This change follows the earlier notice dated October 08, 2025, and represents an upgrade in the trading classification of the security.

## Key Points

- SKF INDIA LTD. equity shares (Scrip Code: 500472) will move from 'T' Group to 'A' Group

- Trading will be permitted under 'A' Group from the effective date
- Trading members are requested to take note of this change

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new group classification for SKF INDIA LTD.
- Members should ensure proper settlement procedures applicable to 'A' Group securities are followed from October 31, 2025

- **October 29, 2025**: Confirmation notice issued (Notice No. 20251029-25)
- **October 31, 2025**: Effective date for group change from 'T' to 'A'

## Impact Assessment

This group change is positive for SKF INDIA LTD. shareholders as it indicates:

- **Improved Trading Status**: Movement from 'T' Group to 'A' Group suggests the security has met criteria for normal trading
- **Enhanced Liquidity**: 'A' Group securities typically have better liquidity and lower transaction costs
- **Market Perception**: The upgrade may be viewed favorably by market participants
- **Settlement Changes**: Shift from potential trade-to-trade settlement to regular rolling settlement, improving trading flexibility

The impact is moderate as it primarily affects trading mechanics rather than fundamental business operations.
