## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective November 11, 2025. Eleven securities are being newly shortlisted under the ST-ASM framework, including several SME scrips. Two securities (G.K.P. Printing & Packaging Ltd and One Global Service Provider Ltd) are moving out of ST-ASM due to inclusion in the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework. United Cotfab Ltd will move to a lower stage within the ST-ASM framework while continuing under surveillance.

## Key Points

- 11 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework effective November 11, 2025
- 4 of the newly listed securities are SME scrips (marked with @)
- 2 securities are Global Surfaces Ltd and Raghav Productivity Enhancers Ltd (as per NSE)
- United Cotfab Ltd (SME scrip) moving to lower stage ASM while remaining in framework
- 2 securities exiting ST-ASM framework due to ESM Framework inclusion
- No securities moving to higher stage ASM in this update
- Consolidated list includes securities at Stage I of Short Term ASM, such as Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies additional surveillance measures to securities exhibiting unusual price movements or volatility over short time periods (5/15/30 days). Securities under this framework face enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions to protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with surveillance measures for affected securities
- Enhanced margin requirements may apply to securities under ST-ASM
- Market participants should note the stage classification for each security
- Special attention required for SME scrips marked with @ symbol
- Securities marked with specific symbols have additional framework applicability

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 11, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The inclusion of 11 securities in ST-ASM framework will likely result in reduced liquidity and increased trading costs for these stocks due to enhanced surveillance measures. The framework aims to curb excessive speculation and protect investors from abnormal volatility.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ST-ASM may face additional margin requirements, periodic call auctions, or other trading restrictions depending on their stage. The exit of 2 securities to ESM indicates they will face even stricter surveillance measures.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of potential liquidity constraints and higher transaction costs. The presence of multiple SME scrips in the list suggests heightened volatility concerns in the small-cap segment.
