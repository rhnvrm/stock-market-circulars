## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine corporate action with negligible impact on overall market operations.

**Stock-Specific Impact**: The dilution effect varies by company. IDFC First Bank and Sai Life Sciences have the largest absolute number of shares being listed (796,222 and 889,133 respectively), but the percentage dilution relative to total outstanding shares is expected to be marginal for all companies. The shares represent employee compensation and are typically absorbed by the market without significant price disruption.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minor increase in floating stock for the affected companies, which may marginally improve liquidity.

**Investor Considerations**: Existing shareholders should note the slight dilution in their holdings. However, ESOP/ESOS issuances are generally viewed positively as they align employee and shareholder interests.
