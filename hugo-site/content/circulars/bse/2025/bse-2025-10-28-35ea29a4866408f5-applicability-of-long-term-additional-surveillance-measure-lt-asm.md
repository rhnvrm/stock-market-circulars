title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has issued updates regarding the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective October 29, 2025. Three securities have been newly shortlisted under LT-ASM, one security (Megasoft Ltd) is being moved to Stage II ASM, and two securities are exiting the framework due to inclusion in GSM Framework. The circular also provides a consolidated list of all securities currently under various ASM stages.

## Key Points

- 3 new securities shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Mahip Industries Ltd, NMS Resources Global Ltd, and Shubham Polyspin Ltd
- Megasoft Ltd continues in LT-ASM but moves to Stage II
- 2 securities moving out of LT-ASM: Binny Mills Ltd and Bombay Talkies Ltd (both due to GSM inclusion)
- Changes effective from October 29, 2025
- Consolidated list includes 14+ securities across different ASM stages
- Part D (Direct Stage IV shortlisting) shows nil entries

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework continues BSE's enhanced surveillance approach for securities exhibiting specific risk characteristics. Securities under this framework face additional trading restrictions including:

- Enhanced margin requirements
- Trade-to-trade settlement
- Price bands and position limits
- Increased scrutiny of trading patterns

Stage progression indicates escalating surveillance levels based on continued risk factors.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ASM stage-specific requirements for affected securities
- Investors trading in LT-ASM securities must maintain higher margins as prescribed
- All trades in these securities will be settled on trade-to-trade basis with no netting off
- Risk management systems must be updated to reflect new ASM classifications
- Brokers should inform clients about the surveillance status of these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 29, 2025 - All changes to LT-ASM framework become applicable
- **Circular Date**: October 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities newly included in LT-ASM will face reduced liquidity due to trade-to-trade settlement and higher margin requirements. Megasoft Ltd moving to Stage II faces even stricter surveillance parameters.

**Investor Impact**: Existing positions in affected securities will require higher margins. New investors should be aware of enhanced risk profiles and trading restrictions.

**Market Impact**: The exit of Binny Mills Ltd and Bombay Talkies Ltd from LT-ASM to GSM Framework indicates shifting risk categorization, potentially subjecting them to different surveillance mechanisms.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update risk management systems, margin calculations, and client communications for all affected securities by the effective date.
