---

## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective August 18, 2025. Five new securities will be added to ESM, one security will move to a higher ESM stage, and 47 securities will move to lower ESM stages.

## Key Points

- 5 new securities added to ESM framework
- 1 security moved to higher ESM stage (R.S. Software India Ltd)
- 47 securities moved to lower ESM stages
- Changes effective from August 18, 2025
- Mix of main board and SME securities affected

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework continues with stage-based surveillance measures where securities can move between different levels based on risk assessment and market behavior.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the changed surveillance status of affected securities
- Trading in these securities will be subject to ESM conditions as per their respective stages
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance implications

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 18, 2025 - All ESM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The movement of securities between ESM stages affects trading conditions and investor participation. New additions to ESM may face trading restrictions, while securities moving to lower stages benefit from reduced surveillance measures. The significant number of securities moving to lower stages indicates improved market behavior for those companies.
