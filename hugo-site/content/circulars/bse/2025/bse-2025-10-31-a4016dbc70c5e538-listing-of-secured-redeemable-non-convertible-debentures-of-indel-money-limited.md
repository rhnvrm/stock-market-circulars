## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing of debt securities with limited market-wide impact. The listing provides investors with additional fixed-income investment options with varying tenures (1-6 years) and coupon rates (9.00%-12.25%). The IVR A-/STABLE rating indicates moderate credit quality. The large number of securities issued (particularly in Series V and VII with approximately 1 million NCDs each) suggests significant investor demand for these instruments. Impact is limited to debt market participants and existing/prospective investors in Indel Money Limited's debt instruments.
