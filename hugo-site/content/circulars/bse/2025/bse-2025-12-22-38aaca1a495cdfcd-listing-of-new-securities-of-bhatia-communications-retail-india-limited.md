## Impact Assessment

This listing represents a standard preferential allotment to non-promoters through warrant conversion. The issuance of 50 lakh shares will increase the equity base of Bhatia Communications & Retail (India) Limited. The lock-in period of approximately 6 months from the trading commencement date ensures that these shares cannot be sold until June 30, 2026, which limits immediate dilution impact on existing shareholders. The shares ranking pari-passu means they carry the same rights and privileges as existing equity shares.
