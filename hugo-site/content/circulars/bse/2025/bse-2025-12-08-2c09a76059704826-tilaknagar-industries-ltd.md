## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of 1.44 crore new shares represents a significant equity dilution event for existing shareholders. However, the immediate market impact is limited due to the lock-in restriction preventing these shares from being traded until June 30, 2026.

**Operational Impact**: The preferential allotment to Non-Promoters at Rs. 382 per share would have raised approximately Rs. 549 crore for the company, potentially strengthening its capital base for business expansion or debt reduction.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution in their holding percentage. The shares rank pari-passu, meaning new shareholders have equal rights to dividends, voting, and other corporate benefits.
