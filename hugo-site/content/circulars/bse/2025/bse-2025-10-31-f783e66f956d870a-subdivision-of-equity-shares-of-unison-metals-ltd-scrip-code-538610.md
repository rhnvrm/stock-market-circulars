Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs.10/- will be subdivided into ten equity shares with a face value of Re.1/- each. The record date for this subdivision has been fixed as November 28, 2025, and the new sub-divided shares will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Subdivision Ratio: 1:10 (One share of Rs.10/- into ten shares of Re.1/-)
- Record Date: November 28, 2025
- Effective Date: November 28, 2025
- Current ISIN: INE099D01018 (Rs.10/- paid up)
- New ISIN: To be informed separately by BSE

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action permitted under company law where the face value of shares is reduced proportionally while increasing the number of shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- **For Trading Members**: Take note of the record date and ISIN changes for transaction processing
- **For Depositories and Participants**: Update records to reflect the subdivision in shareholder accounts
- **For Investors**: No action required; shares will be automatically credited in subdivided form post-record date
- **Important**: The existing ISIN INE099D01018 will become invalid for exchange transactions from November 28, 2025 onwards

## Important Dates

- **October 31, 2025**: Circular issued by BSE
- **November 28, 2025**: Record Date for subdivision
- **November 28, 2025**: Effective date - sub-divided shares of Re.1/- become valid for trading
- **November 28, 2025**: Old ISIN (INE099D01018) becomes invalid for transactions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The subdivision increases the number of outstanding shares by a factor of 10 while reducing the face value proportionally. This makes shares more affordable for retail investors and may improve liquidity. The market capitalization remains unchanged.

**Trading Impact**: From November 28, 2025, all trading must occur using the new ISIN. The old ISIN will not be valid for exchange transactions. Trading members must ensure their systems are updated to reflect the new share structure.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. The proportional ownership and total value of holdings remain the same. Shares will be automatically credited to demat accounts in the new denomination.

**Liquidity Impact**: Lower price per share post-subdivision typically attracts more retail participation and can enhance trading volumes and market liquidity.
