## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - provides liquidity window for shareholders who wish to renounce their rights entitlements rather than subscribe to the issue.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure proper client communication and include mandatory disclaimers in contract notes. The 3-day renunciation window is relatively short, requiring prompt action from shareholders.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders of NACL Industries have options to: (1) subscribe to the rights issue, (2) renounce and trade their REs during December 22-24, or (3) allow REs to lapse. Critical to note that unexercised REs become worthless after December 30, 2025.
