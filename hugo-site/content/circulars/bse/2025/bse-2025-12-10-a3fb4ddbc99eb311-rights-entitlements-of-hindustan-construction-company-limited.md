## Summary

BSE has announced that Rights Entitlements (REs) for renunciation of HINDUSTAN CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED will be available for trading from December 12, 2025 to December 17, 2025. The underlying Rights Issue will be open from December 12, 2025 to December 22, 2025. Trading will be conducted on T+1 rolling settlement basis, trade-for-trade, and in dematerialized form only.

- ISIN: INE549A20026
- Market Lot: 1
- Group: R
- Settlement basis: T+1 Rolling Settlement, trade-for-trade

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational notice for rights entitlements trading pursuant to existing BSE procedures outlined in notices dated March 05, 2020 (20200305-21) and May 18, 2020 (20200518-34).

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Inform all clients about commencement of RE trading with the specific ISIN (INE549A20026)
- Clarify that REs are not ordinary shares of the company
- Include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases stating:
  - Purchase of REs only grants right to participate in the Rights Issue by applying with requisite application money, or to renounce the REs
  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced by Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished
- Ensure trades are settled on trade-for-trade basis
- Refer to reference notices 20200305-21 and 20200518-34 for complete procedural details

**For Investors:**
- REs must be traded in dematerialized form only
- Must either subscribe with application money or renounce before December 22, 2025
- Unexercised REs will lapse after Issue Closing Date

## Important Dates

- **December 10, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **December 12, 2025**: 
  - Rights Entitlements trading begins
  - Rights Issue opens
- **December 17, 2025**: Last day for RE renunciation trading
- **December 22, 2025**: Rights Issue closes (last day to subscribe or renounce)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium. This affects existing HCC shareholders who receive Rights Entitlements and traders interested in short-term RE trading opportunities. The 6-day renunciation window provides limited liquidity window.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure proper client communication and contract note disclaimers are in place. The trade-for-trade settlement requirement means no netting of positions.

**Investor Impact:** HCC shareholders must decide within the trading/issue period whether to exercise rights, sell REs, or allow them to lapse. Failure to act by December 22, 2025 results in extinguishment of entitlements with no compensation.
