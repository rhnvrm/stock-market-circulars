## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction involves 101 scrips indicating delivery failures across diverse securities. While most quantities are small, some scrips like IRB Infrastructure (50,000 shares) represent significant volumes that could impact price discovery during the auction.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and clearing members with outstanding delivery obligations must arrange funds and participate in the auction mechanism. Failed deliveries trigger buy-in auctions which can result in financial penalties for defaulting sellers.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders expecting delivery of these securities will receive them through the auction process, though potentially at different prices than the original transaction. The wide range of securities (from 1 share to 50,000 shares) suggests scattered delivery failures rather than systemic issues.
