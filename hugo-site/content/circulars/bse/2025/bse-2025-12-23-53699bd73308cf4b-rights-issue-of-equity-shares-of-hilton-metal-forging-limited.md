## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must execute all transactions in Hilton Metal Forging Limited shares on an ex-rights basis from December 26, 2025
- Shareholders on record as of December 26, 2025 will be eligible to participate in the rights issue
- All trades settling from December 26, 2025 onwards will be without rights entitlement

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: December 26, 2025 - Eligibility cutoff for rights issue participation
- **Ex-Rights Trading Date**: December 26, 2025 (Settlement DR-785/2025-2026)
- **Notice Date**: December 23, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders holding shares as of the record date will receive rights entitlements allowing them to subscribe to additional shares at Rs 28.32 per share, representing potential dilution if rights are not exercised.

**Market Impact**: The ex-rights adjustment will typically result in a proportional reduction in share price from December 26, 2025 to reflect the dilutive effect of the rights issue. Trading members must account for this in their order execution.

**Liquidity Impact**: Moderate - rights issues can temporarily affect trading patterns as shareholders decide whether to exercise, sell, or renounce their rights. The relatively modest ratio (14:29 or approximately 48% of existing holding) suggests a moderate capital raise.
