## Regulatory Framework

The ST-ASM framework is designed to:
- Monitor securities with unusual price/volume movements
- Apply graded surveillance measures (Stage I, II, etc.)
- Restrict trading to protect investor interests
- Move securities between stages based on ongoing assessment
- Remove securities when concerns are addressed

Securities may exit ST-ASM due to:
- Inclusion in LT-ASM Framework

- Inclusion in Pledge Framework
- Inclusion in ESM Framework

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must implement enhanced surveillance protocols for listed securities
- **Investors**: Should be aware of trading restrictions on ST-ASM securities
- **Listed Companies**: Subject to heightened monitoring and potential additional disclosure requirements
- **Market Participants**: Must comply with any trading limitations imposed under the framework

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 10, 2025
- All changes to ST-ASM classification take effect from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

### Market Impact:
- **Liquidity**: Securities under ST-ASM typically face reduced liquidity due to enhanced surveillance measures
- **Trading**: May involve additional margin requirements, price bands, or other restrictions
- **Investor Confidence**: Framework aims to protect investors from excessive speculation

### Operational Impact:
- Trading members must update surveillance systems
- Risk management protocols need adjustment for affected securities
- Investors holding these securities may face trading limitations
- Higher stages of ASM involve progressively stricter measures

### Sectoral Impact:
- Includes diverse sectors: power equipment, finance, technology, metals, logistics
- Both large-cap (Kesoram, Kaynes Technology) and SME securities affected
- Signals regulatory focus on price stability across market segments
