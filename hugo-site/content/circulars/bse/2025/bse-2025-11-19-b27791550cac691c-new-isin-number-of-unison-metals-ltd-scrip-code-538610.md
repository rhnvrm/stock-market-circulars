- DR Number: 766/2025-2026
- Notice Reference: Continuation of Notice No. 20251031-13 dated October 31, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action notification regarding ISIN modification following share sub-division as per existing SEBI guidelines.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN INE099D01026
- All trades from November 28, 2025 onwards must be executed using the new ISIN
- Depository participants should ensure demat accounts reflect the sub-divided shares with new ISIN
- Market participants must adjust their records to reflect the 10:1 share split ratio

## Important Dates

- **October 31, 2025**: Original notice date (Reference: Notice No. 20251031-13)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division from Rs.10 to Re.1 (10:1 ratio) will increase the number of outstanding shares tenfold, potentially improving liquidity and making shares more affordable for retail investors. The ISIN change is administrative but critical for proper trade settlement.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members, depository participants, and investors must ensure their systems and records are updated with the new ISIN to avoid settlement failures. Existing shareholders will see their holdings adjusted automatically in demat accounts post ex-date.

**Investor Action**: Existing shareholders need not take any action as the conversion will happen automatically. New buyers from November 28, 2025 onwards will receive shares with Re.1 face value under the new ISIN.
