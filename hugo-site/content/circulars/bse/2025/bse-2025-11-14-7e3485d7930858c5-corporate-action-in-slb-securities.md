## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects liquidity in SLB segment for 23 securities over 8 trading days. Market participants with short positions or hedging strategies using SLB must plan accordingly.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and institutional investors utilizing SLB for short-selling, hedging, or arbitrage strategies need to adjust positions before shut periods. The staggered timing (November 13-21) allows for sequential management of exposures.

**Investor Impact:** Dividend announcements are positive for long-term holders. Rights issue by Adani Enterprises provides growth capital opportunity but may create short-term price pressure. SLB restrictions temporarily reduce short-selling pressure during corporate action periods.

**Sector Concentration:** Multiple sectors affected including Oil & Gas (ONGC), Infrastructure (IRB, NBCC, Adani), Paints (Asian Paints), IT Services (Sonata, Info Edge), PSUs (RITES, Cochin Shipyard, Container Corp, IRCTC, MOIL), and Consumer Goods (Page Industries).
