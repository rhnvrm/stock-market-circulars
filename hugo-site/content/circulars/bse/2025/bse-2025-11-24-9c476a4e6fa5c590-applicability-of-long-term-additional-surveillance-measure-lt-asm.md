title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has updated the list of securities under the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective November 25, 2025. The circular identifies securities being newly added to LT-ASM, those moving between ASM stages, and one security (TCM Ltd) being removed from the framework due to inclusion in ESM Framework. The LT-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance and trading restrictions on securities exhibiting specific price movement patterns.

## Key Points

- 3 new securities added to Long Term ASM Framework: Gopal Iron & Steels Company Gujarat Ltd, Phyto Chem India Ltd, and Vaarad Ventures Ltd
- 3 securities moved to higher ASM Stage II: Gold Coin Health Foods Ltd, Nanavati Ventures Ltd, and Sri Adhikari Brothers Television Network Ltd
- No securities moved to lower ASM stages
- No securities added directly to Stage IV
- TCM Ltd removed from LT-ASM Framework due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- Changes apply to both regular and T+0 scrips where applicable

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework continues BSE's surveillance mechanism for securities showing unusual price movements over extended periods. Securities in LT-ASM face:
- Staged surveillance measures (Stage I through Stage IV)
- Enhanced margin requirements
- Potential trading restrictions
- Regular review for movement between stages or exit from framework

Securities may exit LT-ASM upon inclusion in other frameworks: Trade for Trade, GSM (Graded Surveillance Measure), ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure), or IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) Framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable margin requirements for LT-ASM securities
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance conditions when trading these securities
- Brokers must communicate LT-ASM status to clients trading affected securities
- Market participants should review position limits and trading restrictions applicable to each ASM stage

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 25, 2025 - All changes to LT-ASM framework take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Moderate impact on liquidity for the 6 affected securities. Securities in LT-ASM typically experience reduced trading volumes due to higher margins and increased scrutiny.

**Investor Impact**: Existing investors in these securities will face enhanced margin requirements. New investors should exercise caution given the surveillance framework applicability.

**Trading Impact**: Securities moving to Stage II face progressively stricter surveillance measures. TCM Ltd moving to ESM represents an escalation in regulatory oversight with potentially tighter restrictions than LT-ASM.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update risk management systems to reflect new ASM classifications and ensure proper margin collection for these securities.
