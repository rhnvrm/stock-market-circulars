**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their systems before December 17, 2025 to accommodate new ISIN and scrip parameters. The coupon rate change from fixed to reset mechanism requires updated valuation and pricing models.

**Investor Impact:** Bondholders will experience a change in interest rate structure from predictable fixed 11% returns to variable reset rate returns, introducing interest rate risk and potential return variability.
