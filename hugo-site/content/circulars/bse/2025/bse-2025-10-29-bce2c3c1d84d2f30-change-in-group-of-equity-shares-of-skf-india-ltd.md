## Summary

BSE has announced that equity shares of SKF INDIA LTD. (Scrip Code: 500472) will be transferred from 'T' Group to 'A' Group effective October 31, 2025. This change follows the earlier notice dated October 08, 2025, and will permit normal trading in the company's equity shares under the 'A' Group.

## Key Points

- SKF INDIA LTD. (Scrip Code: 500472) will move from 'T' Group to 'A' Group
- Trading will be permitted under 'A' Group framework
- Change is in continuation to Exchange Notice No. 20251008-60 dated October 08, 2025
- All trading members are required to take note of this change

## Regulatory Changes

The security will transition from Trade-to-Trade ('T' Group) settlement to normal rolling settlement ('A' Group). This removes the restriction where each transaction required compulsory delivery, allowing for normal intraday trading and settlement cycles.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the group change
- Members should ensure proper classification of SKF INDIA LTD. shares as 'A' Group securities from the effective date
- All trades from October 31, 2025 onwards must follow 'A' Group settlement mechanisms

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 29, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 31, 2025
- **Previous Related Notice**: October 08, 2025 (Notice No. 20251008-60)

## Impact Assessment

This change positively impacts the stock's liquidity as it moves from the restrictive Trade-to-Trade segment to the regular 'A' Group. The 'A' Group classification allows for intraday trading, better price discovery, and improved market participation. Investors will benefit from enhanced liquidity and reduced settlement restrictions. This typically indicates that the company has met compliance requirements that previously necessitated T-Group classification.
