## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects trading schedules for Currency Derivatives and Debt market participants only, not equity markets.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and market participants in Currency Derivatives and Debt Segments must plan around 19 non-trading days in 2026. This affects liquidity planning, settlement cycles, and operational resource allocation. The Muhurat Trading session on Diwali provides a special ceremonial trading opportunity.

**Planning Considerations:** Members should note the concentration of holidays in March-April (6 holidays) and plan accordingly for reduced trading days during that period.
