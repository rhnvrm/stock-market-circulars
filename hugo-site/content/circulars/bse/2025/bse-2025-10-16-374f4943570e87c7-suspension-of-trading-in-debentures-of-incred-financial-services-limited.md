## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of these specific NCD series. The suspension is temporary and procedural, related to the final redemption of the debentures.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will receive their principal redemption amount and final interest payment if they hold the securities as of the record date. Secondary market liquidity ceases from October 24, 2025.
