## Summary

BSE has announced a change in the underlying asset name for Tata Motors Ltd (scrip code 500570) in the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) segment. The old underlying scrip name 'TATAMOTORS' with product code 'TATAMOTORS' will be changed to 'TATA MOTORS PASSENGER VEHICLES LIMITED' with product code 'TMPV'. This change will be reflected in the SLB_CMDDMMYY file effective October 24, 2025.

## Key Points

- Underlying asset: Tata Motors Ltd (Scrip Code: 500570)
- Old product code: TATAMOTORS
- New product code: TMPV
- Old underlying scrip name: Tata Motors Ltd (TATAMOTORS)
- New underlying scrip name: TATA MOTORS PASSENGER VEHICLES LIMITED
- File affected: SLB_CMDDMMYY (end of day contract master file)
- No changes to any other trading parameters

## Regulatory Changes

This is a nomenclature update in the SLB segment reflecting the corporate identity change. The underlying asset name and product code are being updated in the contract master file to reflect 'TATA MOTORS PASSENGER VEHICLES LIMITED' instead of the previous 'Tata Motors Ltd' designation.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members should:
- Note the change in underlying asset name in the SLB_CMDDMMYY file
- Update their internal systems to recognize the new product code 'TMPV'
- Be aware that all other parameters remain unchanged
- Ensure proper recognition of the renamed underlying asset in SLB transactions

## Important Dates

- **October 23, 2025**: Changes incorporated in end of day contract master file
- **October 24, 2025**: Effective date for the name change in SLB segment

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this change is minimal as it is purely administrative. No trading parameters, settlement processes, or operational procedures are affected. Trading members need only update their internal reference systems to reflect the new underlying asset name and product code. The change appears to align with Tata Motors' corporate restructuring separating its passenger vehicle business.
