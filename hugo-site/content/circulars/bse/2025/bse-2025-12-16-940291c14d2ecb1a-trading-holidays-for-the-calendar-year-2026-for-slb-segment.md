**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants need to adjust their operational calendars, settlement schedules, and business planning to account for these 15 non-trading days. The inclusion of Muhurat Trading provides an additional special trading opportunity during Diwali.

**Planning Considerations**: With holidays spread throughout the year, participants should note clusters in March-April (4 holidays) and October-November (3 holidays plus Muhurat Trading), which may affect liquidity and settlement cycles in the SLB segment during those periods.
