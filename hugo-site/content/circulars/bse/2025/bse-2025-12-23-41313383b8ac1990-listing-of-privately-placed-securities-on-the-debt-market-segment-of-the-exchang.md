The securities are institutional-grade instruments with high credit ratings (CRISIL AAA/Stable, ICRA AAA/Stable) and will primarily be traded among institutional investors and debt market participants.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Trading members dealing in debt securities need to note the new scrip details for their systems. The securities follow standard debt segment trading protocols with dematerialized trading requirements and 1 paise tick size.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to debt market participants and investors interested in REIT-issued debt instruments. The high face value (Rs. 1,00,000) indicates these are designed for institutional or high-net-worth investors rather than retail participants.
