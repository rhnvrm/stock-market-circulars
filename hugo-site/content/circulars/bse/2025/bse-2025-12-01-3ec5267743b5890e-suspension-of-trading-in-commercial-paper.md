## Impact Assessment

The impact is moderate and limited to the debt market segment. The suspension affects commercial paper trading for 17 diverse companies spanning financial services, housing finance, media, power, and other sectors. Since these are scheduled redemptions, the market impact is expected and manageable. Investors in these instruments will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms of their investments. The concentration of 14 redemptions on December 9, 2025 indicates a clustering of maturity dates but represents normal market activity rather than systemic concerns.
