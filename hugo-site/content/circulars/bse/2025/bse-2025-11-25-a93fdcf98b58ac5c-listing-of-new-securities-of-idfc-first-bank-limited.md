## Impact Assessment

This preferential allotment represents a significant equity dilution with over 43 crore new shares being issued. The conversion from CCPS to equity shares strengthens the capital structure by converting preference capital to equity. The lock-in period until August 2026 ensures that these shares will not be available for trading in the near term, limiting immediate supply impact. The shares being issued to non-promoters indicates expansion of public shareholding. Investors should monitor the impact on earnings per share and voting rights distribution.
