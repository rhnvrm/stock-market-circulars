## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine settlement mechanism to address delivery failures. Demat auctions are standard procedures when sellers fail to deliver securities.

**Operational Impact:** Low to Medium - Affects specific brokers/members who have delivery shortages in the listed securities. They will need to purchase these securities through the auction at potentially higher prices.

**Investor Impact:** Low - Direct impact limited to specific shareholders involved in failed delivery transactions. May result in higher costs for brokers covering shortages, which could be passed to clients who failed to deliver.
