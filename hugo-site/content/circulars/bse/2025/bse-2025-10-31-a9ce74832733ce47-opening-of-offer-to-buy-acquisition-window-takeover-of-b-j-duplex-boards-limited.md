## Regulatory Changes

## Impact Assessment

**Corporate Impact**: This is a significant corporate action involving change in control of B J Duplex Boards Limited, with the acquirers seeking to purchase a substantial 26% stake. The low offer price of Re. 1 per share (equal to face value) may indicate either financial distress of the target company or a strategic acquisition at nominal value.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders must evaluate whether to tender their shares at the offered price. The offer provides an exit opportunity at Re. 1 per share. Shareholders who do not participate will continue holding shares in a company with changed control structure.

**Market Impact**: The acquisition will result in change of control and management of the target company. The 26% acquisition through open offer route indicates this is part of a larger transaction where the acquirers may have already acquired or will acquire additional stake through other means to achieve majority control.

**Regulatory Compliance**: The offer follows mandatory SEBI SAST regulations, ensuring protection of minority shareholders through the open offer mechanism when control changes hands.
