Trading members are informed to note the listing of these new securities for trading purposes. All 20,00,000 shares are subject to mandatory lock-in requirements.

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: October 29, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: December 11, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action involving preferential allotment to non-promoters. The issue represents a modest equity dilution with all shares subject to 8-month lock-in period until June 29, 2026. Market impact is expected to be minimal given the small issue size and lock-in restrictions that prevent immediate trading of these shares by allottees.
