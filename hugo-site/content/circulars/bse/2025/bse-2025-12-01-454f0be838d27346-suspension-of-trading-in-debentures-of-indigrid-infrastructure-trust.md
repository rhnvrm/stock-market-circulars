## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The suspension affects only specific debentures of INDIGRID INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST and does not impact the broader market or other securities of the issuer.

**Investor Impact**: Medium to High for debenture holders - Investors holding these debentures cannot trade them from December 11, 2025. However, this is a planned corporate action for redemption and interest payment, which is a positive event for holders who will receive their principal and interest.
