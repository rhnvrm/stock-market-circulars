## Summary

BSE has announced that the equity shares of WESTERN OVERSEAS STUDY ABROAD LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544636), currently listed on the SME platform, will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to the Rolling settlement segment (M Group) effective December 26, 2025. This follows the exchange's previous notice dated December 10, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: WESTERN OVERSEAS STUDY ABROAD LIMITED (SME IPO)
- Scrip Code: 544636
- Current segment: Trade for Trade segment (MT Group)
- New segment: Rolling segment (M Group)
- Effective date: Friday, December 26, 2025
- Notice references: Continuation of Notice No. 20251210-53 dated December 10, 2025
- Contact: Mr. Anurag Jain, Tel: 022-2272 8822

## Regulatory Changes

The equity shares will transition from restrictive Trade for Trade settlement to regular Rolling settlement, allowing for more flexible trading mechanisms. This change indicates the company has met the requirements to graduate from the more restrictive trading framework typically applied to new SME listings.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new group classification (M Group) for Scrip Code 544636
- All trading in the shares must comply with Rolling segment rules from December 26, 2025
- Trading members requiring clarification should contact the designated BSE official

## Important Dates

- **December 10, 2025**: Initial notice issued (Notice No. 20251210-53)
- **December 11, 2025**: Current notice date confirming the change
- **December 26, 2025**: Effective date for transfer to Rolling segment (M Group)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The transition from Trade for Trade to Rolling settlement is generally positive for stock liquidity. Trade for Trade segments require full upfront payment and delivery, restricting trading activity. Moving to Rolling settlement (M Group) allows for T+2 settlement cycles and potentially higher trading volumes.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and trading protocols for this scrip. The change may attract more traders as Rolling settlement offers better flexibility compared to the restrictive Trade for Trade mechanism.

**Investor Impact**: Enhanced liquidity and easier trading mechanisms for existing and potential investors in WESTERN OVERSEAS STUDY ABROAD LIMITED shares.
