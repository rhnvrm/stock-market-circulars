---

## Summary

Fischer Medical Ventures Ltd (Scrip Code: 524743) has announced the subdivision of its existing equity shares. Each equity share of face value Rs. 10/- will be subdivided into 10 equity shares of face value Re. 1/- each, with the record date set as September 12, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Fischer Medical Ventures Ltd (Scrip Code: 524743)
- Record Date: September 12, 2025
- Subdivision ratio: 1 share of Rs. 10/- into 10 shares of Re. 1/- each
- Current ISIN (INE771F01025) will become invalid from September 12, 2025
- New ISIN for Re. 1/- shares to be announced separately
- Effective date: September 12, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE771F01025 for Rs. 10/- paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after September 12, 2025. A new ISIN number for the Re. 1/- paid-up shares will be communicated through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date for subdivision
- Existing shareholders will automatically receive subdivided shares
- New ISIN to be used for all transactions from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: September 12, 2025
- **Effective Date**: September 12, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The subdivision will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10 times while reducing the face value proportionally. This corporate action typically aims to improve liquidity and make shares more affordable for retail investors. Existing shareholders' total value remains unchanged, but they will hold 10 times more shares at 1/10th the face value.
