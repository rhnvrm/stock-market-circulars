This follows a consultation paper from February 2024 and Board approval for amending SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 2018 and SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. The circular aims to prevent generation of unclaimed assets and ensure uniform approach across securities market for nomination in demat accounts and mutual fund folios.
