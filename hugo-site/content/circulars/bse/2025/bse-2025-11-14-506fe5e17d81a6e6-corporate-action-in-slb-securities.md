- Ex-dates coincide with record dates for most securities

- No new SLB positions can be created during the shut period

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The notification affects 23 actively traded securities across various sectors including oil & gas, IT, railways, shipping, paints, and infrastructure. The shut periods will temporarily restrict SLB activity for these securities.

**Operational Impact:** SLB participants must plan their lending and borrowing strategies around the specified shut periods. The concentration of corporate actions in the third week of November may lead to reduced liquidity in the SLB segment for these securities.

**Investor Impact:** Dividend-seeking investors and those participating in the Adani Enterprises rights issue must ensure they hold shares before the respective ex-dates to be eligible for benefits. SLB borrowers need to be aware of potential difficulties in rolling over positions during shut periods.
