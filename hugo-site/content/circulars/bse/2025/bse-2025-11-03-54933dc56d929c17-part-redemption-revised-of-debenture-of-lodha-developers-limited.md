## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - This revision affects debenture holders and trading members dealing with LODHA DEVELOPERS LIMITED debt securities. The reduced face value post-redemption will impact the trading price and valuation of these debentures.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face value of Rs. 94,395/- per debenture from November 04, 2025. This is a continuation/revision of a previously announced corporate action, so members should already have processes in place but need to update the specific face value amount.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will receive part redemption, reducing the face value from the original amount to Rs. 94,395/- per debenture. This affects the outstanding principal amount and future interest calculations for holders of these securities.
