## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High impact for holders of these specific debentures. The trading suspension prevents any secondary market transactions, meaning investors cannot buy or sell these securities during the suspension period. This is standard practice to establish a clear record of debenture holders for redemption and interest payment purposes.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders should expect redemption proceeds and final interest payment based on holdings as of the October 26, 2025 record date. Those looking to exit positions should have done so before October 24, 2025. New investors cannot acquire these debentures during the suspension period.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trading in this security and communicate the suspension to affected clients. The suspension will remain until the redemption process is completed.
