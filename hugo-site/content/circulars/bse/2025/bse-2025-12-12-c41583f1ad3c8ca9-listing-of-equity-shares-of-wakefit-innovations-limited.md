**Investor Impact:**
- Public investors and certain AIF investors have immediate trading flexibility
- Anchor investors face short-term restrictions (30-90 days)
- Long-term investors (promoters/early investors) locked in for up to 18 months ensures management commitment
- ESOP holders with no lock-in can realize value immediately

**Company Impact:**
- Successful IPO listing establishes public market presence
- Lock-in structure demonstrates promoter confidence and long-term commitment
- Access to capital markets for future fundraising opportunities
