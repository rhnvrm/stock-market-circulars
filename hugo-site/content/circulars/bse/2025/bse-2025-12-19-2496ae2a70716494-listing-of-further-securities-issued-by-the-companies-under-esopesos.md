A total of 2,851,543 shares across various companies are being listed, with no lock-in restrictions applicable to any of the listed securities.

- All shares admitted to trading effective December 22, 2025
- No lock-in period applicable (all entries marked as NA)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine notification for listing of shares issued pursuant to existing ESOP/ESOS schemes as per SEBI guidelines.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements for market participants. The listing is informational and the companies have already completed necessary formalities for share issuance under their respective ESOP/ESOS schemes.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 19, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: December 22, 2025 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (no lock-in restrictions)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. ESOP share listings represent incremental supply from employee stock options being exercised, which is a routine corporate action. The quantities are relatively small compared to the free float of these large-cap companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible impact on overall liquidity as the share counts are modest relative to daily trading volumes of these actively traded stocks.

**Dilution Impact**: Marginal dilution to existing shareholders as ESOP issuances are typically factored into diluted earnings per share calculations and are expected corporate actions.

**Company-Specific Notes**:
- Yes Bank's 1.1 million shares represent the largest single issuance
- All shares are immediately tradeable with no lock-in restrictions
- Distribution numbers have been allocated sequentially to the new shares
