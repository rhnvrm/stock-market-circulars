title: 'Sub-division of Equity Shares of ZYDUS WELLNESS LTD (Scrip Code: 531335)'
---

## Summary

Zydus Wellness Ltd (Scrip Code: 531335) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of Rs.10 face value will be sub-divided into 5 equity shares of Rs.2 face value each. The record date for this corporate action is September 18, 2025.

## Key Points

- Existing equity shares of Rs.10 each will be sub-divided into 5 shares of Rs.2 each
- Record date fixed as September 18, 2025
- Current ISIN INE768C01010 (Rs.10 paid-up) will become invalid for trading from September 18, 2025
- New ISIN for Rs.2 paid-up shares to be communicated separately
- Applies to dematerialised securities under rolling settlement

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE768C01010 for Rs.10 paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after September 18, 2025. A new ISIN number for the Rs.2 paid-up shares will be issued and communicated to the market through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must ensure they are aware of the share subdivision and the change in ISIN numbers for proper settlement and trading operations post the effective date.

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: September 18, 2025
- **Effective Date**: September 18, 2025 (when new share structure becomes operational)
- **Notice Date**: September 1, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The share subdivision will increase the number of shares outstanding by a factor of 5 while proportionally reducing the face value. This typically makes shares more affordable for retail investors and may improve liquidity. Shareholders will receive 5 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. The total value of holdings remains unchanged, but the number of shares and per-share price will adjust accordingly.
