## Regulatory Changes

This circular represents a surveillance measure where BSE adjusts circuit filters (price bands) to control excessive volatility in specific securities. Price bands restrict how much a stock price can move up or down during a trading session compared to the previous closing price.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement the revised price bands in their trading systems before market opening on November 7, 2025
- All orders and trades in these securities must comply with the new price band limits
- Members requiring clarifications should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 6, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 7, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The revision of price bands is a surveillance mechanism to manage volatility and ensure orderly trading. Securities with tighter 5% bands will experience more frequent circuit triggers if volatility persists, potentially limiting intraday price movements. Securities with 10% bands have more room for price discovery but are still under enhanced surveillance. This impacts day traders, algorithmic trading strategies, and investors who need to adjust their order placement and risk management approaches for these specific securities. The changes suggest these stocks have exhibited unusual price movements warranting closer monitoring by the exchange.
