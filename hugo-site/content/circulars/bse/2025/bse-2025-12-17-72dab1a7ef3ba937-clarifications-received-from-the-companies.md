- Digjam confirmed all material events have been disclosed under Regulation 30 of SEBI LODR Regulations
- Aerpace Industries attributed price movement to previously disclosed public information
- Aerpace referenced two specific disclosures: appointment of Mr. Prakash Gaur as Non-Executive Director (effective September 26, 2025) and execution of MoU with Government of Andhra Pradesh
- Both companies reiterated their commitment to timely disclosure requirements
- Responses were provided to both BSE and NSE surveillance departments

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This circular contains routine compliance disclosures.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. Companies reaffirmed their adherence to:
- Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015
- Timely disclosure of price-sensitive information and material events

## Important Dates

Both companies confirmed no undisclosed material events, suggesting price movements were market-driven based on publicly available information. The clarifications provide transparency but do not reveal new information that would affect trading or investment decisions.
