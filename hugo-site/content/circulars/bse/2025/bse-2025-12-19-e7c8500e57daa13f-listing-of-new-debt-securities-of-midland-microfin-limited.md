## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine private placement debt listing affecting only investors in Midland Microfin's debt securities. The zero coupon structure means no periodic cash flows, with returns realized at maturity or through secondary market trading.

**Investor Impact**: Low to moderate for debt market participants. The CARE BBB+/Negative rating indicates moderate credit quality with some concerns reflected in the negative outlook. The put option provides investors with downside protection. Total issue size of Rs. 20 crores (2,000 securities × Rs. 100,000) represents a relatively small debt issuance.

**Operational Impact**: None for equity market participants. Debt traders should note the tick size of 1 paise and market lot of 1 unit for order placement.
