## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in equity shares of Rolta India Limited (Scrip Code: 500366) effective December 17, 2025, following the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Mumbai Bench's approval of a resolution plan under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The approved resolution plan mandates complete cancellation of all existing issued, subscribed and paid-up share capital, with all shareholder rights being extinguished and written-off without any payment to existing shareholders.

## Key Points

- All shareholder rights will be extinguished and written-off without any payment
- Cancellation occurs simultaneously with issuance of new equity shares on Transfer Date
- Trading suspended to avoid market complications
- Suspension effective from December 17, 2025

## Compliance Requirements

- **Transfer Date**: Date when existing shares will be cancelled and new equity shares will be issued (specific date to be determined as per resolution plan)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Complete trading suspension eliminates liquidity for existing shareholders. The stock becomes untradeable on BSE, preventing any exit opportunity for current investors.
