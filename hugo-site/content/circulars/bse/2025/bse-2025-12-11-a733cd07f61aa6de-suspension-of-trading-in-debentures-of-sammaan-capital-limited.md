## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The suspension affects multiple debenture series but is limited to one issuer. This is a procedural suspension related to scheduled corporate actions rather than regulatory concerns.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will receive their final interest payment and principal redemption as scheduled. However, secondary market liquidity is eliminated from the suspension date, preventing any exit or entry for investors during the final two weeks before maturity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trades in these five ISINs and communicate the suspension to clients holding these debentures. The short notice period (4 days) requires prompt action by brokers and dealers.
