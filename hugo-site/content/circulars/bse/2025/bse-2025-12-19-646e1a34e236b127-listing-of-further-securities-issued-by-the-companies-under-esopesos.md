## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal to negligible. The aggregate number of shares being listed (2.85 million) represents a small fraction of the outstanding equity for these large-cap and mid-cap companies. ESOP issuances are routine corporate actions that typically have limited immediate price impact.

**Liquidity Impact:** Marginal increase in tradable float for each company. The staggered nature of ESOP conversions means these shares enter the market gradually through employee transactions.

**Dilution Impact:** Minor dilution of existing shareholders' equity, already anticipated in companies' authorized capital structures.

**Stakeholder Impact:** Positive for employees exercising their stock options, standard administrative process for listed companies maintaining equity compensation programs.
