- Trading members are informed to update their systems for the additional shares
- No specific compliance actions required from market participants
- Companies have completed necessary formalities for listing these ESOP/ESOS shares

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 3, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: December 4, 2025
- **Lock-in Period**: Not applicable for any of the listed securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal to negligible. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares represents standard corporate actions for employee compensation schemes. The quantities being listed are relatively small compared to existing share capital for most companies, with the exception of Vishal Mega Mart's larger issuance of 1.9+ million shares.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in floating stock for the affected companies. No lock-in restrictions mean these shares are immediately tradable, though actual selling pressure will depend on employee decisions.

**Investor Consideration**: Dilution effect is minimal given the small percentages relative to total outstanding shares. ESOP listings are routine occurrences and typically already factored into market expectations.
