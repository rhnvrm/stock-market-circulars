## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders as of the record date will be entitled to subscribe to 1 new share for every 2 shares held. Shareholders who do not participate will face dilution of their ownership percentage.

**Market Impact**: The stock will trade ex-rights from November 20, 2025, which typically results in a price adjustment reflecting the rights entitlement value. The significant premium of Rs. 110 over face value of Rs. 10 suggests confidence in the company's valuation.

**Liquidity Impact**: Rights issues generally increase the total outstanding shares by up to 50% (if fully subscribed), potentially improving market liquidity post-issue.

**Trading Impact**: Trading members must ensure proper handling of ex-rights transactions to avoid settlement issues. The 1:2 ratio and high premium require careful calculation of entitlements.
