  Shares
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a new ISIN number INE375C01022 for SAMPRE NUTRITIONS LTD (Scrip Code: 530617) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs.10/- to Rs.5/-. The new ISIN will be effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of November 14, 2025. This notice is in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251107-64 dated November 07, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company Name: SAMPRE NUTRITIONS LTD
- Scrip Code: 530617
- New ISIN Number: INE375C01022
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Old Face Value: Rs.10/- per share
- New Face Value: Rs.5/- per share
- Reference: DR-756/2025-2026
- Prior Notice Reference: Exchange Notice No. 20251107-64 dated November 07, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The ISIN number change is a standard procedure following the sub-division of equity shares. The old ISIN will be replaced with INE375C01022 for all trades executed on or after the ex-date. Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN and revised face value.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number INE375C01022
- All trading and settlement systems must recognize the new face value of Rs.5/- per share
- Members should ensure proper mapping of the new ISIN in their databases before the ex-date
- Shareholders' records must be updated to reflect the sub-divided shares

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 12, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: November 14, 2025 (effective date for new ISIN)
- **Prior Notice Date**: November 07, 2025 (Exchange Notice No. 20251107-64)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares while reducing the price per share proportionately, potentially improving liquidity and making shares more accessible to retail investors. The face value reduction from Rs.10/- to Rs.5/- represents a 1:2 sub-division.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members, custodians, and depositories must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN and face value. Existing shareholders will see their holdings doubled with the price per share halved accordingly. No action is required from shareholders as the adjustment is automatic.

**Administrative Impact**: This is a routine corporate action with minimal disruption expected, provided all market participants update their systems before the ex-date.
