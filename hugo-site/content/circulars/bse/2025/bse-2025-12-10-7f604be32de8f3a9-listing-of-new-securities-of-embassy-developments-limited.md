## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification with limited market impact. The preferential issue represents capital raising through warrant conversion to non-promoter investors. All shares are subject to lock-in until June 10, 2026, which means they cannot be traded until that date despite being listed. The dilution impact on existing shareholders is moderate given the total issuance of approximately 8.96 million shares. Trading members should be aware of the lock-in restrictions when processing orders.
