title: Changes to the BSE Indices - Allcargo Gati Ltd. Amalgamation
---

## Summary

BSE announces index changes effective November 12, 2025, due to the amalgamation of Allcargo Gati Ltd. (ticker: 532345) into Allcargo Logistics Ltd. (ticker: 532749). Allcargo Gati Ltd. will be removed from multiple BSE indices as part of the Scheme of Arrangement.

## Key Points

- Allcargo Gati Ltd. (532345) is amalgamating into Allcargo Logistics Ltd. (532749)
- No new stocks will be added to the affected indices
- Changes apply to four BSE indices: BSE SMALLCAP, BSE ALLCAP, BSE SERVICES, and BSE MIDSMALLCAP
- Corporate action has been included in the end-of-day corporate action file (*.SDE)
- Queries should be directed to bseindex@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an administrative index reconstitution following a corporate amalgamation scheme.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements for market participants. Index tracking funds and passive investment strategies will need to adjust their portfolios to reflect the index composition changes.

## Important Dates

- **November 7, 2025**: Circular notice date
- **November 12, 2025**: Effective date for index changes and amalgamation

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. The removal of Allcargo Gati Ltd. from four BSE indices will require index-tracking funds to rebalance portfolios. Since no replacement stock is being added, the weight distribution among remaining constituents will be adjusted proportionally.

**Affected Indices**:
- BSE SMALLCAP
- BSE ALLCAP  
- BSE SERVICES
- BSE MIDSMALLCAP

**Operational Impact**: Passive fund managers and algorithmic trading systems tracking these indices must implement the changes on the effective date. The amalgamation consolidates two logistics entities, potentially creating a stronger combined entity under Allcargo Logistics Ltd.
