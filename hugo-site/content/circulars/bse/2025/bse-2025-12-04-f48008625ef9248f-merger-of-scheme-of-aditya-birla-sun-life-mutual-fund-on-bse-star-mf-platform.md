## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a scheme consolidation activity under existing mutual fund regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- BSE StAR MF Platform participants should update their systems to reflect the scheme merger
- Investors in the transferor schemes will be automatically moved to the corresponding transferee schemes
- ISIN codes will change for all affected investors
- Fund houses and distributors should ensure proper communication to affected unitholders

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** December 4, 2025
- Specific merger effective date not mentioned in the circular content provided

## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Investors:** Existing unitholders of the CRISIL-IBX AAA NBFC-HFC Index Dec 2025 Fund will see their investments transferred to the CRISIL-IBX Financial Services 9-12 Months Debt Index Fund. This represents a shift from a fund focused on AAA-rated NBFC-HFC debt maturing in December 2025 to a broader financial services sector debt index fund with 9-12 month maturity profile.

**Market Impact:** Minimal direct market impact as this is an internal scheme reorganization. The merger consolidates similar debt index fund offerings under the Aditya Birla Sun Life umbrella.

**Operational Impact:** BSE StAR MF Platform users and intermediaries need to update ISIN mappings and ensure seamless transition for affected investors.
