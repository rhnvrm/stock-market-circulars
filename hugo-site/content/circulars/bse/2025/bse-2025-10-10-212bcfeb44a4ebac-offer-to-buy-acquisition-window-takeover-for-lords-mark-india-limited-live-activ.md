## Impact Assessment

This is a standard acquisition window (takeover) procedure for a small-cap stock. The offer size is limited to 2.6 lakh shares at Rs. 30 per share, representing a relatively small transaction value. Impact is confined to existing shareholders of Lords Mark India Limited who may choose to participate in the offer. Trading members and custodians need to ensure operational readiness for the OTB process during the offer period. No broader market impact is anticipated.
