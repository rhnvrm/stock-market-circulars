## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective December 30, 2025. The circular identifies 12 securities being newly shortlisted for ST-ASM, 1 security moving to a higher stage within the framework, and 7 securities moving out of the framework. ST-ASM is applied to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or other concerns requiring enhanced surveillance.

## Key Points

- 12 securities newly shortlisted for Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework
- Includes A2Z Infra Engineering Ltd, Baroda Extrusion Ltd, K&R Rail Engineering Ltd, KNR Constructions Ltd, Omaxe Ltd, Rail Vikas Nigam Limited, and others
- Spice Islands Industries Ltd continues in ST-ASM but moves to higher stage
- 7 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework including Amines & Plasticizers Ltd, Soma Papers & Industries Ltd
- Some securities moving out due to inclusion in other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM, GSM)
- Framework includes SME scrips and T+0 scrips marked with special symbols

## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term ASM framework imposes additional surveillance measures on securities showing unusual price or volume movements. Securities in this framework face:
- Enhanced monitoring of trading activity
- Potential restrictions on intraday trading
- Graduated stages (Stage I, II, etc.) with increasing surveillance intensity
- Movement between stages based on continued price behavior

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of ST-ASM applicability for affected securities
- Trading members should inform clients about securities under enhanced surveillance
- Additional margin requirements and trading restrictions may apply to ST-ASM securities
- Investors should exercise caution when trading in ST-ASM listed securities

## Important Dates

- **December 30, 2025**: Effective date for all ST-ASM framework changes
- Securities will be subject to new surveillance measures from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The inclusion of 12 securities in ST-ASM framework will result in enhanced surveillance and potentially reduced liquidity for these stocks. Traders may face higher margins and restrictions on intraday positions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should expect increased volatility monitoring and potential trading limitations. The measure is designed to protect investors from excessive speculation and abnormal price movements.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members must update their systems to reflect the new surveillance classifications and ensure compliance with applicable margin and trading restrictions for affected securities.
