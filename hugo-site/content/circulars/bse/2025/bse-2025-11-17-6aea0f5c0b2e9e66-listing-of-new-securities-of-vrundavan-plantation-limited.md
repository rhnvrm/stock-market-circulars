## Impact Assessment

This listing represents a routine corporate action with limited market-wide impact. The addition of 856,872 shares increases the tradable float of Vrundavan Plantation Limited, though a significant portion (100% of issued shares) is subject to lock-in periods ranging from approximately 6 months to 18 months from the listing date. The preferential allotment to promoters and non-promoters via warrant conversion is a standard capital-raising mechanism. Trading members should be aware of the lock-in restrictions when processing orders for this scrip.
