The quantities vary significantly from single shares to 300,000 shares (Murae Organi).

- Total securities listed: 95 individual entries
- Largest quantity: 300,000 shares of Murae Organi (scrip code 542724)

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members with short delivery positions in the listed securities must participate in the demat auction
- Members must ensure availability of securities for delivery settlement
- Participants should settle their obligations as per BSE auction procedures
- Non-delivery may result in penalties and further auction proceedings

## Important Dates

- Auction Settlement: Settlement No. 756

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects multiple securities but is part of routine settlement operations.

**Operational Impact:** Direct impact on brokers and trading members who have failed to deliver securities in previous settlements. These participants must now procure shares through the auction mechanism at potentially unfavorable prices.

**Investor Impact:** Limited direct impact on retail investors. However, companies with larger auction quantities (Murae Organi, Harshil Agro, Vodafone Idea, Khoobsurat) may experience temporary price volatility during auction proceedings.

**Notable Observations:**
- Presence of major stocks like Infosys (2 shares), Tata Motors (25 shares), and Bank of Maharashtra (1,000 shares) indicates settlement issues even in liquid securities
- Murae Organi's 300,000 share quantity stands out as exceptionally large, suggesting significant delivery failure
- Wide variety of sectors represented: banking, IT, pharma, manufacturing, real estate, telecom
