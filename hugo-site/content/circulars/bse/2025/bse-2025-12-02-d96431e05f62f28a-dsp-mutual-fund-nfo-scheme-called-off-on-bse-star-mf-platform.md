title: DSP Mutual Fund NFO Scheme Called Off on BSE StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

DSP Mutual Fund has called off the DSP Fixed Maturity Plan (FMP) Series 277-789 Days NFO at the AMC level. All valid subscription orders reported to RTA with funds during the NFO period (November 27, 2025 to December 01, 2025) will be rejected with the remark "NFO Called Off". Refunds for rejected purchase orders will be released to clients' registered bank accounts by the Exchange.

## Key Points

- DSP Fixed Maturity Plan (FMP) Series 277-789 Days NFO has been called off by DSP Mutual Fund
- The NFO was originally launched on BSE StAR MF Platform per Notice No. 20251126-66 dated November 26, 2025
- All subscription orders placed during the NFO period will be rejected
- Rejection status will show "NFO Called Off" in order status reports
- Refunds will be processed automatically by the Exchange

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational update regarding the cancellation of a specific mutual fund NFO scheme.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members should inform clients who subscribed to this NFO about the cancellation
- No action required from members as refunds will be processed automatically
- Monitor refund processing to client accounts

## Important Dates

- **NFO Period**: November 27, 2025 to December 01, 2025 (subscription period)
- **Notice Date**: December 02, 2025
- **Refund Processing**: To be released by Exchange to registered bank accounts

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Investors who subscribed to the DSP FMP Series 277-789 Days during the NFO period will receive full refunds to their registered bank accounts. No loss of capital, though investors may experience opportunity cost if they were expecting returns from this fixed maturity plan.

**Market Impact**: Limited broader market impact as this affects only a single NFO scheme. The cancellation appears to be an AMC-level decision, possibly due to market conditions, subscription levels, or internal strategy changes.

**Operational Impact**: BSE StAR MF Platform and RTAs will process rejection of all valid orders and handle refund disbursements. Members should be prepared to handle client queries regarding the cancellation and refund timeline.
