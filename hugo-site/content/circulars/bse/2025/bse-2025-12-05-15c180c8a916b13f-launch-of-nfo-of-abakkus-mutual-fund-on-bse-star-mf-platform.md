## Important Dates

- **Tentative Allotment Date**: December 12, 2025 (for all 10 plan variants)

## Impact Assessment

This NFO launch has minimal market-wide impact. It provides investors with a new liquid fund investment option through ABAKKUS MUTUAL FUND. The availability of multiple plan variants (Direct/Regular, Growth/IDCW with different frequencies) offers flexibility for different investor preferences. The impact is primarily relevant to:

- Retail and institutional investors seeking liquid fund investment opportunities
- Mutual fund distributors and advisors on the BSE StAR MF Platform
- The ABAKKUS MUTUAL FUND as they expand their product offerings

Liquid funds typically invest in short-term money market instruments and are used for parking surplus funds with relatively lower risk and high liquidity.
