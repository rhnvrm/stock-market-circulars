title: High Encumbrance Surveillance Measure - Addition of Bedmutha Industries
---

## Summary

BSE has added Bedmutha Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 533270, ISIN: INE844K01012) to the surveillance measure for companies with high promoter and non-promoter share encumbrance as per Regulation 28(3) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations 2011. The measure takes effect from November 26, 2025. No securities are being removed from this framework. The consolidated list now contains 7 securities under this surveillance measure.

## Key Points

- One security added to high encumbrance surveillance framework effective November 26, 2025
- Bedmutha Industries Ltd is the only addition in this update
- No securities are exiting the framework in this circular
- Consolidated list maintains 7 securities under surveillance
- Framework monitors companies with high share pledge levels by both promoters and non-promoters

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements surveillance measures under SEBI (SAST) Regulations 2011, specifically Regulation 28(3) which deals with encumbrance disclosures. The measure applies to companies where significant portions of shares (both promoter and non-promoter holdings) are pledged or encumbered, indicating potential financial stress or elevated risk.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance on Bedmutha Industries Ltd
- Securities under this framework face additional monitoring and may have specific trading restrictions
- Market participants should exercise heightened caution when trading in listed securities
- Companies must comply with encumbrance disclosure requirements under SEBI SAST Regulations

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 26, 2025 - Bedmutha Industries Ltd enters high encumbrance surveillance framework

## Impact Assessment

The addition of Bedmutha Industries to this framework signals regulatory concern about share pledge levels. The consolidated list of 7 securities represents companies requiring enhanced monitoring due to elevated encumbrance ratios. This framework helps protect investors by flagging securities where promoter and non-promoter holdings show high pledge levels, which could indicate financial leverage concerns or potential ownership volatility. Other securities on the consolidated list include B.L. Kashyap and Sons, Brahmaputra Infrastructure, India Finsec, India Nivesh, NR Agarwal Industries, and Sudal Industries.
