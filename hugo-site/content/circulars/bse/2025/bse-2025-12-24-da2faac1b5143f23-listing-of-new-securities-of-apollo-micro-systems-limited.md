## Impact Assessment

The listing represents a minor addition to Apollo Micro Systems Limited's equity capital with 35,088 shares (approximately 0.03-0.05% of typical paid-up capital for such companies). The preferential allotment to non-promoters via warrant conversion is a routine corporate action. The lock-in period until July 1, 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure. Overall market impact is minimal given the small share count and lock-in restrictions. This is a standard compliance listing notification for trading members.
