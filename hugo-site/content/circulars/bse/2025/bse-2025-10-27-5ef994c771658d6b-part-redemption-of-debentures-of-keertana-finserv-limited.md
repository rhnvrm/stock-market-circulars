This circular has moderate impact limited to holders of KEERTANA FINSERV LIMITED debentures. The part redemption will return capital to debenture holders while reducing the outstanding principal amount.

The 11.40% coupon rate debentures will continue trading at the reduced face value, affecting position sizing and risk calculations for debt market participants. No broader market impact expected as this is a routine corporate action for a private placement debt security.
