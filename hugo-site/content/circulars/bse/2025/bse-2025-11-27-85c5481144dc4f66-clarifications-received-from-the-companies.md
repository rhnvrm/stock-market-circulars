All three companies—Tata Investment Corporation Limited (Scrip Code: 501301), Eraaya Lifespaces Limited (Scrip Code: 531035), and Igarashi Motors India Limited (Stock Code: 517380)—confirmed that they have no pending material price-sensitive information or announcements under Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations & Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 that could explain the unusual trading activity. The companies stated that the volume increases are market-driven.
