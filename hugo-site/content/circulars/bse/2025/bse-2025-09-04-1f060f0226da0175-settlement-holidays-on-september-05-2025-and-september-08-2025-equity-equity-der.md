## Summary

BSE has revised settlement schedules for all major trading segments due to the Maharashtra government declaring September 08, 2025 as a public holiday and cancelling the previously declared holiday on September 05, 2025. All settlements originally scheduled for September 08, 2025 have been moved to September 09, 2025.

## Key Points

- September 08, 2025 declared as public holiday by Maharashtra government
- September 05, 2025 holiday has been cancelled
- Settlement dates revised for equity, equity derivatives, currency derivatives, and commodity derivatives
- Currency derivatives trading on September 08, 2025 stands cancelled

## Regulatory Changes

Based on RBI press release 2025-2026/1042 dated September 04, 2025, the Government of Maharashtra has made changes to public holidays under Section 25 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.

## Important Dates

**Revised Settlement Schedule:**

- **Equity, Equity Derivatives & Commodity Derivatives:**
  - Trade Date: September 04, 2025 → Settlement: September 09, 2025 (revised from September 08)
  - Trade Date: September 05, 2025 → Settlement: September 09, 2025 (revised from September 08)

- **Currency Derivatives:**
  - Trade Date: September 04, 2025 → Settlement: September 09, 2025 (revised from September 08)
  - Trade Date: September 05, 2025 → Settlement: September 09, 2025 (new settlement date)
  - September 08, 2025: Trading holiday - no settlement applicable

## Impact Assessment

Market participants need to adjust their settlement expectations and cash flow planning accordingly. Currency derivatives segment is particularly impacted with September 08, 2025 becoming a complete trading holiday.
