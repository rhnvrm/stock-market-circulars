---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for five scrips under surveillance measures effective November 28, 2025. The changes include tightening price bands to ranges between 2% and 10%, reflecting enhanced monitoring of these securities.

## Key Points

- Five scrips affected with revised price bands effective November 28, 2025

- Members can seek clarification at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

This circular represents surveillance action by BSE to modify price band restrictions from their existing levels. Tighter price bands limit the maximum price movement allowed in a single trading session, reducing volatility and speculative trading in these scrips.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands from November 28, 2025
- All trades in affected scrips must adhere to new percentage limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: November 27, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to five specific scrips, primarily affecting traders and investors in these securities. The tightened price bands will restrict intraday price movements and reduce volatility.

**Trading Impact**: Traders must adjust strategies to accommodate narrower price bands. Omnitex Industries faces the most restrictive 2% band, significantly limiting price discovery and liquidity.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may experience reduced liquidity and difficulty exiting positions quickly. The surveillance measures suggest potential concerns regarding price volatility or unusual trading patterns in these securities.
