- Trading members are required to note the record date and ex-rights date for proper settlement
- Shareholders holding shares as of the record date will be entitled to participate in the rights issue

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: December 10, 2025
- **Record Date**: December 15, 2025
- **Ex-Rights Date**: December 15, 2025
- **Settlement Number**: DR-777/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will have the opportunity to subscribe to 2 additional shares for every 1 share held, potentially doubling their shareholding at par value. Non-participation will result in dilution of their ownership stake.

**Market Impact**: The ex-rights trading from December 15, 2025 will result in price adjustment to reflect the rights entitlement. The 2:1 ratio represents significant equity expansion.

**Liquidity Impact**: Increased share capital will potentially improve liquidity in the stock post-rights issue, though immediate trading will reflect the ex-rights adjustment.

**Financial Impact**: The issue at par value (Re.1/-) suggests the company is raising capital for business operations, with full payment due on application.
