## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) is a graded surveillance mechanism applied to securities showing abnormal price movements or other concerns. Securities under ESM face additional trading restrictions and monitoring requirements. The framework operates in multiple stages with progressively stricter measures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of securities under ESM and their respective stages
- Enhanced due diligence required when trading ESM securities
- Brokers should inform clients about ESM status of securities
- Additional margin requirements and trading restrictions apply to ESM securities
- Securities may be subject to trade-for-trade settlement, additional surveillance deposit, or price bands depending on ESM stage

## Important Dates

- **November 6, 2025**: Effective date for ESM framework updates
  - Shree Salasar Investments Ltd enters ESM
  - Three securities move to higher ESM stages

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects liquidity and trading conditions for the identified securities. Securities under ESM typically experience reduced trading volumes due to additional restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will face enhanced surveillance measures including potential additional margins, trade-for-trade settlement, and closer monitoring of trading activity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems and risk management frameworks to account for the changed ESM status of these securities and ensure compliance with applicable restrictions.
