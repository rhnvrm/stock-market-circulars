## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it only affects subscription, redemption, and switch transactions for specific international mutual fund schemes on the BSE StAR MF platform. Investors planning to transact in these schemes should be aware of the non-business days and plan accordingly. The closure aligns with holiday schedules in underlying international markets (US and Japan). Domestic equity trading and other mutual fund schemes remain unaffected.
