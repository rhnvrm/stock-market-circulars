## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 4 additional shares for every 1 share held as of the record date, resulting in a 5x increase in shareholding (including the original share after sub-division). This significantly enhances liquidity and makes the stock more accessible to retail investors.

**Market Impact**: The combined corporate action will increase the total outstanding shares to over 91.66 crore shares. While individual share price will proportionately adjust, improved liquidity may attract more trading interest. The sub-division makes the stock more affordable for small investors.

**Trading Impact**: No trading disruption expected as the company is using Auto Corporate Action mechanism with both depositories, ensuring seamless credit of bonus shares. Trading in the new shares will commence from November 4, 2025.

**Operational Impact**: Smooth execution depends on proper coordination between the company, BSE, and both depositories (CDSL and NSDL) to ensure timely credit of bonus shares to investor accounts.
