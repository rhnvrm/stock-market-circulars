## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction involves 77 scrips indicating delivery defaults across multiple securities. While this is a routine settlement mechanism, the presence of high-volume auctions (e.g., 146,000 shares of Enbee Trade, 29,300 shares of Indiabulls) may create temporary price volatility in affected securities.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Brokers and clearing members with short positions must arrange funds and participate in auctions, impacting their operational workflow and liquidity requirements.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Investors in affected scrips may experience temporary price movements during auction periods. Those with delivery obligations face potential financial impact due to auction pricing mechanisms.
