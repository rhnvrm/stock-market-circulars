**Market Impact:** Medium - Provides liquidity and investment opportunity in government securities market with combined issue size of Rs. 30,000 crores. The re-issue nature indicates continued government borrowing through existing securities.

**Investor Impact:** Positive for retail and institutional investors seeking safe government-backed fixed-income instruments with attractive yields (6.01% for 5-year and 7.09% for 49-year tenures).

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to coordinate bid submissions through BSE's iBBS platform within specified timelines. The 24-hour bid collection window provides flexibility, but members must ensure timely submission before the 8:00 AM deadline on auction day.
