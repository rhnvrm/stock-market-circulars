## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market impact as it represents a routine short-term debt instrument issuance. The commercial paper is limited to institutional and qualified investors in the debt market segment. With a strong ICRA A1+ rating and ICICI Bank as the paying agent, the instrument carries low credit risk. The 91-day tenure and private placement nature limit its broader market significance. Trading members dealing in debt securities should note the listing for their clients interested in high-rated short-term debt instruments.
