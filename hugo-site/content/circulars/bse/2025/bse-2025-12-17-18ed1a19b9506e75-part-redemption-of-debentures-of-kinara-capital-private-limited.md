## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action notification regarding part redemption of debentures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new reduced face value of Rs. 95,709.30 per debenture
- All trading in these debentures must be conducted at the revised face value from the effective date
- Trading members are required to take note of this change and ensure compliance

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 17, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 18, 2025 - Debentures will trade with reduced face value from this date

## Impact Assessment

This part redemption results in a reduced face value for the debentures, indicating that KINARA CAPITAL has paid back a portion of the principal amount to debenture holders. Trading members dealing in these debt instruments must update their trading systems to reflect the new face value. The impact is limited to holders and traders of this specific debenture series. The substantial face value suggests these are privately placed debentures with likely limited liquidity in the secondary market.
