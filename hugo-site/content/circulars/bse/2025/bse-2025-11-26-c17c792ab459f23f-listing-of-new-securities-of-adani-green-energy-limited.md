## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of 2.45 crore shares represents a significant addition to Adani Green Energy's equity base through preferential allotment to promoters. The lock-in period until May 29, 2027 ensures these shares will not immediately impact market liquidity.

**Shareholding Impact**: This preferential issue to promoters will increase promoter shareholding in the company, potentially strengthening their control. The shares rank pari-passu with existing equity.

**Trading Impact**: Minimal immediate trading impact expected due to complete lock-in of all newly listed shares until May 2027. The issue price of Rs. 1480.75 provides a reference point for valuation.

**Investor Consideration**: Investors should note the dilution in existing shareholding and the promoter-focused nature of this issuance through warrant conversion.
