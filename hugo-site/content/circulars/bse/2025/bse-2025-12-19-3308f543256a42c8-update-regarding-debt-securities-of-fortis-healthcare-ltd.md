## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact:**
The conversion from secured to unsecured NCDs represents a material change in the risk profile of these debt instruments. Secured NCDs are backed by collateral, providing investors with recourse to specific assets in case of default. Unsecured NCDs do not have such backing, making them higher risk. This change may affect:
- Credit ratings of the instruments
- Market valuation and pricing
- Investor appetite and liquidity
- Risk assessment for portfolio management

**Market Operations:**
- ISIN changes require system updates across trading platforms, depositories, and custodian systems
- Trading members must ensure proper mapping of old to new ISINs
- Potential impact on existing positions and holdings records

**Company Context:**
Fortis Healthcare Ltd is a major healthcare services provider. The change in security status may reflect corporate restructuring, asset reallocation, or changes in the company's capital structure strategy.
