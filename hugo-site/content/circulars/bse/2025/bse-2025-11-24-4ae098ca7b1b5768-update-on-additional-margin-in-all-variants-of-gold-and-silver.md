title: Update on Additional Margin in All Variants of Gold and Silver
---

## Summary

ICCL continues to levy additional margins on gold and silver commodity derivative contracts during the tender period as part of periodic risk management measures. Silver variants will have 4.5% additional margin while gold variants will have 1% additional margin.

## Key Points

- Additional margin continuation in accordance with ICCL circular no. 20251029-28 dated 29 October 2025
- Measure implemented to mitigate systemic risk and ensure adequacy of risk management
- Applies to all members and participants trading in specified gold and silver contracts
- Margins apply specifically during the tender period of respective contracts

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular provides an update continuing previously announced margin requirements during the tender period for specified contracts.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members and participants must maintain additional margins as specified for the listed contracts
- Additional margin of 4.5% required on SILVERKG, SILVERM (28-Nov-25 expiry) and SILVER (05-Dec-25 expiry)
- Additional margin of 1% required on GOLD and GOLDM (05-Dec-25 expiry)
- Margins to be maintained throughout the tender period

## Important Dates

- **28 November 2025**: Expiry date for SILVERKG and SILVERM contracts (4.5% additional margin during tender period)
- **05 December 2025**: Expiry date for SILVER, GOLD, and GOLDM contracts (4.5% for silver, 1% for gold during tender period)
- **Circular Date**: 24 November 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Additional margins significantly increase capital requirements for traders holding positions in gold and silver contracts during tender period. The 4.5% margin on silver is particularly substantial and may affect trading volumes and liquidity.

**Operational Impact**: High - Members must ensure adequate capital allocation and margin coverage for positions in these precious metal contracts. Risk management systems must account for these additional margin requirements.

**Trader Impact**: Traders with open positions in the specified contracts will face increased margin obligations, potentially requiring additional funding or position adjustments before and during the tender period.
