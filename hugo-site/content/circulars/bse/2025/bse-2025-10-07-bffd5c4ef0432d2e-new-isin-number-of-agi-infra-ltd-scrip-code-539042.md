BSE has assigned a new ISIN number INE976R01033 to AGI Infra Ltd (Scrip Code: 539042) following the sub-division of equity shares from Rs. 5/- per share to Re. 1/- per share. The new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date of October 10, 2025. This notice continues from the previous exchange notice dated September 23, 2025.

- Sub-division ratio: Rs. 5/- per share to Re. 1/- per share
- Ex-date for new ISIN: October 10, 2025
- Debit reference: DR-733/2025-2026
- Continuation of notice dated September 23, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action involving share sub-division and consequent ISIN reassignment as per existing BSE procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN INE976R01033 for all trades in AGI Infra Ltd equity shares from October 10, 2025 onwards
- All trading systems must be updated to reflect the new share denomination of Re. 1/- per share
- Existing shareholders will receive sub-divided shares in their demat accounts as per the sub-division ratio

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 7, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: October 10, 2025 (new ISIN becomes effective)
- **Previous Notice Reference**: September 23, 2025 (Notice No. 20250923-67)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division increases the number of outstanding shares by 5x while proportionally reducing the price per share. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors. Trading members must ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN to avoid trade failures. Shareholders' overall investment value remains unchanged, but the number of shares held will increase proportionally.
