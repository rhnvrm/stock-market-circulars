- Trading members must ensure transactions in PULSAR INTERNATIONAL LIMITED shares are conducted on ex-rights basis from the specified date
- All trades from December 22, 2025 onwards must reflect ex-rights status
- Trading members are required to take note of the record date and ex-rights date for client positions

## Important Dates

- **Record Date:** December 22, 2025
- **Ex-Rights Date:** December 22, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-782/2025-2026)
- **Circular Date:** December 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact:** Existing shareholders will have the opportunity to subscribe to 5 new shares for every 1 share held, representing significant potential dilution if rights are not exercised. The issue being at par (Re.1/-) makes it neutral from a premium/discount perspective.

**Trading Impact:** Shares will trade ex-rights from December 22, 2025, which will result in a theoretical price adjustment to reflect the rights entitlement separation. Investors purchasing shares on or after this date will not be entitled to participate in the rights issue.

**Market Liquidity:** The 5:1 ratio represents a substantial increase in potential share capital (500% if fully subscribed), which could significantly impact the stock's liquidity and price dynamics post-issue.
