**Investor Impact**: Medium - Investors holding these securities on the respective record dates will receive dividends, interest payments, or distributions. Those planning to purchase must consider ex-date timing for entitlement.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Standard corporate action processing required by depositories, registrars, and brokers for dividend crediting and debt instrument redemptions.
