- Notice issued by Hardik Bhuta, Assistant Vice President

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is an operational update regarding debt securities in accordance with existing framework for call money receipts on debentures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the new ISIN (INE414G07JV6) for trading and settlement purposes
- Debenture holders should update their records with the new ISIN and revised paid-up value
- All market participants must use the new parameters for transactions from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The change affects specific debt securities of Muthoot Finance Limited. The significant increase in paid-up value per debenture (from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,00,000) will impact lot sizes and minimum investment requirements for traders.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and debenture holders must update their systems with the new ISIN to ensure proper settlement.
