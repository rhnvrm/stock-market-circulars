## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notice with minimal market impact. The addition of DSP MSCI India ETF provides investors with another passive investment vehicle tracking the MSCI India Index. The presence of eleven market makers should ensure adequate liquidity for the ETF. The relatively small initial allotment of 2.13 million units suggests this is an initial listing phase. Impact is limited to investors seeking exposure to MSCI India Index through ETF route and does not affect broader market operations or existing listed securities.
