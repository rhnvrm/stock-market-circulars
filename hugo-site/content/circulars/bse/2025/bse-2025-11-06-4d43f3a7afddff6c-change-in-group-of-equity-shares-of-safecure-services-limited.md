This change follows the initial listing phase and allows for more flexible trading arrangements.

## Key Points

- Contact person: Mr. Anurag Jain, Tel: 022-2272 8822

## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for SAFECURE SERVICES LIMITED will transition from:
- **From**: Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) - typically used for newly listed SME IPO stocks with settlement restrictions
- **To**: Rolling segment (M Group) - allows normal trading with standard settlement cycles

This represents a graduation from the more restrictive trading framework applied to new SME listings.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the group change
- Members should note the effective date of November 20, 2025 for the transition
- Trading members requiring clarification should contact Mr. Anurag Jain at BSE

- **November 06, 2025**: Current circular issued
- **November 20, 2025**: Effective date for transfer to Rolling segment (M Group)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The move to Rolling segment enhances liquidity and trading flexibility for SAFECURE SERVICES LIMITED shares, potentially increasing trading volumes and investor participation.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update internal systems and processes to accommodate the group change. The transition from Trade for Trade to Rolling settlement indicates the stock has completed its initial stabilization period post-IPO.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for investors as Rolling segment typically offers better liquidity, intraday trading opportunities, and standard settlement mechanisms compared to the restrictive Trade for Trade segment.
