**Operational Impact:** SLB participants must manage position closures and may need to arrange alternative financing or hedging arrangements during the shut periods. Participants with open positions must plan for timely foreclosure to avoid penalties or forced closure.

**Investor Impact:** Investors utilizing SLB for short selling or securities borrowing strategies will need to close positions or postpone new transactions during the specified periods. This may temporarily affect trading strategies and liquidity availability for these securities in the SLB segment.
