## Key Points

## Securities Details

| Security Code | ISIN | Security Name | Moving to Stage |
|--------------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 511688 | INE963B01019 | Mathew Easow Research Securities Ltd | III |
| 523712 | INE745F01011 | JMG Corporation Ltd | III |

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework imposes progressive restrictions as securities move through different stages. Higher stages typically involve:
- Reduced price bands
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Trade-for-trade settlement with 100% upfront margin
- Increased scrutiny of trading patterns

## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers must inform clients about the surveillance status of these securities
- Trading members must ensure compliance with additional margin requirements for GSM securities
- Investors should be aware of the increased surveillance and associated trading restrictions
- Companies under GSM must comply with enhanced disclosure norms

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: December 11, 2025
- Effective implementation as per BSE surveillance framework guidelines

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Movement to higher GSM stages significantly restricts trading activity in these securities. Stage III and IV designations indicate serious concerns about volatility, price manipulation, or corporate governance issues. Investors will face:
- Reduced liquidity due to trade-for-trade settlement
- Higher margin requirements
- Limited participation from institutional investors
- Potential difficulty in executing large orders

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders may experience difficulty exiting positions due to reduced liquidity. New investors face higher entry barriers and increased risk. The surveillance designation serves as a strong caution signal about potential risks associated with these securities.
