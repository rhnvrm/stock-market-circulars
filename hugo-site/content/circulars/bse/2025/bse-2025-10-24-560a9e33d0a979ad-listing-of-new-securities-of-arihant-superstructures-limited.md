## Impact Assessment

This is a company-specific listing event with minimal market-wide impact. The preferential allotment increases the equity base of Arihant Superstructures Limited by 20,90,000 shares. The complete lock-in period until April 29, 2026 means these shares will not be available for trading for approximately six months from the listing date, which may limit liquidity impact in the near term. The allotment to Non-Promoters through warrant conversion represents fundraising activity by the company.
