## Key Points

- Price bands vary from 2% to 20% based on individual security characteristics
- Changes are implemented by BSE Surveillance department
- Trading members have been notified through Notice No 20251203-41

## Affected Securities

| Scrip Code | Company Name | New Price Band |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| 524602 | Bandaram Pharma Packtech Ltd | 5% |
| 501831 | Coastal Corporation Ltd | 5% |
| 524614 | IEL Ltd | 2% |
| 751063 | Indowind Energy Ltd | 20% |
| 543256 | Rita Finance and Leasing Ltd | 5% |
| 544582 | Shlokka Dyes Ltd | 10% |
| 517166 | SPEL Semiconductor Ltd | 2% |

## Regulatory Changes

The price bands have been revised from their existing levels as a surveillance measure. Price bands restrict the maximum price movement (both upward and downward) that a security can experience during a trading session, helping to control excessive volatility.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must apply the revised price bands to the affected securities from December 4, 2025
- All trading systems must be updated to reflect the new price band percentages
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 3, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 4, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The revised price bands will impact trading in these seven securities by limiting intraday price movements. Securities with tighter bands (2%) will have more restricted price movements, potentially affecting liquidity and trading strategies. Indowind Energy Ltd with a 20% band will have the most trading flexibility among the affected securities. These changes are part of BSE's surveillance measures to manage market volatility and protect investor interests.
