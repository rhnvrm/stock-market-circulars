## Impact Assessment

**Shareholding Impact**: The allotment of 346.78 crore shares represents significant equity dilution. The exact dilution percentage depends on pre-allotment share capital, but the scale suggests substantial expansion of equity base.

**Liquidity Impact**: While trading begins November 17, 2025, entire allotment is locked-in, limiting immediate float. Only 26% of shares become tradeable by May 2026, with remaining 74% locked until May 2027.

**Market Sentiment**: Preferential allotment to both Promoter and Non-Promoter categories at Rs. 5.62/- indicates fundraising activity. Long lock-in periods suggest strategic investor participation and promoter commitment.

**Trading Considerations**: Market participants should monitor price movements given the significant increase in total share count and phased unlock of shares over 2-year period.
