- **Effective Date**: October 31, 2025 (or next business day if non-business day)
- **Consent/Exit Period**: September 30, 2025 to October 29, 2025 (both days inclusive)

## Compliance Requirements

- Unit holders who do not respond will be deemed to have consented to the merger
- Tax treatment: Per Section 47(xviii) of Income Tax Act 1961, allotment of units in Transferee Scheme will not be considered redemption and will not result in capital gains/losses for continuing unit holders

## Important Dates

- **October 29, 2025**: Consent/Exit Option Period ends

## Impact Assessment

**Benefits for Unit Holders:**

1. **Credit Quality**: Comparable credit quality with higher exposure to AAA-rated CPSE and bank bonds (~78%) in Transferee Scheme
2. **Liquidity Risk Mitigation**: Superior liquidity due to exposure to more liquid CPSE bonds and government bonds
3. **Reinvestment Risk Mitigation**: Eliminates reinvestment risk as Transferee Scheme is open-ended without fixed maturity date
4. **Active Management**: Benefits from active duration management based on market conditions
5. **Diversification**: Enhanced portfolio diversification across AAA-rated CPSE and bank bonds, maturity buckets, and CPSE segments
6. **Tax Efficiency**: Merger maintains tax efficiency without triggering capital gains for continuing investors
7. **Asset Allocation**: Continued exposure to similar high-quality debt instruments (AAA-rated CPSE bonds, bank bonds, sovereign bonds)

**Impact**: Medium - affects unit holders of specific target maturity fund who must take action during consent period, but provides clear migration path to similar debt scheme with enhanced benefits.
