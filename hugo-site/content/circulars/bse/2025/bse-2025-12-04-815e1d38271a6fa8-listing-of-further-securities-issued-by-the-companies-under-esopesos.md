No regulatory changes announced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the listing of these securities
- Securities are available for trading from the effective date

- **Notice Date**: December 4, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares represents employee compensation and stock-based incentive programs. The volume of shares being listed is relatively small compared to the existing float of these companies. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares can be traded immediately, though the typical holding pattern of employee stock options suggests limited immediate selling pressure. This circular is primarily informational for trading members to update their systems with the new share counts and distinctive numbers.
