## Summary

SEBI has amended the Investment Advisers and Research Analysts regulations to allow the use of liquid mutual funds and overnight mutual funds as alternatives to traditional bank deposits for meeting regulatory deposit requirements. This change provides greater flexibility in compliance while maintaining investor protection.

## Key Points

- Investment Advisers and Research Analysts can now use liquid mutual funds or overnight mutual funds instead of bank deposits
- Deposits must still be marked as lien in favour of IAASB or RAASB
- Amendment regulations were notified on August 6-7, 2025
- Compliance deadline set for September 30, 2025
- BSE Limited (as IAASB/RAASB) must implement necessary systems and procedures

## Regulatory Changes

- SEBI (Investment Advisers) (Amendment) Regulations, 2025 notified on August 7, 2025
- Modified Regulation 8 requirements for both IA and RA regulations
- Expanded acceptable forms of deposits beyond scheduled bank deposits

## Compliance Requirements

  - Units of liquid mutual fund
  - Units of overnight mutual fund
  - Traditional bank deposit with scheduled bank
- All deposits must be marked as lien in favour of appropriate supervisory body
- BSE Limited must establish systems for implementation and notify affected parties

## Important Dates
