No securities were moved to Stage 0, upgraded from Stage 1 to Stage 2, downgraded from Stage 2 to Stage 1, or excluded from the IBC framework during this update.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework for companies undergoing Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The framework has multiple stages:

- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company regarding IBC proceedings
- **Stage 1**: Active surveillance with additional monitoring and potential trading restrictions
- **Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance measures with stricter trading controls

Securities can move between stages based on developments in their insolvency proceedings.

## Compliance Requirements

- Enhanced due diligence required for all securities listed under IBC surveillance framework
- Trading members must comply with additional surveillance measure requirements applicable to Stage 1 securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 12, 2025 - Swan Defence And Heavy Industries Ltd enters Stage 1 ASM
- **Circular Date**: November 11, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Securities under IBC surveillance face restricted trading conditions, reduced liquidity, and heightened investor scrutiny. The addition of Swan Defence to Stage 1 indicates the company is under active insolvency resolution proceedings.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading Swan Defence And Heavy Industries Ltd should be aware of increased risks including potential delisting, trading restrictions, and uncertainty regarding asset recovery.

**Trading Impact**: Stage 1 ASM typically involves trading restrictions such as reduced price bands, trade-for-trade settlement, or other measures to protect investor interests during insolvency proceedings.

**Broader Market Implications**: The consolidated list of 13+ securities under IBC surveillance reflects ongoing corporate stress in certain sectors, requiring vigilance from market participants.
