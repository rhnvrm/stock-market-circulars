  on BSE StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

BSE has informed members that TATA Mutual Fund has deferred the New Fund Offer (NFO) for TITANIUM HYBRID LONG-SHORT FUND, a Specialized Investment Fund (SIF), until further instructions. This deferment follows the initial announcement on November 13, 2025, regarding the introduction of TATA's Specialized Investment Funds on the BSE StAR MF Platform.

## Key Points

- TATA TITANIUM HYBRID LONG-SHORT FUND NFO has been deferred indefinitely
- The fund was classified as a Specialized Investment Fund (SIF)
- The deferment is effective immediately until further communication from TATA Mutual Fund
- This supersedes the earlier notice dated November 13, 2025 (Notice no. 20251113-64)
- The fund was scheduled to be available on BSE StAR MF Platform

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are involved. This is an operational decision by the fund house.

## Compliance Requirements

- BSE members should note the deferment and refrain from accepting subscriptions for this NFO
- Members should await further instructions from TATA Mutual Fund before proceeding with any NFO-related activities for this fund
- Updates to internal systems and investor communications should reflect the deferred status

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** November 14, 2025
- **Original Introduction Notice:** November 13, 2025 (Notice no. 20251113-64)
- **NFO Launch Date:** Deferred until further notice

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this deferment is minimal and limited to the mutual fund segment. Prospective investors interested in the TITANIUM HYBRID LONG-SHORT FUND will need to wait for revised launch timelines. The deferment does not affect existing TATA Mutual Fund schemes or other planned NFOs. This is a routine fund management decision with no broader market implications.
