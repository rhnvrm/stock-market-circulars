## Impact Assessment

This update has a medium impact on holders of Setco Auto Systems Pvt. Ltd debt securities. The maturity extension by two months (from October to December 2025) affects liquidity planning for bondholders. The ISIN changes require operational updates in trading and settlement systems. While the impact is limited to specific scrips and relatively small quantities (975 and 2,150 units), investors and Trading Members must ensure proper tracking of the new ISINs to avoid settlement issues. The notice continues previous communications, suggesting ongoing restructuring or payment term modifications.
