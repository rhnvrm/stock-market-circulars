## Summary

BSE has issued a new ISIN number INE045J01034 for Fineotex Chemical Ltd (Scrip Code: 533333) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs.2/- to Re.1/-. This continues the exchange notice dated October 29, 2025, and will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date of October 31, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN number: INE045J01034
- Company: Fineotex Chemical Ltd (Scrip Code: 533333)
- Corporate action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.2/- to Re.1/-
- New face value: Re.1/- per equity share
- Ex-date for new ISIN: October 31, 2025
- Reference: DR-747/2025-2026
- Continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251029-5 dated October 29, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The ISIN (International Securities Identification Number) for Fineotex Chemical Ltd equity shares will change from the old ISIN to INE045J01034 to reflect the sub-division of shares. This change is mandated to distinguish between the old shares (Rs.2/- face value) and new shares (Re.1/- face value) in the depository system.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN number INE045J01034 for all trades in Fineotex Chemical Ltd equity shares executed on or after October 31, 2025
- Depository participants should update their systems to reflect the new ISIN for post-subdivision shares
- Market participants must ensure proper distinction between pre-subdivision and post-subdivision shares in their records

## Important Dates

- **October 29, 2025**: Initial exchange notice (No. 20251029-5) issued
- **October 30, 2025**: Current circular issued with new ISIN details
- **October 31, 2025**: Ex-date - new ISIN becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

This ISIN change is a standard administrative procedure accompanying the share sub-division corporate action. The impact includes:

- **Shareholders**: Existing shareholders will see their holdings doubled with half the face value per share, maintaining the same total investment value
- **Trading Systems**: All trading and settlement systems must be updated to recognize the new ISIN from the ex-date
- **Liquidity**: Share sub-division typically aims to improve liquidity by reducing per-share price and making shares more accessible to retail investors
- **Demat Accounts**: Investors will see the old ISIN shares converted to new ISIN shares in their demat accounts post ex-date

The change is purely administrative and does not affect the fundamental value or rights attached to the equity shares.
