This is a routine preferential allotment to promoters following warrant conversion. The shares are subject to mandatory lock-in until June 29, 2027, preventing immediate trading by the allottees. The listing increases the company's total paid-up capital but has minimal immediate market impact due to the lock-in provisions. The shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares, maintaining equal rights for all shareholders.
