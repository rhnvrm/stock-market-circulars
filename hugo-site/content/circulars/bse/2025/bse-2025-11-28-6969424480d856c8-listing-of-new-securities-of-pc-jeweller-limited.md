## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment**: August 13, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: December 1, 2025
- **Lock-in Period Expires**: May 31, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - The listing represents approximately 9.78 million shares, which is a standard preferential allotment. The shares being locked-in until May 31, 2026 means they will not be available for immediate trading, minimizing short-term market impact.

**Company Impact**: The warrant conversion provides capital to PC Jeweller Limited and represents equity dilution for existing shareholders. The allotment to non-promoters may marginally reduce promoter holding percentage.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect. The lock-in period provides stability as these shares cannot be sold until mid-2026.
