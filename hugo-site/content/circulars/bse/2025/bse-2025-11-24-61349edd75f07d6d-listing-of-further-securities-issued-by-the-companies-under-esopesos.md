## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The total volume of 732,950 shares being released from lock-in over a 15-day period represents a relatively small supply that is unlikely to materially impact market prices. The staggered release schedule further dilutes any potential selling pressure.

**Operational Impact**: Routine administrative process for depositories and trading members. No special procedures required beyond standard lock-in release protocols.

**Investor Impact**: Beneficial for ESOP/ESOS holders who will gain liquidity on their holdings as lock-in periods expire. Employees can monetize their stock options according to the scheduled dates.
