The company clarified that it is not aware of any formal probe by DGCA, though DGCA has sought certain information which the company is providing. IndiGo experienced operational disruptions over two days due to multiple unforeseen challenges and has implemented calibrated schedule adjustments for 48 hours to normalize operations.

- Calibrated schedule adjustments implemented for 48 hours to restore stability
- Company apologized to customers for inconvenience caused
- No other undisclosed information or events affecting price/volume behavior of securities

## Regulatory Changes
