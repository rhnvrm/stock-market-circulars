## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to privately placed debt securities of a single company. The zero-coupon structure indicates these are discount bonds that will be redeemed at face value upon maturity in 2035. The CARE AA- rating indicates high credit quality with adequate safety for timely servicing of financial obligations. Impact is limited to:

- Debt segment trading members who may facilitate secondary market trading
- Existing and potential investors in Kolte-Patil Developers debt instruments
- The company's ability to raise debt capital through private placements

Total issue size is approximately Rs. 1,099.4 crores (10,994 × Rs. 1,00,000), representing a significant fundraising for the company but with limited broader market implications given the private placement nature.
