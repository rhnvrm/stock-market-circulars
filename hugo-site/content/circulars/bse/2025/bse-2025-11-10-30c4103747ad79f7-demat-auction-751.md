## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - While the auction affects 125 securities, most quantities are relatively small and unlikely to cause significant price disruption. However, larger quantities in stocks like WARDWIZARD (33,500), STANDARD CAP (25,000), and VODAFONE IDEA (22,000) may experience localized price pressure during auction execution.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Affects brokers and clearing members who have outstanding delivery obligations. They must arrange for securities through the auction mechanism, which may involve premium pricing over market rates.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Direct impact primarily on specific members who failed to deliver securities. Indirect impact on other market participants minimal, though temporary price volatility may occur in securities with larger auction quantities during the auction window.
