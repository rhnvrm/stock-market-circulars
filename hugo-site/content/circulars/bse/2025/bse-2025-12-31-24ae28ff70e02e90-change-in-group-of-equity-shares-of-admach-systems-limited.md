## Impact Assessment

This change will improve liquidity and trading flexibility for ADMACH SYSTEMS LIMITED shares. The shift from Trade for Trade to Rolling settlement allows intraday trading, margin trading facilities, and typically results in tighter bid-ask spreads. Investors will benefit from enhanced price discovery and reduced settlement restrictions. The move indicates the stock has met BSE's criteria for graduation from the more restrictive T2T segment.
