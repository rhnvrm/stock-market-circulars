- Lock-in restrictions must be observed as per specified timelines
- Shares can be traded only after respective lock-in periods expire

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: August 6, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: December 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The listing represents a preferential allotment to non-promoters with lock-in provisions that will restrict immediate trading of all shares until mid-2026. The shares constitute an expansion of the company's equity base through warrant conversion.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact on liquidity as all shares are locked-in for approximately 6-7 months from the trading commencement date. Only after lock-in expiry will these shares contribute to free float.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect of 63.55 lakh additional shares, though the impact on voting rights and shareholding pattern will depend on the company's total outstanding shares. The lock-in period provides some protection against immediate dilution-related price pressure.
