This change is implemented as part of BSE's surveillance measures to monitor trading activity in these securities.

## Key Points

## Affected Securities

| Scrip Code | Scrip Name | Revised Price Band |
|------------|------------|--------------------|
| 537292 | Agri-Tech (India) Ltd | 10% |
| 544169 | Amkay Products Ltd | 5% |
| 535719 | Ampvolts Ltd | 10% |
| 544160 | Jay Kailash Namkeen Ltd | 5% |

| 530459 | Valson Industries Ltd | 5% |

## Regulatory Changes

BSE has reduced price bands from existing levels to either 5% or 10% for the eight mentioned scrips. Price band restrictions limit the maximum price movement allowed for a security during a trading session, serving as a circuit breaker mechanism.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands from December 18, 2025
- All trades in affected scrips must be executed within the new price band limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 17, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 18, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The imposition of tighter price bands (5% and 10%) typically indicates heightened surveillance due to volatility concerns, unusual price movements, or other market integrity considerations. This will:

- Limit intraday price volatility for affected securities
- Potentially reduce trading volumes due to restricted price movement
- Provide investor protection against extreme price swings
- Signal increased regulatory scrutiny on these securities
- May impact liquidity and trading strategies for market participants
