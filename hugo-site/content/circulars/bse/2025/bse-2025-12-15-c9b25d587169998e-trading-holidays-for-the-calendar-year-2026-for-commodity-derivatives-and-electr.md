## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The holiday calendar affects trading availability for commodity derivatives and EGR segments throughout 2026. The mix of full-day and partial-day closures requires careful planning by market participants.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to incorporate these holidays into their 2026 operational calendars, settlement schedules, and risk management systems. The distinction between morning and evening session closures is particularly important for commodity derivatives markets which operate across extended hours.

**Planning Considerations**: The advance notice allows sufficient time for system updates, client communications, and operational adjustments. The special Muhurat Trading session on November 8, 2026 will require separate preparation once timings are announced.
