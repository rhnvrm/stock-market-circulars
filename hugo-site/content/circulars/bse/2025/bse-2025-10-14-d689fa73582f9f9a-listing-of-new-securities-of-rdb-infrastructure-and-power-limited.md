## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment**: June 6, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: October 15, 2025 (Wednesday)
- **Lock-in Expiry (Tier 1)**: April 30, 2026 - for 72,50,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 19,03,84,001 to 197634001)
- **Lock-in Expiry (Tier 2)**: April 30, 2027 - for 1,75,50,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 172834001 to 19,03,84,000)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The listing adds 24.8 million shares to RDB Infrastructure's equity base, representing significant dilution. The staggered lock-in structure (70.77% locked until April 2027, 29.23% until April 2026) provides some protection against immediate supply pressure.

**Liquidity Impact**: The immediate tradable float will not include these shares due to lock-in restrictions. Full liquidity impact will be felt progressively as lock-ins expire in 2026 and 2027.

**Investor Consideration**: Existing shareholders should note the equity dilution and monitor the company's utilization of funds raised through warrant conversion. The preferential allotment to both promoters and non-promoters at Rs. 40.50 per share provides a reference price point for valuation.
