## Summary

BSE has issued notice 20251216-19 informing trading members about the new ISIN number for Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Ltd (Scrip Code: 543273) following the sub-division of equity shares. The new ISIN number INE0CJD01029 will become effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of December 22, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN Number: INE0CJD01029
- Company: KNOWLEDGE MARINE & ENGINEERING WORKS LTD
- Scrip Code: 543273
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Rs.5/-
- Ex-Date: December 22, 2025
- Demat Request (DR) Number: 782/2025-2026
- Notice continues from previous Exchange Notice No. 20251126-16 dated November 26, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The company's ISIN will change from the previous identifier to INE0CJD01029 to reflect the new face value of equity shares post sub-division. This change is mandated to ensure proper identification and tracking of the subdivided shares in trading and settlement systems.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to recognize the new ISIN number INE0CJD01029
- All trades executed on or after December 22, 2025 must use the new ISIN
- The new ISIN corresponds to equity shares with face value of Rs.5/- each (post sub-division)
- Systems must be configured to handle the transition from the old ISIN to the new ISIN on the ex-date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 16, 2025
- **Ex-Date:** December 22, 2025 (effective date for new ISIN)
- **Previous Notice Reference:** November 26, 2025 (Notice No. 20251126-16)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares while reducing the face value, potentially improving liquidity and making shares more accessible to retail investors. The price per share will adjust proportionally.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and market participants must ensure their systems are updated to handle the new ISIN from the ex-date. Shareholders will see their holdings reflected in the new denomination (twice the number of shares at half the face value).

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders will receive subdivided shares in the ratio of 2:1 (one share of Rs.10/- becoming two shares of Rs.5/-). No action is required from shareholders as the adjustment will be automatic in demat accounts.
