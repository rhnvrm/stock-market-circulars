This is in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251014-5 dated October 14, 2025. The new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date of November 3, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN Number: INE258A01024
- Company: BEML Ltd (Scrip Code: 500048)
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Old Face Value: Rs.10/- per share
- New Face Value: Rs.5/- per share
- Effective Date: November 3, 2025 (Ex-Date)
- Debenture Reference: DR-748/2025-2026
- Notice Reference: Continuation of Notice No. 20251014-5 dated October 14, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action where the company has subdivided its equity shares, requiring a new ISIN to be issued for the shares with revised face value.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN number INE258A01024 for BEML Ltd equity shares
- All trades executed on or after November 3, 2025 must use the new ISIN
- Demat accounts and holdings will be adjusted to reflect the sub-divided shares
- Market participants should ensure proper mapping of old and new ISINs in their trading and settlement systems

## Important Dates

- **October 14, 2025**: Original announcement (Notice No. 20251014-5)
- **October 30, 2025**: New ISIN confirmation notice issued
- **November 3, 2025**: Ex-date - New ISIN becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The sub-division increases the number of shares outstanding while reducing the per-share price, potentially improving liquidity and making shares more accessible to retail investors. No change in market capitalization or shareholder value.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members, custodians, and depository participants must ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN before the ex-date. Existing shareholders will automatically receive additional shares in their demat accounts in the ratio of 2:1 (each share of Rs.10/- becomes 2 shares of Rs.5/-).

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their shareholding doubled with proportionate reduction in price per share. No action required from investors as the adjustment is automatic through depository systems.
