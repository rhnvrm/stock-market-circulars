## Summary

BSE has issued a new ISIN number INE0CJD01029 for Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Ltd (Scrip Code: 543273) following the sub-division of equity shares. The existing equity shares with face value of Rs.10/- each will be sub-divided into shares of Rs.5/- each. This new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date of December 22, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN Number: INE0CJD01029
- Company: Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Ltd
- Scrip Code: 543273
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Rs.5/-
- New Face Value: Rs.5/- per equity share
- Ex-Date: December 22, 2025
- DR Reference: 782/2025-2026
- Notice Reference: Continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251126-16 dated November 26, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action implementing a stock split through equity share sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN INE0CJD01029 for trades from December 22, 2025 onwards
- All trades executed on or after the ex-date must use the new ISIN for sub-divided shares with face value of Rs.5/-
- Market participants must ensure proper mapping of old and new ISIN in their trading and settlement systems

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 16, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: December 22, 2025 (trades from this date will use new ISIN)
- **Previous Notice**: November 26, 2025 (Exchange Notice No. 20251126-16)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Moderate - The sub-division increases the number of outstanding shares and reduces the per-share price, potentially improving liquidity and making shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants must update their systems with the new ISIN before the ex-date to ensure seamless trading and settlement. The stock split does not change the total market capitalization but requires technical adjustments to trading infrastructure.

**Shareholder Impact**: Shareholders will receive double the number of shares at half the face value, maintaining the same investment value. This is a neutral event from a valuation perspective but may enhance trading activity.
