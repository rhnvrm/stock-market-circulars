## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: None. This is a mock trading session with no impact on actual market operations or live trading.

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium for trading members. Members have the opportunity to test their systems in a controlled environment before new features (Pre-Open Session and Reserved contracts) go live on December 08, 2025. This reduces operational risk during actual implementation.

**Technical Impact**: Members using third-party platforms, empaneled vendors, or in-house systems can validate their applications for various scenarios including exceptional market conditions. The release of BOLT Pro TWS version 12.40 requires testing to ensure smooth transition.

**Compliance Impact**: Supports members in meeting regulatory testing requirements under SEBI guidelines. Optional participation with alternative UAT environment available.
