## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: High - The revised ratio of 29:2 represents a substantial rights offering that significantly differs from the original terms announced on October 07, 2025. Existing shareholders must be aware of this change to make informed investment decisions.

**Market Impact**: Immediate - The ex-rights date is October 10, 2025, giving minimal notice period. Shares will trade ex-rights from this date.
