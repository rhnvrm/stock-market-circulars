## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 9 securities with changes in surveillance status. The addition of 4 securities to ST-ASM may result in reduced liquidity and increased margin requirements for these stocks. The removal of 5 securities (3 moving to stricter Trade for Trade framework) indicates ongoing regulatory monitoring.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities will face:
- Enhanced margin requirements for newly added securities
- Potential liquidity constraints
- Modified trading parameters
- For securities moving to Trade for Trade: stricter settlement requirements and no intraday trading

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and trading members must update their surveillance systems and communicate changes to affected clients before the effective date.
