title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities Movement Updates
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework effective November 26, 2025. Four securities will move to higher ESM stages while no new securities are being added to the framework and none are being removed. The circular includes a consolidated list of securities currently under various ESM stages.

## Key Points

- No new securities shortlisted for ESM Framework
- 4 securities moving to higher ESM stages: CHPL Industries Ltd (539335), MRC Agrotech Ltd (540809), SAB Events & Governance Now Media Ltd (540081), and Svarnim Trade Udyog Ltd (539911)
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages
- No securities exiting the ESM Framework
- Consolidated list includes 28+ securities across different ESM stages
- Changes effective from November 26, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM Framework continues to operate with existing parameters. Securities under ESM are subject to additional surveillance measures based on their stage classification (Stage I, Stage II, etc.). Movement to higher stages indicates increased regulatory scrutiny and may involve stricter trading conditions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with ESM framework requirements for affected securities
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting obligations apply to securities in ESM
- Investors should be aware of the surveillance status when trading these securities
- Securities moving to higher stages may face additional restrictions or margin requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 26, 2025 - ESM stage changes come into effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The movement of 4 securities to higher ESM stages indicates increased regulatory concern about trading patterns or compliance issues in these stocks. This typically results in reduced liquidity and increased trading costs for these securities.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and investors dealing in these securities will face stricter surveillance measures. The stable count of securities entering and exiting the framework suggests the ESM mechanism is functioning as intended without major market disruptions.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders of the 4 affected securities should note the increased surveillance, which may affect stock liquidity and trading behavior. The consolidated list provides transparency on all securities under ESM monitoring.
