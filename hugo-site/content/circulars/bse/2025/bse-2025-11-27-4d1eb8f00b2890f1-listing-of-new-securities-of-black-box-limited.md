## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The number of shares being listed (60,752) represents a relatively small addition to the existing equity base. 

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible immediate impact as all shares are under lock-in until June 10, 2026, preventing trading by allottees.

**Shareholder Impact:** Dilution effect is minimal given the small quantity of shares. Non-promoter holding will increase marginally.

**Trading Impact:** No expected impact on trading volumes or price discovery as locked-in shares cannot be traded for approximately 6.5 months from trading commencement date.
