**System Impact:** Medium - New BOLT Pro TWS version 12.40 requires validation. Members using third-party platforms or in-house systems must ensure compatibility and proper functioning of IML/ETI API integrations.

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a testing session with no impact on actual market operations. However, successful testing is critical for smooth implementation of new features from December 08, 2025.
