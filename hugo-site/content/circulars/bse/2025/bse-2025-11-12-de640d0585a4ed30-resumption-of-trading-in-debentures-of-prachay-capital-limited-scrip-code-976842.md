---

## Summary

BSE has announced the resumption of trading in three series of debentures issued by PRACHAY CAPITAL LIMITED (Scrip Codes 976842, 976849 & 976850) effective November 13, 2025. Trading was previously suspended to facilitate the exercise of put options by debenture holders. Since no debenture holders exercised their put options for early redemption, the company has requested to resume trading in these securities.

## Key Points

- Trading to resume in three debenture series: Scrip Codes 976842, 976849, and 976850
- Effective date for trading resumption: November 13, 2025
- Put options were not exercised by any debenture holders
- Previous record dates were set for October 24, 2025, September 19, 2025, and October 9, 2025
- The put options were related to payment of interest and early redemption opportunities
- Notice reference: DR-755/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a procedural notice regarding the resumption of normal trading operations following the completion of a put option exercise period.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are requested to note the availability of these debentures for trading from November 13, 2025
- Normal trading procedures and settlement cycles will apply
- No specific compliance actions required beyond standard debt market trading protocols

## Important Dates

- **November 12, 2025**: Notice issued by BSE
- **November 13, 2025**: Trading resumes in debentures with Scrip Codes 976842, 976849 & 976850
- **Previous Record Dates**: October 24, 2025, September 19, 2025, and October 9, 2025 (for interest payment and put option exercise)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This affects only the debt segment and involves a single issuer's debentures. The fact that no put options were exercised indicates debenture holders are satisfied with continuing to hold the securities, suggesting confidence in the issuer's credit profile.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members can now include these three debenture series in their debt trading operations. Liquidity may be limited given the specialized nature of corporate debentures.

**Investor Impact**: Existing debenture holders who chose not to exercise their put options will continue to hold their positions and receive scheduled interest payments. The securities will now be available for secondary market trading.
