## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational circular with minimal market impact. Investors holding units in the mentioned international/offshore mutual fund schemes will not be able to place purchase, redemption, or switch transactions on the specified non-business days. The closure aligns with holiday schedules in international markets where the underlying assets are traded. No impact on domestic equity trading or regular mutual fund schemes.
