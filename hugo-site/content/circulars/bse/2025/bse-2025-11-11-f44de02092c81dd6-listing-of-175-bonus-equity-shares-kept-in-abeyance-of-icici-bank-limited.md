## Impact Assessment

The impact is minimal as this involves a small quantity of 175 bonus shares being released from abeyance status. This is an administrative action completing the bonus share distribution process for ICICI Bank. The shares were likely kept in abeyance due to pending documentation or shareholder-specific issues that have now been resolved. Market liquidity impact is negligible given the small quantity relative to ICICI Bank's total outstanding shares.
