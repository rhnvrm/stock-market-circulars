## Regulatory Framework

The Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) is a framework implemented by stock exchanges to enhance market surveillance and protect investor interests. Securities are placed under GSM based on various criteria including price movements, volume variations, market capitalization, and other surveillance parameters.

- GSM Stage IV: Higher surveillance with more stringent trading conditions including potential additional margins and trade-to-trade settlement

**Special Notations:**
- Securities marked (#) move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- Securities marked ($) move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in IBC Framework
- (*) Indicates alignment with NSE classifications

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors trading in these securities should be aware of the enhanced surveillance measures applicable
- Additional margin requirements may apply for securities in higher GSM stages
- Settlement cycles may be modified to trade-for-trade basis
- Brokers and trading members must ensure compliance with GSM-specific trading conditions
- Investors should exercise increased caution and conduct thorough due diligence before trading in GSM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 9, 2025
- **Circular Date**: December 9, 2025

## Impact Assessment
