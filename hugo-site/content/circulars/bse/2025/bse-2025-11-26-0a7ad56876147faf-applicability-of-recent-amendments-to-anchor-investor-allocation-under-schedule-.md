## Summary

The amendments introduce tiered allocation limits based on issue size and mandate specific reservations for domestic mutual funds (33.33%), life insurance companies, and pension funds (6.67%). The regulation becomes effective three days from October 31, 2025 publication date.

- Introduces tiered allocation structure based on issue size thresholds of Rs 250 crore
- Minimum investment per anchor investor: Rs 5 crore
- 40% of anchor investor portion reserved for specified institutional categories

## Regulatory Changes

### Allocation Limits Amendment [Para 10(g)(I)]

**For issues up to Rs 250 crore:**
- Minimum 2 anchor investors required
- Maximum 15 anchor investors permitted
- Each investor must receive minimum Rs 5 crore allocation

**For issues exceeding Rs 250 crore:**
- First Rs 250 crore: minimum 5 investors, maximum 15 investors
- Each subsequent Rs 250 crore (or less): additional 15 investors permitted
- Each investor must receive minimum Rs 5 crore allocation

### Reservation Requirements [Para 10(gh)]

40% of anchor investor allocation (within limits specified in sub-para kh) reserved as follows:

1. **Indian Mutual Funds: 33.33%**
2. **Life Insurance Companies and Pension Funds: 6.67%**

**Undersubscription provision:** Any undersubscribed portion from the 6.67% life insurance/pension fund reservation can be allocated to Indian mutual funds.

### Definitions Added

- **Life Insurance Company:** Entity registered with Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India under Insurance Act, 1938
- **Pension Fund:** Fund registered with Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority under PFRDA Act, 2013

## Compliance Requirements

### For Issuers

- Apply new allocation structure for determining maximum anchor investors
- Ensure 40% of anchor portion is reserved per specified breakup
- Allocate undersubscribed life insurance/pension fund portion to mutual funds
- Maintain minimum Rs 5 crore allocation per anchor investor

### For Book Running Lead Managers

- Implement revised allocation mechanism in anchor book building
- Verify investor categorization (mutual funds, insurance, pension funds)
- Apply reservation waterfall: life insurance/pension funds first, then mutual funds for remaining
- Ensure compliance with investor number caps per issue size tier

### For Anchor Investors

- Minimum bid amount: Rs 5 crore per investor
- Mutual funds have priority access to any undersubscribed reserved portion

## Important Dates

- **Notification Date:** October 31, 2025
- **Effective Date:** Three days from October 31, 2025 (approximately November 3, 2025)
- **Applicability:** All IPOs with anchor investor portions post-effective date

## Impact Assessment

### Market Impact

- **Enhanced participation:** Tiered structure allows more anchor investors in larger issues, potentially improving price discovery
- **Domestic institutional priority:** 40% reservation strengthens domestic institutional participation in IPO pricing
- **Mutual fund advantage:** MF industry gets 33.33% reserved allocation plus access to undersubscribed insurance/pension quota

### Operational Impact

- **Issue structuring:** Issuers must calculate maximum anchor investors based on multiple Rs 250 crore tranches
- **Allocation complexity:** BRLMs need systems to handle tiered investor caps and cascading reservation waterfall
- **Documentation:** Enhanced disclosure requirements for reserved category compliance

### Regulatory Impact

- Aligns with SEBI's objective of strengthening domestic institutional participation
- Reduces concentration risk by capping investors per tranche
- Provides preference to regulated domestic long-term investors (pension funds, insurance)
- May reduce dependency on foreign anchor investors in large issues
