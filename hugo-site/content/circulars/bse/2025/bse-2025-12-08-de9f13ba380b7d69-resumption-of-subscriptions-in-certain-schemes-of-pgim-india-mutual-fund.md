title: Resumption of subscriptions in certain schemes of PGIM India Mutual Fund
---

## Summary

PGIM India Mutual Fund has announced the resumption of subscriptions in three designated schemes effective December 08, 2025, following SEBI's permission to accept subscriptions within available overseas investment headroom. The schemes include PGIM India Global Equity Opportunities Fund of Fund, PGIM India Emerging Markets Equity Fund of Fund, and PGIM India Global Select Real Estate Securities Fund of Fund. Subscriptions were previously suspended on November 17, 2025.

## Key Points

- Subscriptions reopened in three PGIM India fund of fund schemes from December 08, 2025
- Lumpsum transactions capped at INR 2,00,00,000 (INR 2 crore) per day, per investor, per scheme at Primary holder PAN level
- Transactions must be received before cut-off time on any business day
- No fresh SIP, STP registrations or switch-ins allowed
- Existing registered SIPs/STPs in designated schemes will continue
- Resumption based on SEBI letter dated June 17, 2022 permitting investments within overseas investment limits

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI vide letter no. SEBI/HO/OW/IMD-II/DoF3/P/25095/2022 dated June 17, 2022 has permitted Mutual Funds to accept subscriptions and invest in overseas funds/securities up to the headroom available without breaching the overseas investment limits as of end of day February 1, 2022 at Mutual Fund level.

## Compliance Requirements

- Unit holders requested to update PAN, KYC, email address, mobile number, and nominee details with AMC
- Unit holders advised to link PAN with Aadhaar Number
- Investors can view Investor Charter on mutual fund website
- Unit holders should check for unclaimed redemptions or Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) payments

## Important Dates

- **November 17, 2025**: Subscriptions temporarily suspended in designated schemes
- **December 04, 2025**: Notice cum addendum issued
- **December 08, 2025**: Subscriptions resumed in designated schemes with specified limits
- **February 1, 2022**: Reference date for overseas investment limits (EOD)

## Impact Assessment

The resumption of subscriptions has limited market impact as it affects only three fund of fund schemes with international exposure. The INR 2 crore daily limit per investor provides controlled access while managing overseas investment constraints. Retail and institutional investors can resume lumpsum investments but cannot register new systematic plans, which may limit participation from smaller investors preferring SIP routes. The restriction on fresh SIPs/STPs indicates continued caution on overseas investment limits despite the reopening.
