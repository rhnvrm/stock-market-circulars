## Impact Assessment

This is a company-specific corporate action with minimal market impact. It affects only the holders of SHARE INDIA SECURITIES LIMITED's non-convertible debentures. The part redemption reduces the face value to Rs. 75,000 per debenture, returning capital to debenture holders while maintaining the debt instrument in circulation at reduced value. Trading members need to adjust their systems to reflect the new face value from November 25, 2025.
