## Regulatory Changes

BSE Surveillance Department has revised price bands for the listed scrips as part of market regulation measures. Price bands are circuit filters that limit the maximum price movement allowed for a security during a trading session. Tighter bands (2%) indicate higher surveillance and restricted price volatility, while wider bands (10%) allow greater price movement within the trading session.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement the revised price bands from December 12, 2025
- All trades in the affected scrips must comply with the new price band limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE at bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect the new price band parameters

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 11, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 12, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revision of price bands directly affects trading dynamics for these 12 scrips. Stricter bands (2%) on three scrips suggest heightened surveillance concerns, potentially due to excessive volatility or other market integrity issues. These restrictions will limit intraday price movements and may reduce speculative trading activity.

**Trading Impact**: Investors and traders in these securities will face constraints on maximum daily price movements. The 2% band scrips will have the most restricted trading range, while 10% band scrips retain broader movement capability. This affects both day trading strategies and stop-loss orders.

**Investor Consideration**: The price band revision serves as a regulatory indicator of market concerns about specific securities, and investors should exercise appropriate caution when trading in these scrips, particularly those with the tightest (2%) bands.
