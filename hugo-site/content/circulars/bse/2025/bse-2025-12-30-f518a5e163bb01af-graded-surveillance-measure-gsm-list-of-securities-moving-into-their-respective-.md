---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of 10 securities into different stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. The securities are being moved to GSM Stages I through IV based on surveillance parameters. This action indicates enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions on these securities.

## Key Points

- 2 securities moving to GSM Stage I: Welterman International Ltd., Khyati Multimedia-Entertainment
- 3 securities moving to GSM Stage II: Futuristic Securities Ltd., Vintage Securities Ltd., Ambassador Intra Holdings Limited
- 1 security moving to GSM Stage III: Lynx Machinery & Commercials Ltd.
- 4 securities moving to GSM Stage IV: Bijoy Hans Ltd., Procal Electronics India Ltd., Capfin India Limited, Aar Shyam India Investment Company Limited
- Securities marked with special symbols may be moving to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in ESM or IBC frameworks
- Movement is aligned with NSE actions

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework applies progressive surveillance measures as securities move through stages I to IV. Each stage typically involves:

- Additional margin requirements for trading
- Price band restrictions
- Trade-for-trade settlement (in higher stages)
- Enhanced reporting obligations

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of applicable trading restrictions for securities in different GSM stages
- Brokers should inform clients about the GSM status of these securities
- Investors should note the additional margin requirements and settlement obligations
- Listed companies must comply with enhanced disclosure norms applicable to their GSM stage

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: December 30, 2025
- Effective Date: To be implemented as per BSE surveillance guidelines

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 10 securities with varying degrees of surveillance measures. Higher GSM stages may reduce liquidity and increase trading costs for these specific stocks.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities will face stricter trading conditions, including higher margins and potentially trade-for-trade settlement in higher stages.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new GSM classifications and ensure compliance with applicable margin and settlement requirements.
