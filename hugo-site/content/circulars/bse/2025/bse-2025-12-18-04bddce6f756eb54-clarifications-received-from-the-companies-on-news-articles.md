## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The news caused temporary stock price volatility with a 7% intraday decline, though the company's clarification emphasizes complete separation from the ex-promoter since 2023.

**Legal Impact**: The FIR and ongoing investigations target the ex-promoter and five corporate groups, not the current company. However, the company's former association (as Indiabulls Housing Finance) may continue to attract media attention.

**Operational Impact**: No direct operational impact as the company has been operating independently of Gehlaut for over two years. The company maintains timely disclosure practices regarding ongoing court proceedings.

**Reputational Impact**: Potential short-term reputational concerns due to historical association, mitigated by transparent disclosures and complete separation from the individuals under investigation.
