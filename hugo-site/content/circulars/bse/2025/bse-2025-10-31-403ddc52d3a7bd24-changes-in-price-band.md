title: Revision of Price Bands for 60 Securities Effective November 3, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price band limits for 60 securities with effect from November 3, 2025. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20%, indicating varying levels of surveillance measures based on trading patterns and risk assessments. Trading members are required to adhere to these new price band restrictions.

## Key Points

- 60 securities will have revised price band percentages
- Effective date: November 3, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 20% (less restrictive)
- Two securities (Amit Securities Ltd and Cubical Financial Services Ltd) have the most restrictive 2% price band
- Multiple securities assigned 5% price band (34 stocks)
- Several securities assigned 10% price band (17 stocks)
- Seven securities assigned 20% price band
- Notice issued by BSE Surveillance department

## Regulatory Changes

Price band restrictions have been modified from their existing levels for the listed securities. Price bands limit the maximum price movement (up or down) that a security can experience in a single trading session, serving as a circuit breaker mechanism to prevent excessive volatility.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure trades in the affected securities comply with the new price band limits
- Orders exceeding the revised price band will be rejected or placed in the trade-for-trade segment
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Members must update their trading systems to reflect the new price band limits before the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 31, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 3, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The revision of price bands indicates enhanced surveillance measures for these securities, likely due to concerns about volatility, liquidity, or unusual trading patterns. Tighter price bands (2% and 5%) will significantly restrict intraday price movements, potentially reducing trading volumes and liquidity in these stocks. Traders and investors in these securities should adjust their strategies to account for limited intraday price movement potential. The measure aims to protect investors from excessive volatility while allowing price discovery within controlled limits.
