## Impact Assessment

The impact is minimal as this involves a very small number of shares (276) being released from abeyance. This represents an insignificant fraction of Tata Consumer Products' total equity and will have no material impact on trading volumes, liquidity, or stock price. The shares were already part of the authorized capital structure under a scheme and are now being formally listed for trading.
