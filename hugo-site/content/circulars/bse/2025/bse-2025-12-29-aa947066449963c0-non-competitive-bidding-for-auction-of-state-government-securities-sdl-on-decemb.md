## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The auction involves a substantial Rs. 37,450 crores across 29 securities, providing investment opportunities in state government debt instruments. The inclusion of multiple states and varying tenures (2029-2046) offers diversification options for debt market participants.

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium - Trading members and direct investors need to ensure system access to the NCB-GSec module and meet the tight bidding timelines. The 24-hour window for direct investors and overnight deadline for members requires operational readiness.

**Investor Impact**: Medium - Retail and institutional investors gain access to SDL securities through the non-competitive route, avoiding competitive auction dynamics. The minimum investment of Rs. 10,000 makes these securities accessible to a broader investor base.

**Contact Support**: BSE has provided dedicated contact information for user ID creation, bidding queries, and settlement-related issues through Trading Operations and ICCL Operations teams.
