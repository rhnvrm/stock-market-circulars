The participation of four funds with substantial allocations totaling Rs. 6.08 crores (9,36,000 shares × Rs. 65) demonstrates investor interest in the agricultural technology sector. The allocation sets the anchor price benchmark at Rs. 65.00, which will serve as a reference point for the main book building process. This is a positive signal for the upcoming public issue and may influence retail investor sentiment.
