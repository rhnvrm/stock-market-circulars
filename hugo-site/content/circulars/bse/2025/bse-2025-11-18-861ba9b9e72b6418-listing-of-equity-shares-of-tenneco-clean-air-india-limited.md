**Liquidity:** Approximately 63.5 million shares (15.7% of total) are immediately tradable without lock-in restrictions. Additional tranches will become liquid at various intervals through May 2027.

**Investor Consideration:** The company's history includes significant capital reduction (563.6 million shares cancelled via NCLT orders), which investors should consider when evaluating the company's corporate actions history. The distinctive number variation reflects this past restructuring.
