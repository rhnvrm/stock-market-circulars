## Summary

BSE has announced that PULSAR INTERNATIONAL LIMITED (Scrip Code: 512591) has fixed December 22, 2025 as the record date for its rights issue. Shareholders will be entitled to subscribe to 5 new equity shares of Re.1/- each at par for every 1 equity share held. Trading in the company's equity shares will be conducted on an ex-rights basis from December 22, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-782/2025-2026).

## Key Points

- Company: PULSAR INTERNATIONAL LIMITED (Scrip Code: 512591)
- Rights ratio: 5 equity shares for every 1 equity share held
- Face value: Re.1/- per share
- Issue price: Re.1/- per share (at par)
- Payment terms: Full amount payable on application
- Record date: December 22, 2025
- Ex-rights date: December 22, 2025
- Settlement number: DR-782/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard corporate action notification regarding a rights issue.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must execute all transactions in PULSAR INTERNATIONAL LIMITED equity shares on an ex-rights basis from December 22, 2025
- Members must ensure proper settlement and recording of rights entitlements
- Full issue price of Re.1/- per share must be paid at the time of application

## Important Dates

- **December 17, 2025**: Circular issued
- **December 22, 2025**: Record date for determining rights entitlement
- **December 22, 2025**: Ex-rights trading begins (Settlement No. DR-782/2025-2026)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The 5:1 rights ratio represents a substantial increase in share capital (500% expansion). This will significantly dilute existing shareholding for those who do not participate in the rights issue.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders must be present on the register as of the record date to be eligible for rights entitlement. The ex-rights trading from December 22, 2025 means shares purchased on or after this date will not carry rights entitlement.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must adjust their systems to handle ex-rights trading and ensure proper allocation of rights to eligible shareholders. The low issue price (Re.1/-) makes the rights issue attractive for participation.
