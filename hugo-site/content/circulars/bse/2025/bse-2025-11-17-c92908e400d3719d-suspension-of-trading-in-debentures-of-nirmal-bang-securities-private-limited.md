## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This affects only a specific series of private placement debentures from NIRMAL BANG SECURITIES PRIVATE LIMITED. As these are privately placed NCDs with limited trading activity, the market impact is minimal.

**Investor Impact**: Medium for affected debenture holders - Investors holding these debentures will not be able to trade them from November 25, 2025. However, this is a planned redemption, so investors on record as of the record date will receive their redemption proceeds.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Standard redemption procedure requiring trading members to update their systems to block trading in the specified ISIN from the suspension date.
