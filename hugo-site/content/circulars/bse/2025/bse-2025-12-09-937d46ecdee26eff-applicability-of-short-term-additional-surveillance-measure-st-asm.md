## Regulatory Framework

The Short Term ASM framework is designed to:
- Monitor securities with abnormal price movements over short periods (5/15/30 days)
- Apply progressive stages of surveillance measures
- Require higher margins for trading in affected securities
- Restrict certain types of trading activities
- Securities can move between stages or frameworks based on market behavior

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors trading in ST-ASM securities must maintain higher margins as prescribed
- Trading members must ensure compliance with surveillance measure requirements
- Enhanced disclosure and monitoring obligations apply to these securities
- Securities may have restricted trading or trade-for-trade settlement

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 10, 2025
- All changes to ST-ASM applicability come into effect from this date

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ST-ASM face increased margins (up to 100%), reduced leverage, and potential trade-for-trade settlement, making them less attractive for short-term trading and speculation.

**Investor Impact**: Existing investors in these securities may face higher capital requirements and reduced liquidity. New investors should exercise caution given the surveillance measures.

**Market Impact**: The framework aims to curb excessive speculation and protect investor interests by cooling down overheated securities, though it may temporarily reduce trading volumes in affected stocks.
