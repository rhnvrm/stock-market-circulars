## Impact Assessment

This shareholding pattern disclosure represents the post-listing structure of Orkla India Limited. The 75-25 promoter-public split meets minimum public shareholding requirements for listed entities. The high dematerialization rate (88.32%) indicates strong adoption of demat holdings. The absence of encumbrances, pledges, or locked-in shares suggests a clean capital structure. The presence of 720,197 outstanding convertible securities results in a marginally diluted shareholding of 100.53% on a fully diluted basis. This is a routine disclosure with no adverse implications for investors or market participants.
