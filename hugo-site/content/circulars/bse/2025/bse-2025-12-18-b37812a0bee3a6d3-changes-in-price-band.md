## Compliance Requirements

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: December 18, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 19, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The price band revisions will restrict intraday price movements for these 19 scrips, potentially reducing volatility but also limiting trading opportunities. Tighter bands (2-5%) indicate heightened surveillance concerns and may signal higher risk profiles.

**Liquidity Impact**: Stricter price bands may reduce liquidity as traders face limited price movement scope within trading sessions. This could widen bid-ask spreads and impact execution quality.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these securities should be aware of limited daily price movement potential. Those with pending orders should review price limits. The restrictions suggest these scrips are under enhanced surveillance for various reasons including volatility, corporate action concerns, or compliance issues.
