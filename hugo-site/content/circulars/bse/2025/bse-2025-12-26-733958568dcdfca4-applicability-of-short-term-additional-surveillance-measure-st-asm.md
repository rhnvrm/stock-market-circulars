## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective December 29, 2025. The circular identifies 9 new securities entering the ST-ASM framework, 15 securities exiting the framework (moving to other surveillance categories or normal trading), and provides a consolidated list of securities under ST-ASM. The ST-ASM framework is designed to monitor securities with unusual price movements or trading patterns over short periods (5/15/30 days).

## Key Points

- 9 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages within the ST-ASM framework

- 1 security (Amines & Plasticizers Limited) in consolidated list at Stage I
- Changes effective from December 29, 2025
- Some securities marked with special designations (SME, T+0, NSE-aligned)

## Regulatory Changes

Securities entering ST-ASM will be subject to additional surveillance measures including potential restrictions on trading, higher margins, or trade-for-trade segments. The framework operates in stages with progressively stricter measures.

Securities exiting ST-ASM are transitioning to:
- Long Term ASM Framework (LT-ASM): 1 security
- Trade for Trade Framework: 4 securities
- Normal trading status: 10 securities

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ST-ASM framework requirements for affected securities
- Increased margin requirements may apply to securities under ST-ASM
- Investors should note potential trading restrictions on shortlisted securities
- Risk management systems must account for securities under surveillance

## Impact Assessment

**For Securities Entering ST-ASM**: Investors holding these 9 securities will face enhanced surveillance measures, potentially including reduced liquidity, higher trading margins, and increased volatility monitoring. This may impact trading volumes and price discovery.

**For Securities Exiting ST-ASM**: The 15 securities moving out represent a mixed impact - 4 securities moving to stricter Trade for Trade framework will continue facing restrictions, while 10 returning to normal trading should see improved liquidity and reduced trading costs.

**Market Impact**: Limited broader market impact as affected securities represent small-cap and mid-cap stocks with relatively lower trading volumes. Primarily affects specific stock holders and traders in these securities.
