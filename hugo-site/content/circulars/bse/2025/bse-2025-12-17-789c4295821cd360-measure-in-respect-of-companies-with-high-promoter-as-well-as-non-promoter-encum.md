## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements surveillance measures under Regulation 28(3) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulation 2011, which deals with encumbrance of shares. The framework is designed to monitor companies where significant portions of promoter and non-promoter holdings are pledged or encumbered, posing potential risks to shareholders.

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies under this framework must comply with enhanced disclosure requirements regarding encumbrance of shares
- Trading members and investors should be aware of heightened surveillance on these securities
- Companies must maintain compliance with SEBI SAST Regulation 28(3) regarding disclosure of encumbrance
- Market participants should exercise additional caution when trading in these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 18, 2025
- **Circular Date**: December 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Securities under this framework face enhanced surveillance, which may affect liquidity and investor sentiment. The presence of high encumbrance indicates financial stress or leverage, potentially leading to forced selling if lenders invoke pledges.

**Investor Impact**: High - Investors in these securities face elevated risk due to high encumbrance levels. In case of default or invocation of pledged shares, there could be significant price volatility and potential change in control.

**Operational Impact**: Companies on this list may face reputational concerns and increased scrutiny from regulators and investors. They may need to take corrective actions to reduce encumbrance levels to exit this framework.
