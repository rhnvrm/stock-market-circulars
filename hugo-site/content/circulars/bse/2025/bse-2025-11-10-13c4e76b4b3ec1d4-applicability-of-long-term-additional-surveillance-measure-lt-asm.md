- Additional margins or position limits
- Increased scrutiny of trading patterns

- Higher surveillance on price movements

**Investor Impact:** Existing holders of these securities should be aware of the enhanced surveillance classification, which signals BSE's concern about volatility, price manipulation risks, or other market integrity issues in these stocks.
