## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine commercial paper listing that adds short-term debt instruments to the BSE Debt segment. The listing provides an additional trading avenue for institutional investors and debt market participants.

**Operational Impact**: Limited to trading members dealing in debt securities. The high credit ratings (A1+) indicate strong creditworthiness, suggesting low default risk for investors.

**Liquidity**: The Rs. 5 lakh minimum trading denomination restricts participation to institutional and high-net-worth investors, typical for commercial paper instruments.

**Investor Interest**: The discount pricing (Rs. 4,91,845.50 vs Rs. 5,00,000 face value) provides implicit yield over the 91-day tenure, making it attractive for short-term treasury management by institutional investors.
