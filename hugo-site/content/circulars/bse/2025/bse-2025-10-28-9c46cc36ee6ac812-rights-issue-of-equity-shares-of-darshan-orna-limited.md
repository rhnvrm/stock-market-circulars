## Important Dates

- **October 28, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **October 31, 2025**: Record date for rights issue eligibility
- **October 31, 2025**: Ex-rights trading begins (Settlement No. DR-747/2025-2026)

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders as of the record date will be eligible to subscribe to additional equity shares at Rs. 3/- per share, representing a 50% premium to face value. This provides an opportunity to increase shareholding proportionately.

**Trading Impact**: The stock will trade ex-rights from October 31, 2025, which typically results in a price adjustment reflecting the value of the rights being separated from the share price.

**Liquidity Impact**: Rights issues generally lead to increased share capital and may temporarily affect trading volumes as shareholders decide whether to exercise, sell, or let their rights lapse.

**Dilution**: Shareholders who do not participate in the rights issue will experience dilution of their ownership percentage, given the 1:1 ratio of the offering.
