## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine commercial paper listing that adds short-term debt instruments to BSE's debt segment. The instrument provides additional trading options for institutional investors in the debt market.

**Issuer Profile**: Axis Finance Limited is part of the Axis Bank group, and the dual A1+ ratings from CRISIL and IND indicate highest safety regarding timely payment of financial obligations.

**Trading Implications**: The instrument is restricted to institutional participants given the Rs. 5 lakh minimum denomination. The 85-day maturity makes it suitable for short-term liquidity management by institutional investors.
