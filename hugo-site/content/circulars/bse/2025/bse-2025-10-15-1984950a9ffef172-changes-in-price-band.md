## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 16, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
The revision of price bands affects intraday volatility limits for 27 securities. Tighter price bands (2% and 5%) will restrict price movements and may reduce speculative activity, while wider bands (20%) allow for greater price discovery but may increase volatility risk.

**Trading Impact:**
- Securities with narrower bands (2-5%) will have limited intraday price movement, potentially affecting liquidity
- Securities with 20% bands may experience higher volatility and trading opportunities
- Risk management systems need recalibration for affected scrips
- Circuit breakers will trigger more frequently for securities with tighter bands

**Operational Impact:**
Trading members must update their systems and inform clients about the new trading limits for these securities to avoid order rejections or unexpected circuit breaker triggers.
