The shares will be listed and permitted to trade on the Exchange with effect from Wednesday, October 29, 2025.

## Key Points

- 90,00,00,000 equity shares of Re. 1/- each issued at par value
- Issued to Non-Promoters on preferential basis through warrant conversion
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares
- Distinctive Numbers: 952201 to 900952200
- Date of Allotment: May 20, 2025
- Issue Price: Re. 1/- per share
- ISIN: INE443P01038

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the listing of these new securities
- Trading members must be aware of the lock-in restrictions applicable to all 90 crore shares until May 5, 2026
- The new shares are ranking pari-passu with old equity shares

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: May 20, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: October 29, 2025 (Wednesday)
- **Lock-in Period Ends**: May 5, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of 90 crore shares represents a substantial increase in the equity base of Pervasive Commodities Limited. However, the lock-in period until May 5, 2026 means these shares cannot be traded immediately, limiting near-term supply impact.

**Liquidity Impact**: Medium - While a large number of shares are being listed, the lock-in restriction prevents immediate trading, delaying any liquidity impact until mid-2026.

**Price Impact**: The preferential allotment at par value (Re. 1/-) to Non-Promoters through warrant conversion may indicate capital raising activities. Once the lock-in expires in May 2026, the potential sellable float will increase significantly.
