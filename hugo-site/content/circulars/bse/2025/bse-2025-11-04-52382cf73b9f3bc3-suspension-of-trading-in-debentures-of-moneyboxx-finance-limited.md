The suspension is due to the company fixing the record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are strictly advised not to deal in these debentures from the specified date.

## Key Points

- Debenture Series: MFL-13.15%-23-11-25-PVT

- Scrip Code: 975220
- Record Date: November 7, 2025

- Notice Reference: DR-751/2025-2026
- Issuer: Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard procedural suspension pursuant to corporate action requirements for debenture redemption and interest payment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must immediately cease all dealing in the specified debentures from November 7, 2025
- No buy or sell orders should be accepted for ISIN INE296Q07043 from the suspension date
- Trading members must inform their clients holding these debentures about the suspension

## Important Dates

- **November 4, 2025**: Circular issued by BSE
- **November 7, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **November 7, 2025**: Trading suspension becomes effective (no dealings from this date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High impact for holders of these specific debentures. The trading suspension prevents any secondary market transactions, ensuring that only eligible holders as of the record date receive the redemption proceeds and interest payment. 

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders cannot exit their positions after November 7, 2025. Those holding the debentures on the record date will receive redemption proceeds and interest payment as per the debenture terms. The 13.15% coupon rate suggests retail/institutional investors with fixed income exposure.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their trading systems to block orders and inform affected clients immediately. Given the short notice period (3 days), swift operational action is required to ensure compliance.
