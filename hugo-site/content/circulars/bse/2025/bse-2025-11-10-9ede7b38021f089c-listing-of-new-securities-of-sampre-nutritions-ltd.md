## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine listing notification for a preferential allotment of shares following warrant conversion. The relatively small number of shares (8.4 lakh) and lock-in restrictions minimize immediate market impact.

**Shareholder Impact**: The new shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares, maintaining equal rights for all shareholders. Lock-in periods ranging from 1-2 years ensure promoter commitment and prevent immediate selling pressure.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact on liquidity due to lock-in restrictions on all allotted shares. Trading members can process transactions in these securities from November 11, 2025.
