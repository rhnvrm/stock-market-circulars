  0
---

## Summary

BSE has updated its surveillance framework for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Effective November 25, 2025, Bil Vyapar Ltd (Scrip Code: 500059, ISIN: INE071A01013) has been added to Stage 0 surveillance following receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure regarding insolvency proceedings. No securities are being moved to Stage 1, from Stage 1 to Stage 2, or being excluded from IBC surveillance.

## Key Points

- Bil Vyapar Ltd shortlisted in Stage 0 (Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure) effective November 25, 2025
- Scrip Code: 500059, ISIN: INE071A01013
- No securities moved to Stage 1 (Additional Surveillance Measure for IRP)
- No securities moved from Stage 1 to Stage 2 or Stage 2 to Stage 1
- No securities excluded from IBC surveillance framework
- Consolidated list includes 14+ securities already under various IBC surveillance stages

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework for companies undergoing Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The framework has multiple stages:

- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company
- **Stage 1**: Additional Surveillance Measure for Companies relating to IRP
- **Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance measures

The surveillance framework applies to securities of companies that have disclosed insolvency proceedings or are undergoing resolution processes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of securities under IBC surveillance
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in affected securities
- Investors should exercise caution when trading securities under IBC surveillance stages
- Companies must provide timely disclosures regarding insolvency proceedings

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 25, 2025 - Bil Vyapar Ltd added to Stage 0 surveillance

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited immediate market-wide impact as only one security is being newly added to surveillance. However, for Bil Vyapar Ltd specifically, inclusion in IBC surveillance Stage 0 signals financial distress and may result in reduced liquidity and heightened volatility.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under IBC surveillance typically experience:
- Reduced trading volumes
- Wider bid-ask spreads
- Increased price volatility
- Potential additional trading restrictions if moved to higher surveillance stages

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding Bil Vyapar Ltd should monitor developments closely as Stage 0 is the initial surveillance level that may progress to more restrictive stages if insolvency proceedings advance. The consolidated list shows 14+ securities already under various IBC surveillance stages, indicating ongoing monitoring of financially distressed companies across the market.
