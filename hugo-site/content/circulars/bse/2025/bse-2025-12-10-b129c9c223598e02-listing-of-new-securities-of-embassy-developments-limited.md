## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing adds approximately 8.96 lakh shares to Embassy Developments Limited's equity capital, representing potential dilution for existing shareholders. However, immediate market impact is limited due to lock-in provisions until June 2026.

**Liquidity Impact**: While shares are listed and tradeable from December 11, 2025, the lock-in restrictions mean these specific shares cannot be sold until mid-2026, limiting immediate supply increase.

**Shareholding Impact**: The preferential allotment to non-promoters will alter the company's shareholding pattern, potentially reducing promoter holding percentage and increasing public float.

**Investment Consideration**: The issue price of Rs. 111.51 provides a reference point for valuation. Investors should monitor the stock's trading behavior post-listing and assess any impact on the company's fundamentals from the capital raised through warrant conversion.
