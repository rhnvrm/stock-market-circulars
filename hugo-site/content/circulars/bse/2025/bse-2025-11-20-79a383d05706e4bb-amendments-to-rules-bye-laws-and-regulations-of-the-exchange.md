## Summary

BSE has issued amendments to its Rules, Bye-laws and Regulations effective November 20, 2025. The amendments primarily update terminology related to dispute resolution processes and modify governance provisions for trade annulment and price resetting authority. Key changes include replacing references to 'arbitration' with 'dispute resolution mechanism' and streamlining the authorization process for trade modifications.

## Key Points

- Rule 3(m) of Chapter IV updated to change 'arbitration charges' to 'charges towards dispute resolution mechanism'
- Bye-law 5(b) of Chapter VII modified to change authorization from 'Board or Managing Director' to 'person(s)/committee(s) authorized by the Board'
- All amendments maintain the substance of obligations while updating procedural terminology
- Changes apply to member obligations regarding dispute resolution and fee payments
