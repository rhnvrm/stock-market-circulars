## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it relates specifically to operational procedures for SAMCO Mutual Fund's Small Cap Fund NFO investors who opted for the auto-switch facility. The activation allows seamless transition of investments from interim parking funds to the main scheme, providing operational convenience to investors. This is a standard procedure for NFO processing on the BSE StAR MF platform and does not affect broader market operations or other market participants.
