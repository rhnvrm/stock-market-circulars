## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing notification for a single company's additional shares from warrant conversion.

**Liquidity Impact**: The lock-in period until May 30, 2026 means these shares will not be available for trading in the secondary market until then, limiting immediate liquidity impact.

**Dilution**: The preferential allotment to non-promoters increases the public float and may cause dilution for existing shareholders, though the quantum represents a relatively modest increase to the existing share base.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new distribution number ranges and total outstanding shares for proper trade settlement.
