- Market participants must await separate notice regarding the new ISIN for Rs.2/- paid up shares
- All trading and settlement systems must be updated to reflect the new share structure from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **November 20, 2025**: Circular issued

- **December 12, 2025**: Effective date - old ISIN becomes invalid, new sub-divided shares begin trading

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Stock splits typically improve liquidity by making shares more affordable to retail investors, potentially increasing trading volumes. The 1:5 split will reduce the trading price per share to one-fifth of the pre-split price.

**Shareholder Impact**: No economic impact on existing shareholders - total value of holdings remains unchanged. Each shareholder will receive 5 shares for every 1 share held. Proportionate ownership remains the same.

**Operational Impact**: Exchanges, depositories, and trading systems need to update records. Brokers must ensure client accounts reflect the correct post-split share quantities. The new ISIN will be communicated separately for system updates.
