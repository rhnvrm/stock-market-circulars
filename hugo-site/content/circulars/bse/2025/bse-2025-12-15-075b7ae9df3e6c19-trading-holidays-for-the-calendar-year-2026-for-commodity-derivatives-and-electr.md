## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The holiday schedule provides advance planning information for market participants trading in commodity derivatives and electronic gold receipts. The staggered approach (some holidays affecting only morning sessions) allows for continued evening trading activity on certain festival days.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and participants need to adjust their trading strategies and operational schedules around these holidays. The evening session availability on 11 out of 16 holidays provides flexibility for market participants.

**Liquidity Impact:** Expected temporary reduction in liquidity on days with partial or full closures. The Muhurat Trading session provides a special trading opportunity traditionally associated with Diwali.

**Planning Impact:** This advance notice allows market participants nearly a full year to plan their trading activities, risk management, and operational schedules for 2026.
