## Key Points

- All lock-in dates marked as "Not Applicable"

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this listing is minimal on the overall market. With 174,622 shares representing a very small fraction of ICICI Bank's total outstanding equity, no significant price movement or liquidity change is expected. This is a routine administrative action to release bonus shares that were previously kept in abeyance, likely due to pending documentation or verification processes for specific shareholders. The absence of any lock-in period means these shares are immediately available for trading.
