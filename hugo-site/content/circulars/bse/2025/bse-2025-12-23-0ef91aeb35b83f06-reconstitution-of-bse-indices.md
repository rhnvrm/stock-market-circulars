## Compliance Requirements

- Index fund managers tracking these indices must rebalance portfolios to reflect the additions

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 23, 2025
- **Effective Date:** January 6, 2026 (at market open)
- **Reference Methodology Notice:** 20251029-21 dated October 29, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The addition of three stocks without any deletions indicates index expansion. This will result in buying pressure from index funds and ETFs that track these indices, particularly for passive funds managing BSE Allcap, LargeCap, and LargeMidCap portfolios.

**Stock-Specific Impact:**
- **Tata Motors (544569):** Inclusion in four indices including flagship BSE Industrials will increase passive fund ownership
- **Billionbrains Garage Ventures (544603):** Addition to BSE Financial Services and large-cap indices signals recognition of market capitalization growth
- **Lenskart Solutions (544600):** Entry into BSE Consumer Discretionary reflects sector classification and market cap threshold achievement

**Operational Impact:** Fund managers have approximately two weeks (from December 23, 2025 to January 6, 2026) to execute rebalancing trades. Expected increase in trading volumes for these three securities in the days leading up to the effective date.
