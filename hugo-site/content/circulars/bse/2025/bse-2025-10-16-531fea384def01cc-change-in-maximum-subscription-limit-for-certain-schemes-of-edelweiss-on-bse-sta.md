## Summary

Edelweiss Mutual Fund has announced immediate restrictions on subscriptions for 7 schemes due to the AMC's overseas investment headroom nearing the threshold set by SEBI on February 1, 2022. Effective October 16, 2025, new lump sum investments and switch-ins will be discontinued, while new SIP and STP transactions will be capped at maximum INR 5,000 per PAN per day. Existing systematic transactions remain unaffected.

- Switch-ins to the affected schemes also discontinued from the effective date
- New monthly SIP and STP transactions capped at maximum INR 5,000 per PAN per day
- Existing SIPs, STPs and other systematic transactions will continue without restriction
- Restriction based on transaction reporting date; transactions reported till October 15, 2025 before cut-off time not affected
- Decision driven by AMC's available headroom for overseas investment nearing threshold per mutual fund level limit set February 1, 2022
- Changes made pursuant to SEBI letter no. SEBI/HO/OW/IMD-II/DOF3/25095/2022 dated June 17, 2022

## Affected Schemes

1. Edelweiss ASEAN Equity Off-shore Fund

4. Edelweiss Emerging Markets Opportunities Equity Offshore Fund
5. Edelweiss Europe Dynamic Equity Offshore Fund
6. Edelweiss US Value Equity Off-shore Fund
7. Edelweiss MSCI India Domestic & World Healthcare 45 Index Fund

## Regulatory Context

- Restrictions implemented pursuant to SEBI's June 17, 2022 clarification on overseas investment limits
- SEBI had clarified that mutual funds can resume subscriptions and investments in overseas funds/securities up to headroom available without breaching overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022 at mutual fund level
- Notice cum addendum dated August 13, 2025 previously informed investors about subscription limits in few schemes

## Compliance Requirements

- Edelweiss Asset Management Limited to update relevant sections of SID/KIM of the designated schemes
- Notice-cum-addendum forms integral part of SID/KIM/SAI of the schemes
- New provisions override conflicting provisions in existing documents
- All other provisions of SID/KIM/SAI remain unchanged except as specifically modified

## Important Dates

- **October 16, 2025**: Effective date for discontinuation of new lump sum investments and switch-ins; new SIP/STP cap of INR 5,000 per PAN per day comes into effect
- **October 15, 2025**: Transactions reported before cut-off time on this date (including switches) not subject to limit restrictions
- **October 13, 2025**: Notice date
- **August 13, 2025**: Previous notice cum addendum on subscription limits issued
- **February 1, 2022**: Reference date for mutual fund level overseas investment limit threshold
- **June 17, 2022**: SEBI clarification letter date

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact (High):**
- Investors seeking new exposure to international markets through these 7 schemes will face significant restrictions
- Lump sum investment route completely closed for new investors and existing investors seeking to increase exposure
- New systematic investment route severely restricted to INR 5,000 per PAN per day, limiting portfolio diversification options
- Geographic diversification strategies (ASEAN, China, US, Europe, Emerging Markets) significantly constrained
- Sector-specific international exposure (technology, healthcare) limited for new investments

**Market Impact (Medium):**
- Reflects industry-wide challenge of overseas investment limits set by SEBI
- May drive investor interest toward other AMCs with available overseas investment headroom
- Indicates broader constraint on Indian mutual fund industry's ability to offer international diversification

**Operational Impact (Medium):**
- BSE StAR MF platform needs to implement transaction limits for affected schemes
- Distributors and intermediaries must communicate restrictions to clients
- Existing systematic transaction infrastructure remains operational, limiting operational disruption

**Positive Considerations:**
- Existing SIP/STP investors protected from disruption
- Transactions already in pipeline (reported till October 15, 2025) honored
- Transparent communication provides clarity to investors and distribution channels
