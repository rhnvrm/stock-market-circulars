title: Change in Scheme Name of Aditya Birla Sun Life US Treasury Bond ETFs Fund of
  Funds
---

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited has issued Addendum No. 55/2025 announcing name changes for two of its Fund of Funds (FOF) schemes investing in US Treasury Bond ETFs. The changes are in compliance with SEBI's Framework for launching FOF schemes with multiple underlying funds and will be effective from December 29, 2025. The schemes will add "Passive FOF" designation to their names while all other features and terms remain unchanged.

## Key Points

- Two US Treasury Bond ETFs Fund of Funds schemes are being renamed
- Name changes comply with SEBI Letter no. SEBI/HO/IMD/IMD-RAC-1/P/OW/2025/4102/1 dated February 6, 2025
- Changes implemented under revised Framework dated June 30, 2025
- All scheme features, terms, and conditions remain unchanged
- Only nomenclature is being modified to add "Passive FOF" designation
- Addendum forms integral part of SID and KIM documents

## Scheme Name Changes

1. **Aditya Birla Sun Life US Treasury 1-3 Year Bond ETFs Fund of Funds** renamed to **Aditya Birla Sun Life US Treasury 1-3 Year Bonds ETFs Passive FOF**

2. **Aditya Birla Sun Life US Treasury 3-10 Year Bond ETFs Fund of Funds** renamed to **Aditya Birla Sun Life US Treasury 3-10 Year Bonds ETFs Passive FOF**

## Regulatory Changes

The name changes are mandated by SEBI's Framework for launching Fund of Fund (FOF) schemes with multiple underlying funds, which requires clear identification of passive FOF schemes. The framework was initially issued on February 6, 2025, and revised on June 30, 2025. This ensures uniformity and clarity in nomenclature across the mutual fund industry for FOF schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC to update Scheme Information Documents (SID) and Key Information Memorandums (KIM) with revised scheme names
- All marketing materials and communications to reflect new scheme names from the effective date
- BSE StAR MF Platform to update scheme listings with new names
- Investors will receive updated documentation reflecting the name changes

## Important Dates

- **December 24, 2025**: Notice issued
- **December 29, 2025**: Effective date for scheme name changes

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Minimal to none. The name changes are purely administrative and do not affect investment objectives, portfolio composition, asset allocation, fee structure, or any other material terms of the schemes. Existing investors do not need to take any action.

**Operational Impact**: Limited to administrative updates in systems, documentation, and marketing materials. The schemes will continue to operate identically under their new names.

**Market Impact**: No market impact expected as this is a nomenclature change for regulatory compliance without any change to scheme fundamentals or operations.
