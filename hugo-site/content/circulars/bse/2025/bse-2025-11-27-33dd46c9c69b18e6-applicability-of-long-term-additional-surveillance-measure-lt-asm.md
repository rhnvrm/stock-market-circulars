## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective November 28, 2025. Two securities have been newly shortlisted under LT-ASM: Asston Pharmaceuticals Ltd and Mega Nirman and Industries Ltd. Additionally, two securities are moving out of the framework: Capital Trade Links Ltd and SVP Global Textiles Ltd, both due to their inclusion in the ESM Framework.

## Key Points

- 2 securities newly added to Long Term ASM Framework (Asston Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Mega Nirman and Industries Ltd)
- 2 securities moving out of LT-ASM Framework (Capital Trade Links Ltd, SVP Global Textiles Ltd)
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages within the framework
- No securities shortlisted for direct Stage IV LT-ASM
- Changes effective from November 28, 2025
- Securities exiting due to inclusion in ESM Framework

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework continues BSE's surveillance mechanism to monitor securities with unusual price movements or volatility. Securities under this framework face additional trading restrictions including:

- Trade-to-trade settlement
- 100% margin requirements
- Price bands and other surveillance measures
- Periodic review for stage progression or exit

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Update surveillance lists for affected securities
- Apply appropriate margin and settlement requirements
- Inform clients about LT-ASM status of these securities
- Ensure compliance with trade-to-trade requirements

**For Investors:**
- Securities under LT-ASM require 100% upfront margin
- No intraday trading allowed
- Delivery-based settlement mandatory
- Higher scrutiny on trading activity

## Important Dates

- **November 28, 2025**: Effective date for all LT-ASM framework changes

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Limited, as only 4 securities are affected in this update. The framework targets specific securities showing concerning price or volume patterns.

**Trading Impact:** 
- Asston Pharmaceuticals Ltd and Mega Nirman and Industries Ltd will face stricter trading conditions
- Capital Trade Links Ltd and SVP Global Textiles Ltd move to ESM framework, indicating continued surveillance under different mechanism
- Investors holding these securities should be aware of enhanced margin requirements and settlement restrictions

**Investor Impact:** Reduced liquidity and higher capital requirements for trading in newly included securities. Exit from LT-ASM does not mean removal from surveillance, as both exiting securities move to ESM framework.

**Part A - Newly Added to LT-ASM:**
1. Asston Pharmaceuticals Ltd (Scrip Code: 544445, ISIN: INE0SJX01015)
2. Mega Nirman and Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 539767, ISIN: INE216Q01010)
