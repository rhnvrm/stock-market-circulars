## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of Muthoottu Mini Financiers Limited effective November 6, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for redemption of its 10.5% debentures maturing on November 21, 2025. Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the no-dealings date.

## Key Points

- Record date for redemption: November 6, 2025
- No dealings permitted from: November 6, 2025
- Debenture maturity date: November 21, 2025
- Notice issued under reference: DR-750/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard corporate action notice for debenture redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified MMFL debentures from November 6, 2025
- Trading members are required to note this suspension and inform their clients holding these debentures
- Ensure all systems are updated to prevent inadvertent trading in suspended securities

## Important Dates

- **October 29, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 6, 2025**: Record date for redemption; no dealings commence
- **November 21, 2025**: Debenture maturity date

## Impact Assessment

The suspension affects holders of MMFL's 10.5% Non-Convertible Debentures issued in 2021. This is a routine corporate action with limited market-wide impact, primarily affecting debenture holders who will receive their redemption proceeds. Trading members must ensure compliance with the no-dealings restriction to avoid regulatory issues. The suspension ensures orderly redemption process and prevents trading during the record date determination period.
