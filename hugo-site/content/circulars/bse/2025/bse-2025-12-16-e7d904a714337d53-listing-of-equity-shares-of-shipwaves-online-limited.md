The shares are held in demat form, and distinctive numbers are provided for presentation purposes only.

## Key Points

- Total shares post-IPO: 14,14,95,000 equity shares
- All shares are fully paid and in demat form (except minor physical holdings)
- Multiple tranches with lock-in periods ranging from 1 to 3 years
- Lock-in periods begin from December 10-12, 2025
- Lock-in expiry dates range from December 30, 2026 to December 30, 2028

- Second largest tranche: 3,27,61,750 shares locked until December 30, 2026 (1-year lock-in)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard listing notification for an SME IPO.

## Compliance Requirements

- Shareholders must adhere to the specified lock-in periods for their respective tranches
- Locked-in shares cannot be traded until the lock-in expiry dates
- The company and shareholders must comply with SME listing requirements on BSE

## Important Dates

- **Lock-in Start Dates:** December 10-12, 2025 (various tranches)
- **1-Year Lock-in Expiry:** December 30, 2026 (applicable to most tranches)
- **2-Year Lock-in Expiry:** December 30, 2027 (2,82,99,000 shares)
- **3-Year Lock-in Expiry:** December 30, 2028 (4,69,60,000 shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal market-wide impact as this is a routine SME IPO listing. The listing adds liquidity to BSE's SME segment but affects only this specific company.

**Liquidity Impact:** Initial liquidity will be limited due to substantial lock-in commitments. Approximately 10,09,94,750 shares (71.4% of total) are subject to lock-in periods, with only 4,05,00,250 shares potentially available for immediate trading.

**Investor Impact:** Lock-in periods provide stability for new investors by restricting promoter and pre-IPO investor exits. The staggered lock-in expiry (1, 2, and 3 years) will gradually increase tradable float over time.
