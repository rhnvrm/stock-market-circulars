title: Change in Status of Company - Noble Polymers Limited Delisting Rescinded
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular regarding the change in status of Noble Polymers Limited (Scrip Code: 539200). Following an order from the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), the delisting of the company has been rescinded. The company's status will change from "Delisted" to "Suspended" with effect from November 13, 2025. As a result, certain provisions of SEBI's Delisting Regulations will no longer apply to the company.

## Key Points

- Noble Polymers Limited (Scrip Code: 539200) delisting has been rescinded by SAT order
- Status change from "Delisted" to "Suspended" effective November 13, 2025
- Regulation 24(1) and 24(2) of SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 are now not applicable
- Change implemented pursuant to Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal order
- Notice category: Company related (Equity segment)

## Regulatory Changes

The Securities Appellate Tribunal has issued an order rescinding the delisting of Noble Polymers Limited. This regulatory intervention reverses the previous delisting decision. Following this order, the provisions of Regulation 24(1) and Regulation 24(2) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 cease to be applicable to Noble Polymers Limited. These regulations typically govern post-delisting obligations and procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Noble Polymers Limited must comply with requirements applicable to suspended companies rather than delisted companies
- The company will no longer be subject to Regulation 24(1) and 24(2) of SEBI Delisting Regulations
- Market participants should note the change in company status for record-keeping and compliance purposes
- Investors and stakeholders should be aware that the company remains suspended (not actively trading) despite delisting being rescinded

## Important Dates

- **November 11, 2025**: Notice date and circular issuance
- **November 13, 2025**: Effective date for status change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"

## Impact Assessment

This circular represents a significant but uncommon event where a delisting decision is reversed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal. For Noble Polymers Limited, this means the company retains its listing status, albeit in suspended form, which may provide potential for future reactivation subject to compliance with listing requirements. The immediate market impact is limited as the company moves from delisted to suspended status (not actively trading in either case). However, this change is crucial for the company's legal status, potential future listing prospects, and shareholder rights. For the broader market, this demonstrates the appellate mechanism's oversight role in delisting decisions and may be relevant for other companies or investors involved in delisting proceedings.
