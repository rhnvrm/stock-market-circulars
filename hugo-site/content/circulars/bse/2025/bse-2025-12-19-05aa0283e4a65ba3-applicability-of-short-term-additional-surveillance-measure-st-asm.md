## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) is a preventive measure applied to securities showing unusual price movements or volatility. Securities under ST-ASM are subject to enhanced surveillance with stricter trading conditions including higher margins and trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised list of securities under ST-ASM
- Enhanced margin requirements will apply to securities in ST-ASM framework
- Trading in these securities may be subject to additional restrictions as per ST-ASM guidelines
- Brokers and investors should review positions in affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 22, 2025
- **Circular Date**: December 19, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities entering ST-ASM will face stricter trading conditions including higher margin requirements and potential Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD), which may reduce liquidity and increase trading costs.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or planning to trade in the 13 newly listed securities should be aware of increased margin requirements and potential price volatility monitoring.

**Market Operations**: The movement of 6 securities out of ST-ASM (with 3 moving to ESM and 2 to LT-ASM) indicates escalation of surveillance measures for those specific stocks, suggesting continued concerns about price behavior.
