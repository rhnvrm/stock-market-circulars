## Impact Assessment

**Corporate Impact**: The name change represents a significant rebranding initiative, likely indicating strategic alignment with IndusInd group entities. While the legal entity and CIN remain unchanged, the company will need to update all branding materials, signage, and customer-facing communications.

**Stakeholder Impact**: Policyholders, investors, and business partners should note that all existing policies, investments, and contractual obligations remain valid and unaffected. The name change is purely administrative and does not alter the company's financial position, operations, or obligations.

**Market Impact**: Minimal immediate market impact as this is a name change without operational restructuring. The company's stock ticker symbol may be updated by the exchange. Stakeholders should verify the company's latest status on the MCA portal at www.mca.gov.in/MCA21.

**Operational Continuity**: The two-year transitional period ensures smooth recognition and prevents confusion among stakeholders during the rebranding process.
