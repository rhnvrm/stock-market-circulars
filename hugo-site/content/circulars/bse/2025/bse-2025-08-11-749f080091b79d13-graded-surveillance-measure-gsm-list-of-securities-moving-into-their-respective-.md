  GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of 17 securities into their respective Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages. 11 securities are moving to GSM Stage I and 6 securities are moving to GSM Stage II, indicating increased regulatory oversight due to price volatility or other risk factors.

## Key Points

- 11 securities moved to GSM Stage I: Jainex Aamcol Ltd, Sashwat Technocrats Ltd, Munoth Capital Markets Ltd, Rishab Special Yarns Ltd, Artson Ltd, High Street Filatex Ltd, Vikalp Securities Ltd, Step Two Corporation Ltd, Omkar Pharmachem Ltd, Concrete Credit Ltd, and Adjia Technologies Ltd
- 6 securities moved to GSM Stage II: Mathew Easow Research Securities Ltd, MFS Intercorp Ltd, Harmony Capital Service Ltd, VK Global Industries Ltd, Adhata Global Ltd, and Shivamshree Businesses Ltd
- Securities may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM Framework or IBC Framework
- Changes are effective immediately

## Regulatory Changes

GSM framework implementation involves:
- Enhanced surveillance on identified securities
- Stricter monitoring of price movements and trading patterns
- Additional disclosure requirements for listed companies
- Increased margin requirements for trading these securities

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies must ensure compliance with enhanced disclosure norms
- Trading members must apply appropriate margin requirements
- Investors should be aware of additional restrictions on these securities
- Market participants must follow GSM-specific trading rules

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: August 11, 2025 (immediate implementation)

## Impact Assessment

- Potential stabilization of volatile price movements
- Increased compliance burden on affected companies
- Trading restrictions may impact short-term price discovery but improve market integrity
