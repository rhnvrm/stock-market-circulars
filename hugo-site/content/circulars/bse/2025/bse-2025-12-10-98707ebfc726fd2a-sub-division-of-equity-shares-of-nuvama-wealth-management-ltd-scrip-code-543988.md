title: 'Sub-Division of Equity Shares of Nuvama Wealth Management Ltd (Scrip Code:
  543988)'
---

## Summary

Nuvama Wealth Management Ltd (Scrip Code: 543988) has announced the sub-division of its equity shares, changing the face value from Rs.10/- per share to Rs.2/- per share. Each existing equity share of Rs.10/- will be split into five equity shares of Rs.2/- each. The record date for this corporate action is December 26, 2025, and the sub-divided shares will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Company: Nuvama Wealth Management Ltd
- Scrip Code: 543988
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Sub-division Ratio: 1:5 (One share of Rs.10/- split into Five shares of Rs.2/-)
- Segment: Equity - Dematerialised Securities Rolling Settlement
- Existing Face Value: Rs.10/- per share
- New Face Value: Rs.2/- per share
- Circular Reference: DR-785/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN No. INE531F01015 (for Rs.10/- paid up shares) will cease to be valid for transactions on the Exchange from December 26, 2025 onwards. A new ISIN number for Rs.2/- paid up shares will be assigned and communicated to the market through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date and ensure compliance with the new share structure
- All transactions on or after December 26, 2025 must be conducted using the new ISIN for Rs.2/- face value shares
- The existing ISIN INE531F01015 will not be accepted for trading from the effective date
- Members should update their systems and records to reflect the new share denomination

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 10, 2025
- **Record Date**: December 26, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 26, 2025
- **Old ISIN Validity**: Valid until December 25, 2025 (last day)
- **New ISIN Effective**: December 26, 2025 onwards

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by five times while proportionately reducing the face value. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors. The market capitalization remains unchanged, but the share price will adjust proportionately.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers, custodians, and depositories need to update their systems to reflect the new share structure. The change in ISIN requires technical updates to trading and settlement systems. Shareholders will see their holdings multiplied by five with a corresponding reduction in per-share price.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will automatically receive five shares for every one share held as on the record date. No action is required from shareholders as the sub-division will be processed automatically in demat accounts.
