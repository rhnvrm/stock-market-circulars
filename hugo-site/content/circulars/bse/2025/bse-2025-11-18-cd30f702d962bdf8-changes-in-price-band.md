## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 18, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 19, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Moderate - The revised price bands will limit daily price volatility in 23 securities, which may reduce speculative trading activity. Tighter bands (2%-5%) indicate heightened surveillance concerns and will significantly restrict price movements.

**Trading Impact**: Investors and traders in these securities will face stricter intraday price movement limits. Securities with 2% bands will have severely constrained trading ranges, potentially affecting liquidity.

**Investor Impact**: Long-term investors may not be significantly affected, but short-term traders and speculators will need to adjust strategies for these securities. The tighter bands suggest these securities are under enhanced surveillance, warranting caution.
