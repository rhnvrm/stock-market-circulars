## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Multiple securities across various sectors affected simultaneously, potentially reducing SLB market liquidity during shut periods.

**Operational Impact:** SLB participants need to monitor 25 different securities with varying shut periods over a two-week period, requiring careful position management and settlement planning.

**Investor Impact:** Beneficial owners during record dates will receive corporate action benefits. Short sellers and lenders must account for dividend obligations and position adjustments.

**Liquidity Impact:** Temporary reduction in SLB availability for affected securities during shut periods, particularly impactful for securities with longer shut periods (November 7-14 for some securities).
