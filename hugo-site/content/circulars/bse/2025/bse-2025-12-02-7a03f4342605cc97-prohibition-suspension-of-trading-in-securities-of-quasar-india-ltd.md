## Summary

BSE has prohibited/suspended trading in the securities of Quasar India Ltd (Scrip Code: 538452) with effect from December 3, 2025. This action is taken as an interim measure after the company failed to respond to a show cause notice and was found to be non-existent at its registered office address during an exchange site visit.

## Key Points

- Company: Quasar India Ltd (Scrip Code: 538452)
- Action: Trading prohibition/suspension
- Reason: Non-response to show cause notice and non-existence at registered office
- Verification: Exchange conducted site visit confirming company's absence
- Nature: Interim measure pending further investigation

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This circular implements existing enforcement provisions under BSE listing regulations for companies that fail to maintain communication and presence at their registered office.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all trading activities in Quasar India Ltd securities from December 3, 2025
- Investors are advised to take note of the suspension and cannot execute fresh trades in this security
- Company must respond to exchange notices and establish verifiable presence at registered office to potentially lift suspension

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 2, 2025
- **Effective Date of Suspension:** December 3, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - Complete halt in trading means existing investors cannot liquidate positions or new investors cannot enter. This creates liquidity freeze for shareholders.

**Investor Impact:** Severe for existing shareholders who are now locked into their positions until suspension is lifted. The non-existence at registered office raises serious concerns about company operations and investor protection.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their systems to block trades in scrip code 538452. This suspension may remain in effect indefinitely until the company addresses the compliance failures.
