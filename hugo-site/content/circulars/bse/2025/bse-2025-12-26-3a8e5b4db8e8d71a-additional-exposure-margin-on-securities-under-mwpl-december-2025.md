- Clearing members responsible for monitoring and reporting concentrated positions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Period**: December 2025
- **Circular Date**: December 26, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Higher margin requirements will increase the cost of carrying positions in these 14 securities, potentially reducing speculative activity and trading volumes. This may lead to lower liquidity in the affected stocks.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and clearing members need to adjust their margin collection and risk management processes. Investors and traders with existing positions may face margin calls requiring additional funds.

**Risk Management**: The additional exposure margin serves as a prudential measure to limit excessive concentration and reduce potential systemic risk from large positions in securities approaching market-wide position limits.
