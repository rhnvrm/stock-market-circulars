---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 26 securities effective August 21, 2025. The price bands range from 2% to 20%, indicating varying levels of surveillance measures applied to these stocks based on their trading patterns and risk profiles.

## Key Points

- 26 securities affected with price band revisions
- Effective date: August 21, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% (lowest) to 20% (highest)
- Most securities (11 out of 26) receive 2% price band
- Highest price bands of 20% applied to 3 securities: B.D. Industries, Mehul Colours, and Takyon Networks
- Notice issued under BSE surveillance department

## Regulatory Changes

Price band restrictions limit daily price movement of securities within specified percentages. Securities with higher price bands (10-20%) indicate greater surveillance concern, while lower bands (2-5%) represent standard monitoring levels.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands
- All trades must occur within the specified price band limits
- Clarifications can be sought at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **August 21, 2025**: Effective date for revised price bands
- **August 20, 2025**: Notice date

## Impact Assessment

The price band changes will limit daily volatility for these securities, potentially reducing speculative trading. Securities with higher price bands (20%) may face reduced liquidity due to stricter movement limits, while those with lower bands (2-5%) maintain relatively normal trading flexibility. Investors and traders should adjust their strategies accordingly for affected securities.
