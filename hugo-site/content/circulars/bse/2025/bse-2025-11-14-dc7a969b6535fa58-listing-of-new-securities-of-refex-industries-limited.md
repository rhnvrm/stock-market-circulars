## Summary

BSE has approved the listing of 75,75,000 equity shares of Refex Industries Limited (Scrip Code: 532884) issued to promoters on preferential basis pursuant to warrant conversion. Trading will commence on November 17, 2025. The shares are issued at Rs. 125 per share (face value Rs. 2 plus premium of Rs. 123) and will remain locked-in until June 15, 2027.

## Key Points

- 75,75,000 new equity shares of Rs. 2/- face value issued
- Issue price: Rs. 125 per share (Rs. 2 face value + Rs. 123 premium)
- Issued to promoters on preferential basis pursuant to warrant conversion
- Distribution numbers: 129280608 to 136855607
- ISIN: INE056I01025
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares
- Allotment date: October 3, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for preferential allotment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the listing of new securities
- All shares subject to lock-in restrictions until specified date
- Shares cannot be transferred or traded by promoters until lock-in expiry

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: October 3, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: November 17, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: June 15, 2027

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal immediate market impact as all 75.75 lakh shares are subject to lock-in until June 2027 and cannot be traded. The preferential issue to promoters increases promoter holding and demonstrates confidence in the company. No dilution concerns for existing public shareholders as shares were issued pursuant to approved warrant conversion. Trading volume unlikely to be affected as locked-in shares cannot participate in secondary market until 2027.
