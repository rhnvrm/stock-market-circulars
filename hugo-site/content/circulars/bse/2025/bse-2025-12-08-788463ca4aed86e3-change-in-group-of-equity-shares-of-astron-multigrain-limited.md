## Summary

BSE has announced that equity shares of ASTRON MULTIGRAIN LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544628) will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to Rolling segment (M Group) effective Monday, December 22, 2025. This follows the company's SME IPO and represents a transition to less restrictive trading arrangements.

## Key Points

- Company: ASTRON MULTIGRAIN LIMITED (SME IPO)
- Scrip Code: 544628
- Current Group: MT Group (Trade for Trade segment)
- New Group: M Group (Rolling segment)
- Effective Date: Monday, December 22, 2025
- Notice issued in continuation to Exchange Notice No. 20251205-56 dated December 05, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The equity shares will transition from Trade for Trade settlement to Rolling settlement, allowing for more flexible trading mechanisms. This change removes the restrictive Trade for Trade requirement where each transaction must be settled individually.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading Members should:
- Update their systems to reflect the group change from MT to M Group
- Adjust trading strategies for rolling settlement from December 22, 2025
- Contact Mr. Anurag Jain (Tel: 022-2272 8822) for further details or clarifications

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 08, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 22, 2025 (Monday)
- **Previous Notice**: December 05, 2025 (Notice No. 20251205-56)

## Impact Assessment

The transfer from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment is positive for market liquidity. Trade for Trade segments typically have restricted trading due to surveillance concerns or IPO requirements. Moving to the Rolling segment (M Group) indicates improved trading confidence and will allow for:
- Intraday trading opportunities
- Better price discovery
- Enhanced liquidity for investors
- Normal settlement cycles instead of compulsory delivery-based trading

This is a standard progression for SME IPO companies after meeting initial listing requirements and demonstrates regulatory confidence in the stock's trading behavior.
