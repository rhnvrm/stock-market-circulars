This is a routine listing announcement with minimal market-wide impact. The staggered lock-in structure suggests a controlled release of shares into the market over a three-year period, which may help prevent sudden supply shocks. Approximately 30% of the listed shares (17,98,000) are immediately tradable, while the remaining 70% will become available progressively over three years. This listing provides liquidity to existing shareholders while maintaining price stability through the lock-in mechanism.
