## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular follows existing framework for Rights Entitlements trading as outlined in previous notices dated March 05, 2020 (notice no. 20200305-21) and May 18, 2020 (notice no. 20200518-34).

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Inform all clients about the commencement of trading in REs
- Clearly communicate the ISIN of the RE to clients
- Include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases stating:
  - Purchase of REs only grants the right to participate in the ongoing Rights Issue by submitting application with requisite money, or to renounce the REs
  - REs that are neither subscribed nor renounced before Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished
- Ensure clients understand REs are not ordinary shares of the company
- Refer to notice nos. 20200305-21 and 20200518-34 for complete operational details

**For Investors:**
- REs must be held in dematerialized form for trading
- Must either subscribe with application money or renounce REs before November 21, 2025
- Failure to act will result in lapse of REs

## Important Dates

- **November 11, 2025**: Notice date
- **November 13, 2025**: RE trading commences; Rights Issue opens
- **November 17, 2025**: RE trading for renunciation closes
- **November 21, 2025**: Rights Issue closes; deadline for subscription/renunciation

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a company-specific corporate action affecting only existing shareholders of Darshan Orna Limited who hold rights entitlements.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal - Standard rights issue procedure following established BSE framework. Trading members need to ensure proper client communication and disclaimer processes are in place.

**Investor Impact:** Moderate for existing shareholders - Shareholders must take action within the specified timeframe (subscribe or renounce) to avoid lapse of their rights entitlements. The 5-day renunciation window (November 13-17) is shorter than the overall 9-day issue period (November 13-21), requiring timely decision-making for those considering selling their rights.
