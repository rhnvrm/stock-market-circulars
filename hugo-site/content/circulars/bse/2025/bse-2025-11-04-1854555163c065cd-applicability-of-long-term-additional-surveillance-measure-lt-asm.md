title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective November 06, 2025. Seven securities are being newly shortlisted under LT-ASM, including Flex Foods Ltd, IFB Agro Industries Ltd, JJ Finance Corporation Ltd, Kati Patang Lifestyle Ltd, Megastar Foods Ltd, MP Agro Industries Ltd, and TIERRA AGROTECH LIMITED. Additionally, TCM Ltd will continue in LT-ASM but will be moved to higher Stage II ASM. No securities are moving out of the framework or being placed directly in Stage IV.

## Key Points

- 7 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework
- TCM Ltd (Scrip Code: 524156, ISIN: INE034F01010) moved to ASM Stage II (higher stage)
- No securities moving to lower ASM stages
- No securities being placed directly in Stage IV
- No securities moving out of LT-ASM Framework
- Framework includes consolidated list of securities under various ASM stages

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework continues to be applied to securities meeting specific surveillance criteria. Securities under this framework are subject to enhanced monitoring and trading restrictions based on their ASM stage. Movement between stages occurs based on ongoing assessment of trading patterns, volatility, and other surveillance parameters.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised ASM stage classifications
- Enhanced due diligence required for securities under LT-ASM Framework
- Trading members should inform clients about securities under surveillance measures
- Price bands and other trading restrictions as per ASM stage requirements must be observed

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 06, 2025 - Implementation of LT-ASM changes for all affected securities

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities under LT-ASM face stricter trading conditions including higher margins, price bands, and reduced liquidity. TCM Ltd's movement to Stage II ASM indicates escalated surveillance concerns.

**Market Participants**: Investors holding positions in affected securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance measures and potential trading restrictions. Institutional investors may need to reassess positions due to increased compliance requirements.

**Liquidity Considerations**: Securities newly added to LT-ASM may experience reduced trading volumes and wider bid-ask spreads due to enhanced surveillance measures and margin requirements.
