  23, 2025
---

## Summary

Tuni Textile Mills Limited has extended the closing date of its ongoing Rights Issue from December 15, 2025 to December 23, 2025. The Board of Directors approved this extension in their meeting held on December 13, 2025 (1:00 PM to 1:15 PM) to provide shareholders additional opportunity to exercise their rights. The Rights Issue originally opened on November 24, 2025 as per the Letter of Offer dated November 11, 2025.

## Key Points

- Rights Issue closing date extended by 8 days from December 15, 2025 to December 23, 2025
- Extension approved by Board of Directors on December 13, 2025
- Rights Issue opened on November 24, 2025 as originally scheduled
- Last date for submission of Common Application Form (CAF) is now December 23, 2025
- No changes to Letter of Offer (LOF) or CAF except closing date and subsequent timeline
- Scrip Code: 531411

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a procedural extension of an ongoing Rights Issue within the company's authority to provide shareholders more time to participate.

## Compliance Requirements

- Equity shareholders entitled to the Rights Issue should note the revised Issue Closing Date of December 23, 2025
- Shareholders must submit duly filled Common Application Form (CAF) along with payment by December 23, 2025
- Off-market transfer of Rights entitlements must be completed by December 22, 2025

## Important Dates

**Revised Issue Schedule:**

- **Issue Opening Date:** Monday, November 24, 2025
- **Last Date for On-Market Renunciation:** Wednesday, December 03, 2025
- **Last Date for Off-Market Transfer:** Monday, December 22, 2025
- **Issue Closing Date:** Tuesday, December 23, 2025 (Extended)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium - The extension is primarily administrative and provides existing shareholders additional time to participate in the Rights Issue. This typically indicates either lower-than-expected subscription or company's intent to maximize participation.

**Shareholder Impact:** Positive for existing shareholders who may need additional time to arrange funds or make investment decisions. The 8-day extension provides flexibility without materially altering the Rights Issue structure.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal - All post-issue activities (allotment, credit, listing) are proportionally delayed by approximately one week, with listing now expected around December 29, 2025 instead of earlier. The company maintains that there are no changes to the Letter of Offer or Common Application Form except for the timeline adjustments.
