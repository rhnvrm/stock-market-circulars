The record date is set for November 7, 2025, and trading will occur on an ex-rights basis from the same date under settlement number DR-751/2025-2026.

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: November 7, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The rights issue will result in capital dilution for non-participating shareholders. The 7:3 rights ratio represents a significant expansion of share capital (233% increase for fully subscribed issue).

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders must decide whether to subscribe to maintain their ownership percentage. The staggered payment structure (Rs.2.50 upfront, Rs.7.50 on call) reduces immediate capital requirement.

**Trading Impact**: Shares will trade ex-rights from November 7, 2025, which typically results in price adjustment to reflect the rights offering value. Trading members must ensure proper execution of ex-rights transactions.
