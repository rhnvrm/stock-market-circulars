## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects trading members with short positions in these scrips who must buy shares at potentially higher auction prices.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers with clients having delivery failures must arrange funds for auction purchases or face penalties. Clients may face higher costs if shares are purchased at auction premiums.

**Liquidity Impact:** May create temporary price pressure on affected securities, particularly those with large auction quantities like VIKAS LIFECARE, Sagility, and NEW LIGHT INDIA.

**Sectoral Spread:** Broad-based across sectors including power (Adani Power, NHPC), automobiles (Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland), banking (SBI), infrastructure, textiles, and others - indicating widespread settlement issues rather than sector-specific problems.
