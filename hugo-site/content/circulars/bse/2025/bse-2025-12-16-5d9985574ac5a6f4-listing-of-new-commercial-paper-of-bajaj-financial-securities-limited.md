## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine debt instrument listing affecting primarily institutional investors and debt market participants. The high credit ratings (A1+) indicate strong creditworthiness of Bajaj Financial Securities Limited. The short tenure (16 days for Series 1, 91 days for Series 2) suggests these are money market instruments for short-term funding. No impact expected on equity markets or retail investors.
