## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium - The extension provides existing shareholders additional time to participate in the Rights Issue, potentially increasing subscription rates. This is a shareholder-friendly move that may improve participation.

**Shareholder Impact:** Positive - Shareholders gain an additional week to arrange funds and exercise their rights, reducing the risk of missing the deadline. This is particularly beneficial for retail shareholders who may need more time for decision-making.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal - The 7-day extension shifts all post-issue activities (allotment, credit, listing) by corresponding dates but does not materially change the overall process. The company and registrar will need to accommodate the extended timeline.

**Timeline Impact:** All subsequent milestones (basis of allotment, allotment date, credit date, and listing date) have been shifted proportionally to accommodate the extended closing date.
