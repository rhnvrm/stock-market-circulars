title: Clarification on Digital Accessibility Requirements for Regulated Entities
  under Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued clarifications on digital accessibility requirements for all Regulated Entities (REs) under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. The circular extends the compliance deadline, requiring REs to submit their digital accessibility readiness status by March 31, 2026, instead of appointing accessibility auditors by December 14, 2025. The circular also establishes an "Accessibility" complaint category in SCORES for investors to report accessibility-related issues on digital platforms.

## Key Points

- "Investors' Right to have digital accessibility" will be included in respective Investor Charters for various regulated entities
- REs must submit status of readiness and compliance for each digital platform by March 31, 2026
- Stock Brokers and Depository Participants report to Stock Exchanges/Depositories
- Investment Advisors and Research Analysts report to BSE Ltd.
- Other regulated entities including AIFs, Mutual Funds, Credit Rating Agencies, and Clearing Corporations report directly to SEBI at digital_acc@sebi.gov.in
- Investors can lodge accessibility complaints through SCORES platform under "Accessibility" category
- REs must remediate accessibility issues for complaint closure
- Periodic accessibility audits mandatory through certified accessibility professionals

## Regulatory Changes

This circular modifies and clarifies three previous SEBI circulars issued on digital accessibility:
