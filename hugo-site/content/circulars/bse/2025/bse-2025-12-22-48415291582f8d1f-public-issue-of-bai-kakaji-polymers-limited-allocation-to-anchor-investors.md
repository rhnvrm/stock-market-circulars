- Allocation to anchor investors provides price discovery and indicates institutional demand for the IPO
- This is a standard pre-IPO process as per SEBI regulations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard IPO process notification.

## Compliance Requirements

Successful anchor allocation often provides confidence to retail and other institutional investors during the public offering period.
