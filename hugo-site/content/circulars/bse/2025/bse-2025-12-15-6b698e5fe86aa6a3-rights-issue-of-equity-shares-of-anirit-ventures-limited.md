## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will see significant dilution if they do not participate in the rights issue, given the generous 2:1 ratio. Those who subscribe will maintain their proportional ownership while investing additional capital.

**Market Impact**: The ex-rights trading from December 18, 2025 will result in theoretical price adjustment to reflect the rights entitlement. Trading members must ensure proper handling of trades on ex-rights basis.

**Company Impact**: The rights issue will infuse equity capital into Anirit Ventures Limited, with the premium component (Rs. 23 per share) potentially strengthening the company's reserves. The installment payment structure may ease the financial burden on shareholders while providing staged capital inflow to the company.
