## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects liquidity in the SLB segment for 16 securities across multiple dates in November. Participants with open positions must plan exits or adjustments before shut periods.

**Operational Impact**: SLB desks and risk management teams need to monitor positions across multiple securities and dates. The staggered schedule from November 6-21 requires continuous attention to avoid positions being locked during shut periods.

**Investor Impact**: Beneficial owners via SLB arrangements need to understand their entitlement status for corporate actions. Lenders may recall securities to capture dividend benefits, while borrowers need to account for dividend obligations.

**Liquidity Impact**: Temporary reduction in SLB availability for these securities during shut periods, potentially affecting short-selling strategies and hedging activities in the underlying cash market.
