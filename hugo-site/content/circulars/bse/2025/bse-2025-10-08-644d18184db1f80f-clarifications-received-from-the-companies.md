## Compliance Requirements

- Companies responded to BSE surveillance queries as required under Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015
- Companies must continue to disclose all material and price-sensitive information to stock exchanges as and when required
- Ongoing obligation to maintain transparency in market communications

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a standard regulatory compliance exercise where exchanges seek clarification on unusual price or volume movements. The companies' responses indicate no undisclosed material events, suggesting the price movements were driven by general market sentiment and trading activity rather than company-specific developments. Investors should note that no new material information was disclosed that would warrant trading decisions.
