title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective September 10, 2025. The circular provides comprehensive lists of securities being newly shortlisted, moved between surveillance stages, and removed from the framework.

## Key Points

- 10 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework Stage I
- 3 securities moved to higher ASM Stage II (Sunshine Capital, Transpact Enterprises, Vintron Informatics)
- 1 security (S.A.L. Steel Ltd) moved out of LT-ASM Framework due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- No securities moved to lower ASM stages or direct Stage IV
- Changes effective from September 10, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of updated Long Term ASM framework with revised security classifications and surveillance levels based on risk assessment criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- Securities in LT-ASM framework subject to enhanced surveillance measures
- Higher ASM stages involve stricter trading restrictions and monitoring
- Market participants must comply with applicable surveillance conditions for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **September 10, 2025**: Effective date for all LT-ASM framework changes

## Impact Assessment

The surveillance measures will impact trading in the affected securities through enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions. Securities moved to higher ASM stages will face stricter surveillance conditions, while those moved out may see reduced restrictions depending on their new classification framework.
