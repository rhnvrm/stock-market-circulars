The suspension is implemented ahead of the record date of November 8, 2025, which has been fixed for partial redemption due to buyback at investor request and payment of interest on the 8.80% debentures maturing December 19, 2025.

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of this specific debenture series (JMFCSL-8.80%-19-12-25-PVT). The suspension is temporary and procedural, affecting only the debt segment. Trading members holding positions in these debentures need to ensure compliance with the no-dealings restriction. Investors seeking to exit positions must do so before November 7, 2025. The partial redemption indicates some debenture holders will receive principal repayment along with interest, reducing the outstanding issue size.
