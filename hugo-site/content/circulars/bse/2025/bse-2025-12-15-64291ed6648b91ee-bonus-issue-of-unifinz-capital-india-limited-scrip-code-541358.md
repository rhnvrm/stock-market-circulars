**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 4 additional shares for every 1 share held as on the record date. While the number of shares increases 5x, the proportional ownership remains unchanged. The market price per share is expected to adjust proportionally (approximately 1/5th of pre-bonus price).

**Market Impact**: The bonus issue will increase the total outstanding shares significantly, improving liquidity. The lower post-bonus share price may make the stock more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: The company has received all necessary approvals and is following SEBI's prescribed timeline for credit of bonus shares to ensure smooth implementation of the corporate action.
