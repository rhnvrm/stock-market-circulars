title: Suspension of Trading in Debentures of ECL Finance Limited
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in non-convertible debentures of ECL Finance Limited (ISIN: INE804I073Z6, Scrip Code: 958411) effective November 4, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing the record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the specified date.

## Key Points

- ECL Finance Limited's 10.75% debentures maturing November 19, 2025 will cease trading
- ISIN: INE804I073Z6, BSE Scrip Code: 958411
- Record date set for November 4, 2025
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Trading members explicitly advised not to deal in these debentures
- Circular reference: DR-749/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action process where trading is suspended ahead of redemption to establish eligibility for final interest payment and principal repayment.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from November 4, 2025 onwards
- **Trading Members**: Required to take note of the suspension and communicate to clients holding or interested in these securities
- **Investors**: Cannot trade these debentures on the exchange from the no-dealings date

## Important Dates

- **October 29, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 4, 2025**: Record date for interest payment and redemption
- **November 4, 2025**: No dealings period begins (trading suspension effective)
- **November 19, 2025**: Debenture maturity date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of this specific debenture series. No broader market implications as this is a scheduled redemption of a privately placed debenture.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will receive final interest payment and principal redemption. Liquidity is eliminated from the no-dealings date, preventing exit before redemption.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update systems to block trades in this security and inform clients holding positions. Standard corporate action processing applies for interest and redemption payments to eligible holders as of record date.
