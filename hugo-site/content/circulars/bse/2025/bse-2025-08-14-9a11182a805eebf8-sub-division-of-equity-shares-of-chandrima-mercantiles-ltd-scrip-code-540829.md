## Impact Assessment

This is a standard corporate action that will increase the number of shares outstanding by a factor of 10 while reducing the face value proportionally. The sub-division typically aims to improve liquidity and make shares more accessible to retail investors. Trading members and investors need to be aware of the ISIN change to ensure smooth trading operations.
