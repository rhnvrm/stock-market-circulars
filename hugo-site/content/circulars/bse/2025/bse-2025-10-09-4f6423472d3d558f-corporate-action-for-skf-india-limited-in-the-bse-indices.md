## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - This demerger represents a significant corporate restructuring that will create two separate listed entities from one existing company. The 1:1 share allocation ratio means shareholders will hold positions in both entities post-demerger.

**Index Impact**: The addition of SKF India (Industrial) Limited to 11 BSE indices (BSE 500, BSE Capital Goods, BSE Smallcap, BSE Allcap, BSE Industrials, BSE Smallcap Select Index, BSE 250 Smallcap Index, BSE 400 MidSmallcap Index, BSE 1000, BSE 1000 Multicap Equal Size Weighted 25%, and BSE MidSmallcap) at zero price without divisor adjustment ensures index continuity while accommodating the corporate action.

**Trading Impact**: The Special Pre-Open Session on October 15, 2025, is crucial for establishing the post-demerger price of SKF India Limited, allowing market forces to determine fair value after the business separation.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders will need to track two separate entities going forward, with potential tax implications and portfolio rebalancing considerations. The exact listing date for the new entity remains to be announced, which may create temporary uncertainty regarding liquidity and valuation of the demerged entity.
