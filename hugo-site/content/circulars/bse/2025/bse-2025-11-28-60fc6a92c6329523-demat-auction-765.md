## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard operational notice for demat auction settlement.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members with short positions in the listed securities must participate in the demat auction to fulfill settlement obligations

- Settlement must be completed as per BSE clearing and settlement regulations

## Important Dates

- Settlement Date: November 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational circular with limited market impact. The demat auction process is a standard mechanism to ensure settlement of trades where sellers have failed to deliver securities. The impact is localized to:

- Members with outstanding delivery obligations in the listed scrips
- Potential minor price volatility in the affected securities during the auction period
- No broader market or regulatory implications

The quantities involved are relatively small for most securities, indicating normal settlement operations rather than systemic issues.
