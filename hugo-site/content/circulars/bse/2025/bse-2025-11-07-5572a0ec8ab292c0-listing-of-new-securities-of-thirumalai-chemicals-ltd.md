- **Trading Commencement**: November 10, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: May 15, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The preferential allotment represents a significant increase in share capital and will impact the company's equity base. The lock-in period until May 2026 means these shares will not be available for trading for approximately 6 months from listing date, limiting immediate supply.

**Shareholder Impact**: The issuance to non-promoters will result in dilution for existing shareholders. However, the capital raised may support the company's growth plans or financial requirements.

**Trading Impact**: Limited immediate trading impact due to lock-in restrictions. Post lock-in expiry in May 2026, increased float may impact liquidity and price dynamics.
