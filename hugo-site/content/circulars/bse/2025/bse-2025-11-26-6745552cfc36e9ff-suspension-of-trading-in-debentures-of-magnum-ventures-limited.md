BSE has announced the suspension of trading in non-convertible debentures of MAGNUM VENTURES LIMITED (ISIN: INE387I07013, Code: 975493) effective November 28, 2025.

## Important Dates

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|

| November 28, 2025 | Trading suspension effective (no dealings from this date) |
| November 29, 2025 | Record date for early redemption and interest payment |

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Trading suspension affects only holders of this specific debenture series. The suspension is temporary and tied to the early redemption corporate action.

**Investor Impact:** Medium to High for debenture holders - Early redemption provides liquidity to investors ahead of maturity (August 2027), though trading opportunity is eliminated from November 28. Holders on record date will receive principal redemption and accrued interest.

**Operational Impact:** Low - Standard corporate action procedure requiring trading desk configuration updates to block trading in the specified ISIN.
