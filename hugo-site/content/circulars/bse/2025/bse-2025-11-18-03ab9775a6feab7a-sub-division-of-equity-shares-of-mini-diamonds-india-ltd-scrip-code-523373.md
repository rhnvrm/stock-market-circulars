title: 'Sub-Division of Equity Shares of Mini Diamonds India Ltd (Scrip Code: 523373)'
---

## Summary

Mini Diamonds India Ltd (Scrip Code: 523373) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares, converting each existing equity share of face value Rs.10/- into five equity shares of face value Rs.2/- each. The record date for this corporate action has been fixed as December 2, 2025. The existing ISIN (INE281E01010) for Rs.10/- shares will cease to be valid for exchange transactions from December 2, 2025, and a new ISIN for Rs.2/- shares will be communicated separately.

## Key Points

- Company: Mini Diamonds India Ltd (Scrip Code: 523373)
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Sub-division Ratio: 1:5 (One share of Rs.10/- split into Five shares of Rs.2/-)
- Segment: Equity - Dematerialised Securities (Rolling Settlement)
- Notice Number: 20251118-57
- Notice Date: November 18, 2025
- Issued by: Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance & Operations

## Regulatory Changes

- The existing ISIN Number INE281E01010 (for Rs.10/- paid-up shares) will not be valid for transactions executed on the Exchange on or after December 2, 2025
- A new ISIN Number for Rs.2/- paid-up shares will be assigned and communicated to the market through a separate notice
- All dematerialised holdings will be automatically adjusted to reflect the new share denomination and quantity

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must note the record date and ensure all transactions from December 2, 2025 onwards reflect the new face value of Rs.2/-
- Members should not accept or process any trades using the old ISIN (INE281E01010) on or after the effective date
- Depositories and depository participants will credit the additional shares to shareholders' demat accounts based on their holdings as of the record date
- Market participants should await the separate notice communicating the new ISIN before processing trades post-subdivision

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: December 2, 2025 - Shareholders on this date will be eligible for the sub-division
- **Effective Date**: December 2, 2025 - New paid-up value of Rs.2/- becomes effective
- **Old ISIN Invalid From**: December 2, 2025 - ISIN INE281E01010 will not be valid for exchange transactions
- **Notice Date**: November 18, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the face value proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors. The market price per share is expected to adjust proportionately (approximately 1/5th of pre-split price).

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 4 additional shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. The total value of their holdings remains unchanged, but the number of shares increases. This is a neutral corporate action from a valuation perspective.

**Trading Impact**: Trading members must ensure systems are updated to reflect the new ISIN and face value from December 2, 2025. There may be temporary confusion during the transition period. The new ISIN announcement is critical for seamless trading post-subdivision.

**Operational Impact**: Depositories and RTAs will need to process the subdivision and credit additional shares to all eligible shareholders. This is a standard corporate action with established processes.
