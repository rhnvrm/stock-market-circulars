The pari-passu ranking ensures equal rights for new shareholders alongside existing shareholders in terms of dividends, voting, and other corporate benefits.

**Trading Impact**: Market participants can trade these securities starting December 29, 2025, which may influence trading volumes and price discovery in the stock.
