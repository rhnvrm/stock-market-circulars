title: Merger of Aditya Birla Sun Life Interval Income Scheme with CRISIL-IBX Financial
  Services Debt Index Fund on BSE StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

BSE has notified the merger of Aditya Birla Sun Life (ABSL) Interval Income Quarterly Series 1 scheme into Aditya Birla Sun Life CRISIL-IBX Financial Services 3 to 6 Months Debt Index Fund. The merger involves three plan variants: Regular IDCW Payout, Regular Growth, and Direct Growth plans, with corresponding ISINs being consolidated into the surviving debt index fund scheme.

## Key Points

- Three schemes of ABSL Interval Income Quarterly Series 1 are being merged into ABSL CRISIL-IBX Financial Services Debt Index Fund
- Merger affects both Regular and Direct plan variants with IDCW Payout and Growth options
- Merging schemes: INF209K01HO3 (Regular IDCW Payout), INF209K01HN5 (Regular Growth), INF209K01YQ3 (Direct Growth)
- Surviving schemes: INF209KC1480 (Regular IDCW Payout), INF209KC1472 (Regular Growth), INF209KC1456 (Direct Growth)
- Transition from interval fund structure to debt index fund structure

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular notifies a scheme merger in compliance with SEBI mutual fund regulations governing scheme consolidation and rationalization.

## Compliance Requirements

- BSE StAR MF platform to update scheme master data reflecting the merger
- Unitholders of merging schemes will automatically receive units of the corresponding surviving scheme
- Fund house to ensure seamless transition of investor holdings from merging to surviving ISINs
- Distributors and platforms to update scheme codes and transaction systems

## Important Dates

Circular issued: October 28, 2025

Specific merger effective date not mentioned in the circular content provided.

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact:** Existing unitholders of ABSL Interval Income Quarterly Series 1 will see their investments automatically transferred to the ABSL CRISIL-IBX Financial Services Debt Index Fund. The investment strategy changes from an interval fund (with periodic liquidity windows) to a debt index fund (tracking a specific debt index), which may affect liquidity profile and investment characteristics.

**Operational Impact:** Mutual fund distributors, RIAs, and trading platforms need to update their systems to reflect the new ISINs. Existing SIPs, STPs, and SWPs linked to merging schemes will need to be mapped to surviving scheme codes.

**Market Impact:** Limited broader market impact as this is a scheme-specific consolidation within one AMC's product suite. Affects only specific unitholders of the interval income scheme.
