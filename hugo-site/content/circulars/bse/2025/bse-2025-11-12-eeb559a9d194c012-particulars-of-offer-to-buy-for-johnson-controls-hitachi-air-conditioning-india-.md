## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - This is a significant takeover offer for JCHAC involving up to 70 lakh shares (approximately 14.66% if total shares are around 4.77 crore based on typical shareholding patterns). The offer price of Rs. 1762.54 per share represents a substantial transaction value of approximately Rs. 1,234 crores.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure systems and processes are ready for OTB module operations. Members need to verify investor eligibility (demat holdings), ensure UCC registration compliance, and coordinate with custodians for institutional clients. The 14-day offer window requires dedicated resource allocation for processing bids, give-up/take-up transactions, and client coordination.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders of JCHAC have a two-week window to tender their shares at the specified price. This represents an exit opportunity for investors seeking liquidity.

**Contact Support**: BSE has provided dedicated contacts for technical support (Trading Operations: 022-22728005, user.trdops@bseindia.com) and specific points of contact for OTB module queries (Sandeep Pujari, Rushi Bhoir, Hormazdiar Mobedji) and listing sales (Mangesh Tayde, Rinkesh Gaikwad).
