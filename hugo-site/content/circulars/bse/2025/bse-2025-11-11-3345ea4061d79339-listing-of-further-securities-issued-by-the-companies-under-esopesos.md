title: Listing of Further Securities Issued Under ESOP/ESOS - November 12, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the listing and admission for trading of further securities issued by nine companies under their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). These shares will be available for trading from Wednesday, November 12, 2025. The circular covers companies across banking, technology, real estate, and consumer sectors, with no lock-in restrictions on any of the listed shares.

## Key Points

- Nine companies listing additional equity shares from ESOP/ESOS exercise
- Total shares being listed: 1,443,261 shares across all companies
- Effective trading date: November 12, 2025
- All shares listed with no lock-in period (NA for all entries)
- Companies span multiple sectors: banking, healthcare, technology, real estate, fashion, and manufacturing
- Largest issuance: Newgen Software Technologies Limited (639,000 shares)
- Notable banking additions: ICICI Bank (25,701 shares) and Federal Bank (282,444 shares)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the additional shares in circulation
- Market participants should note the new distinctive number ranges for each company's shares
- No special compliance actions required as shares have no lock-in restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 11, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: November 12, 2025 (Wednesday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (no lock-in period for any shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The share quantities being listed represent routine ESOP exercises and are relatively small compared to the total outstanding shares of these companies. The largest single issuance is 639,000 shares by Newgen Software, which is unlikely to cause significant dilution or price pressure.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in free float for each company. No lock-in restrictions mean shares are immediately tradeable, but volumes are not material enough to affect overall market liquidity.

**Corporate Governance**: Positive signal of companies honoring employee compensation through stock options, maintaining standard corporate practices.
