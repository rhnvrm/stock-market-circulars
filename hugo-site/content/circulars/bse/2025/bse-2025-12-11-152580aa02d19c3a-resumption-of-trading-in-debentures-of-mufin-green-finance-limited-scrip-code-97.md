title: Resumption of Trading in Debentures of MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED (Scrip Code
  977318)
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the resumption of trading in debentures of MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED (Scrip Code 977318) effective December 12, 2025. This follows a clarification from the company that the record date of December 11, 2025, previously notified, is only for the purpose of interest payment and not for redemption of debentures. The earlier notice dated December 9, 2025, had indicated the record date was for both interest payment and redemption, which led to trading restrictions.

## Key Points

- Trading in MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED debentures (Scrip Code 977318) to resume from December 12, 2025
- Company clarified that record date of December 11, 2025 is only for interest payment, not redemption
- This supersedes Exchange Notice No. 20251209-69 dated December 9, 2025
- Reference number: DR-776/2025-2026
- Notice issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a correction and clarification of previously communicated corporate action details.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are requested to note the resumption of trading in the specified debentures
- Normal trading procedures to apply from December 12, 2025 onwards
- Members should update their systems to reflect the corrected record date purpose

## Important Dates

- **December 9, 2025**: Original notice issued (Exchange Notice No. 20251209-69)
- **December 11, 2025**: Record date for interest payment only (not redemption)
- **December 11, 2025**: Current clarification notice issued (Notice No 20251211-5)
- **December 12, 2025**: Trading resumption date for debentures

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The resumption of trading restores liquidity for holders of MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED debentures. The one-day trading suspension would have limited impact on the broader debt market.

**Operational Impact**: The clarification prevents confusion among market participants regarding the purpose of the record date and ensures proper trading operations. Debenture holders can now trade their securities as normal from December 12, 2025, while still being eligible for interest payment if holding on the record date.
