## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine corporate action that reflects employee compensation and retention strategies. The quantities being listed represent a small fraction of the total outstanding shares for each company.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible increase in tradable float across the 17 companies. The largest single issuance (IDFC First Bank with 796,222 shares) represents minimal dilution.

**Investor Impact:** No immediate impact on existing shareholders. These shares were already part of authorized capital and their conversion/exercise was anticipated. No lock-in restrictions allow immediate trading participation.

**Companies Affected:** Max India, Aditya Birla Capital, ArisInfra Solutions, BlackBuck, Carborundum Universal, CG Power, DCB Bank, Emcure Pharmaceuticals, Federal Bank, IDFC First Bank, Infosys, KFin Technologies, Lodha Developers, Sai Life Sciences, Sudarshan Chemical, The Phoenix Mills, and Waaree Renewable Technologies.
