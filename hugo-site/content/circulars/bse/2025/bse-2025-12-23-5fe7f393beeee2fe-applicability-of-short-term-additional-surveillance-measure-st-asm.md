## Compliance Requirements

- Different treatment for SME scrips (marked @) and regular scrips

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 24, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects trading liquidity and conditions for 18 securities across mainboard and SME segments. Inclusion in ST-ASM typically results in higher margins, potential price bands, and reduced liquidity.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will face enhanced surveillance measures including higher margin requirements and potential trading restrictions.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to update systems and risk management frameworks to account for changed surveillance status of affected securities.
