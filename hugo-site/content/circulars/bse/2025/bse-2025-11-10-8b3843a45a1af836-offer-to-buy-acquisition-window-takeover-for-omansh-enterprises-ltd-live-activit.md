## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a specific corporate action affecting only OMANSH ENTERPRISES LTD shareholders. The offer size of 44.03 lakh shares at Rs. 2.00 per share (matching face value) represents a relatively small transaction value. The takeover is conducted through BSE's established Acquisition Window mechanism.

**Operational Impact**: Medium for Trading Members and Custodians who have clients holding OMANSH shares, as they need to facilitate bidding through iBBS/RTRMS platforms during the 14-day offer period. Member firms must ensure proper UCC registration and coordinate with clients for participation.

**Investor Categories Eligible**: FII, FI, Mutual Fund, Insurance Companies, Other QIBs, Other NIBs, Company, and Individual investors can participate through their Trading Members.

**Contact Support**: BSE has provided comprehensive contact details for technical support (Trading Operations: 022-22728005, user.trdops@bseindia.com) and OTB-specific queries (Sandeep Pujari, Rushi Bhoir, Hormazdiar Mobedji, Mangesh Tayde, Rinkesh Gaikwad with direct phone numbers and emails).
