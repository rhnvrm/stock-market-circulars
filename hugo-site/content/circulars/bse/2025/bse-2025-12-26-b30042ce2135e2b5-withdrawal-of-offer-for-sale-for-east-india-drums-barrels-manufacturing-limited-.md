---

## Summary

East India Drums & Barrels Manufacturing Limited (Scrip Code: 523874) has withdrawn its Offer for Sale (OFS) notice dated 26th December 2025. The withdrawal is due to technical system issues encountered in transferring securities to the clearing broker/selling broker. The company will not be offering promoter shares as originally intended in the OFS notice.

## Key Points

- OFS originally scheduled for 26th December 2025 has been withdrawn
- Withdrawal reason: Technical system issues in security transfer process to clearing/selling brokers
- Promoter shares will not be offered for sale as planned
- Company has requested BSE to withdraw the OFS notice
- Scrip Code: 523874
- Notice signed by Mayuri Choudhary, Company Secretary cum Compliance Officer

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a procedural withdrawal of a previously announced OFS.

## Compliance Requirements

- BSE to process the withdrawal of the OFS notice
- Investors to be informed that the planned OFS will not proceed as scheduled
- Company may need to reissue OFS notice once technical issues are resolved

## Important Dates

- **26th December 2025**: Original OFS date (now withdrawn)
- **26th December 2025**: Withdrawal notice issued
- Future OFS date: To be announced after resolution of technical issues

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Investors who planned to participate in the OFS will need to await a rescheduled offering. The withdrawal is procedural and technical in nature, not related to company fundamentals or promoter intent changes.

**Operational Impact**: The company faces technical challenges in the securities transfer process that prevented the OFS from proceeding. This postponement may affect promoter liquidity plans and investor expectations.

**Investor Impact**: Potential buyers planning to acquire shares through the OFS will need to wait for the rescheduled offering. No immediate trading impact expected as this relates to a planned secondary market transaction.
