## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed about the new securities availability for trading
- Lock-in period compliance required for specified share lots
- Shares must be traded according to BSE regulations

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: June 13, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: August 22, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry (Lot 1)**: March 31, 2026 (for 5,264,090 shares)
- **Lock-in Expiry (Lot 2)**: March 31, 2027 (for 606,060 shares)

## Impact Assessment

The listing increases REGENCY FINCORP LIMITED's share capital significantly. However, the substantial lock-in periods (majority shares locked until March 2026, remainder until March 2027) will limit immediate trading volume and liquidity impact. The preferential allotment structure suggests strategic capital raising rather than broad market dilution.
