## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Members with short positions in the listed scrips must participate in the auction or arrange delivery
- Settlement must be completed as per BSE auction guidelines
- Members responsible for delivery failures will bear the auction differential costs
- All auction procedures must follow SEBI and BSE regulations for securities settlement

## Important Dates

- **Auction Date**: December 29, 2025
- **Settlement No.**: 785

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The auction involves 93 scrips indicating delivery failures across multiple securities. While most quantities are small (under 1,000 shares), some scrips like ARC Finance (86,154), Indian Railway Finance (20,000), and Wardwizard Innovations (21,006) show significant delivery shortfalls.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and members with short positions in these scrips will need to participate in the auction, potentially at prices higher than market rates. The auction differential will be borne by the defaulting members.

**Investor Impact**: Limited direct impact on retail investors. The auction mechanism ensures settlement completion and maintains market integrity by addressing delivery failures through forced buy-ins at prevailing auction prices.
