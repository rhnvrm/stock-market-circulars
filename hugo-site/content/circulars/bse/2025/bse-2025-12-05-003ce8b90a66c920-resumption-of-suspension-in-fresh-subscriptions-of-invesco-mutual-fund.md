title: Resumption of Subscription in fresh subscriptions of Invesco Mutual Fund
---

## Summary

Invesco Mutual Fund has revoked the temporary suspension of subscriptions in three overseas fund of fund schemes, effective December 5, 2025. The suspension was initially imposed vide notice dated October 9, 2025. Subscriptions through lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh registrations for SIP/STP/IDCW Transfer Plans will now be permitted in the designated schemes, subject to available headroom within overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022.

## Key Points

- Subscription resumption effective December 5, 2025 for three designated overseas fund of fund schemes
- Applies to: Invesco India - Invesco Global Equity Income Fund of Fund, Invesco India - Invesco Pan European Equity Fund of Fund, and Invesco India - Invesco Global Consumer Trends Fund of Fund
- Subscriptions allowed through lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh SIP/STP/IDCW Transfer Plan registrations
- Subscriptions permitted only up to available headroom within overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022 at Fund level
- AMC reserves right to re-suspend subscriptions if overseas investments approach the February 1, 2022 limits
- All other terms and conditions of SIDs and KIMs remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational decision by Invesco Asset Management (India) Pvt. Ltd. to resume subscriptions in specific fund of fund schemes while managing compliance with overseas investment limits.

## Compliance Requirements

- Invesco AMC will monitor overseas investment levels against February 1, 2022 limits
- AMC may temporarily suspend subscriptions again if limits are approached
- Investors should read all scheme related documents carefully before investing
- Notice-cum-addendum forms integral part of SIDs/KIMs of the designated schemes

## Important Dates

- **December 3, 2025**: Notice issued
- **December 5, 2025**: Effective date for resumption of subscriptions in designated schemes
- **October 9, 2025**: Original suspension notice date (now revoked)
- **February 1, 2022**: Reference date for overseas investment limits

## Impact Assessment

Limited impact confined to investors and prospective investors in the three specified Invesco overseas fund of fund schemes. The resumption provides investment opportunities for those interested in global equity exposure through these schemes, subject to headroom availability. The conditional nature of the resumption (tied to overseas investment limits) means subscriptions could be suspended again if limits are approached. No broader market impact anticipated as this is a fund-specific operational matter.
