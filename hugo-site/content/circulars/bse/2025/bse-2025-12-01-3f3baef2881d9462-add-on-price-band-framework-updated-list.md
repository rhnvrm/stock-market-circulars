title: Add-on Price Band Framework - Updated List of 39 Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an updated list of 39 securities that are subject to the Add-on Price Band Framework, a heightened surveillance measure. This framework imposes additional price movement restrictions beyond the normal daily circuit filters, limiting the trading range for these securities. The list includes companies across various sectors that have been identified for enhanced monitoring due to specific market behavior or compliance concerns.

## Key Points

- 39 securities are currently under the Add-on Price Band Framework
- Securities span multiple sectors including manufacturing, finance, infrastructure, and technology
- Add-on price bands restrict price movements beyond normal circuit limits
- This is a surveillance measure to control excessive volatility or speculative trading
- Complete list includes scrip codes, ISIN numbers, and company names
- Investors should exercise caution when trading these securities

## Regulatory Changes

This circular provides an updated list of securities under the existing Add-on Price Band Framework. No new regulatory changes are introduced; this is a periodic update of the securities list subject to this surveillance mechanism.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure awareness of the add-on price band restrictions for these securities
- Brokers should inform clients about the limited trading ranges applicable to these stocks

- Market participants must comply with the restricted price movement limits when placing orders

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** December 1, 2025
- **Effective Date:** Immediate (securities currently under surveillance)
