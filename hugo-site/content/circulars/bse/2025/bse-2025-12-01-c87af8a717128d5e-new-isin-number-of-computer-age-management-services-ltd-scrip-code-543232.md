title: New ISIN Number for Computer Age Management Services Ltd - Sub-Division of
  Equity Shares
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a notice regarding the allocation of a new ISIN number for Computer Age Management Services Ltd (Scrip Code: 543232) following the sub-division of equity shares. The new ISIN INE596I01020 will be effective for equity shares of Rs.2/- each, replacing the previous denomination of Rs.10/- per share. This change follows the earlier exchange notice dated November 24, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Computer Age Management Services Ltd (CAMS)
- Scrip Code: 543232
- New ISIN Number: INE596I01020
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Rs.2/-
- Ratio: 1:5 split (each Rs.10 share becomes 5 shares of Rs.2)
- Ex-date for new ISIN: December 5, 2025
- Document Reference: DR-771/2025-2026
- Notice Number: 20251201-5

## Regulatory Changes

The new ISIN number represents a change in the security identification for CAMS equity shares following the share sub-division. Trading members must ensure their systems are updated to reflect the new ISIN for all trades executed on or after the ex-date.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN INE596I01020
- All trades from December 5, 2025 onwards must use the new ISIN
- Depository participants need to update records to reflect the new denomination and ISIN
- Investors should verify their demat accounts reflect the correct number of shares post-subdivision

## Important Dates

- **December 1, 2025**: Notice date and circular issue date
- **December 5, 2025**: Ex-date - New ISIN becomes effective for all trades
- **November 24, 2025**: Previous related exchange notice (20251124-12)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the face value to one-fifth. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors by lowering the per-share price. The new ISIN ensures proper tracking and settlement of the subdivided shares.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems, clearing and settlement systems, and investor portfolios will need to reflect the new ISIN and adjusted share quantities. This is a standard corporate action with established procedures, so operational disruption should be minimal if systems are updated timely.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares of Rs.2/- face value for every 1 share of Rs.10/- face value held. The total investment value remains unchanged, but the number of shares increases proportionally.
