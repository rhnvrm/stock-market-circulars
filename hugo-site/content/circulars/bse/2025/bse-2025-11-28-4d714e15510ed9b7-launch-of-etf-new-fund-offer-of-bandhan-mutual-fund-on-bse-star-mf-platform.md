## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine NFO launch for a silver ETF product that expands investment options in the commodity ETF segment but does not materially affect broader market operations.

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium - BSE StAR MF Platform members need to ensure compliance with fund settlement timelines and inform clients about the NFO opportunity. The extended midnight deadline for lumpsum purchases provides operational flexibility.

**Investor Impact**: Low - Provides investors with a new silver ETF investment option through both regular and direct plan routes, expanding commodity exposure options in the mutual fund space.
