## Impact Assessment

**Corporate Impact:** The complete extinguishment of promoter shareholding represents a fundamental restructuring of the company's ownership under NCLT supervision, typically associated with insolvency resolution proceedings. This indicates the company has undergone or is undergoing financial distress resolution.

**Shareholder Impact:** Existing public shareholders retain their holdings on an as-is basis, but their percentage ownership will increase to 13.45% due to promoter share cancellation and new equity allotment. The shareholding pattern will be significantly altered.

**Market Impact:** Trading remains suspended, limiting immediate market impact. The resolution plan implementation may eventually lead to trading resumption once restructuring is complete. The notice emphasizes continuation of public shareholding, providing some stability for existing minority shareholders.

**Legal Significance:** NCLT-approved resolution plans are binding and represent court-sanctioned corporate reorganization, typically under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code framework.
