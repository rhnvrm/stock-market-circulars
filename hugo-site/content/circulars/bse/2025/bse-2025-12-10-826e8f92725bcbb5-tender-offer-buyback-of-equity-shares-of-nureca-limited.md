Shares will trade on an ex-entitlement basis from December 12, 2025 under settlement number DR-776/2025-2026.

- Security Type: Dematerialised securities in rolling settlement segment

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must take note of the record date and ex-entitlement date
- Only shareholders holding shares as of the record date (December 12, 2025) will be eligible to participate in the buyback
- Shares purchased on or after the ex-entitlement date will not carry buyback eligibility

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 10, 2025

- **Ex-Entitlement Date:** December 12, 2025
- **Settlement Number:** DR-776/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Shareholders:** Medium impact for NURECA shareholders. Those holding shares as of the record date can tender their shares in the buyback offer, potentially providing an exit opportunity at the buyback price.

**Market Impact:** Limited broader market impact. The ex-entitlement trading from December 12, 2025 may result in price adjustment as shares trade without buyback rights.

**Liquidity Impact:** Temporary reduction in floating stock if the buyback is successful, potentially affecting liquidity in NURECA shares post-buyback completion.
