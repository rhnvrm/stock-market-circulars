## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework continues to be applied with 5/15/30 day monitoring stages. Securities are shortlisted based on surveillance parameters and may transition between different surveillance frameworks including LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge Framework, and ESM Framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised list of securities under ST-ASM framework
- Trading in newly added securities will be subject to ST-ASM restrictions from November 03, 2025
- Securities moving to Trade for Trade framework will have different trading restrictions
- Investors and traders should review position limits and margin requirements for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 03, 2025 - New ST-ASM classifications become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of 8 securities to ST-ASM framework will result in enhanced surveillance and potentially reduced liquidity in these stocks. The removal of 14 securities (particularly those moving to Trade for Trade) indicates transition to different regulatory oversight mechanisms.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ST-ASM face stricter monitoring, potential price bands, and enhanced margin requirements. Four securities moving to Trade for Trade framework will have intraday trading restrictions removed, requiring delivery-based settlement.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding positions in newly added ST-ASM securities should be aware of potential liquidity constraints and enhanced volatility monitoring. Those in securities moving out should understand the implications of their new surveillance category.
