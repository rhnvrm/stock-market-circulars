title: Price Band Revisions for 18 Listed Companies Effective August 1, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 18 listed companies effective August 1, 2025. The changes include adjustments to both large-cap stocks like ACC Ltd and Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd (20% bands) and smaller companies with varying band percentages ranging from 2% to 20%.

## Key Points

- 18 scrips affected with price band revisions
- Changes effective from August 1, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% (RSC International) to 20% (multiple large companies)
- Most major companies maintain 20% price bands
- Some smaller/specialized companies have tighter bands (2%, 5%, 10%)

## Regulatory Changes

Price band percentages have been revised for specific securities as a surveillance measure. No fundamental change to price band mechanism, only adjustments to existing band percentages.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands from August 1, 2025
- All trading systems must reflect new price band limits
- Members can contact bse.surv@bseindia.com for clarifications

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 1, 2025
- **Notice Date**: July 31, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on affected securities' trading patterns. Tighter price bands (like RSC International at 2%) will limit intraday volatility, while maintained 20% bands for large-caps suggest normal trading conditions. The changes appear to be routine surveillance adjustments rather than emergency measures.
