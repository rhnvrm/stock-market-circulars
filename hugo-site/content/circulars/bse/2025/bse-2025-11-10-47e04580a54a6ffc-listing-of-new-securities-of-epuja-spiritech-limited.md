## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine preferential allotment affecting only EPUJA SPIRITECH LIMITED with no broader market implications.

**Company Impact**: The preferential issue raises capital for the company while diluting existing shareholding. The lock-in period ensures commitment from non-promoter investors for approximately 18 months post-allotment.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution from 12 lakh new shares. The preferential pricing at Rs. 3.40/- provides context for valuation assessment.
