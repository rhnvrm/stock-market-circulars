**Market Impact**: Medium - Approximately 79% of listed shares are locked-in, limiting immediate tradable float. The staggered unlock schedule will gradually increase available float over 18 months, potentially impacting stock liquidity and price discovery.

**Investor Impact**: Important for investors to understand that majority of shares will unlock progressively. First major unlock of anchor investor shares occurs within 30-90 days, followed by 6-month and 18-month promoter unlocks. This information is critical for assessing potential supply pressure at different timeframes.
