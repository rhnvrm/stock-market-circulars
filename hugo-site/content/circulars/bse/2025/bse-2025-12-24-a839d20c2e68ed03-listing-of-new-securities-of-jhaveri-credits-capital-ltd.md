- Shares allocated in two tranches with specific distribution numbers for tracking

## Impact Assessment

This is a company-specific listing event with minimal market-wide impact. The preferential allotment represents warrant conversions to Non-Promoters, indicating capital raising activity. The relatively small issue size (5 lakh shares at Rs. 285/- totaling approximately Rs. 1.43 crores) suggests limited dilution impact. The lock-in period until June 30, 2026 restricts immediate selling pressure. Trading members should note the new securities for client servicing purposes.
