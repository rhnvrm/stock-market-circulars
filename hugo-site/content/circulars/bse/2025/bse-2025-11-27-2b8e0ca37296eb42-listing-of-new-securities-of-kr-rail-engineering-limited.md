## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal immediate market impact as it relates to shares issued under a corporate restructuring scheme with significant lock-in restrictions. The 1.67 crore shares under lock-in until November 30, 2026 will not be available for trading, limiting supply impact. The scheme of arrangement was completed with allotment in October 2024, and this notification merely formalizes the trading permission. Investors should note the substantial promoter shareholding lock-in when assessing liquidity.
