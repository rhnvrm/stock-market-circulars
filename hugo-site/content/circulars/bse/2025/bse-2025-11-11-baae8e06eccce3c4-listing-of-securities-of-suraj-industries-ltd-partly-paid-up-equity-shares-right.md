## Impact Assessment

This listing has limited market-wide impact as it pertains to a single company's rights issue. The impact is primarily on:
- Existing shareholders of Suraj Industries Ltd who participated in the rights issue
- Trading members who need to update their systems with the new scrip details
- Investors interested in trading these partly paid-up shares

The listing in 'X' Group indicates these are securities with specific characteristics requiring investor attention. The partly paid-up nature means shareholders have future payment obligations (Rs. 30/- remaining) at the Board's discretion, which represents a contingent liability for holders.
