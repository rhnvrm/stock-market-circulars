- Units allotted to non-sponsors on preferential basis
- New units rank pari-passu with existing units
- Distribution numbers: 607752449 to 640010513
- Scrip Code: 543261, ISIN: INE0FDU25010

## Impact Assessment

The preferential allotment increases the total unit base of Brookfield India REIT, potentially diluting existing unitholders' stakes. The one-year lock-in period provides stability by preventing immediate selling pressure from new allottees. The issue price of Rs. 310 per unit will serve as a reference point for market valuation.
