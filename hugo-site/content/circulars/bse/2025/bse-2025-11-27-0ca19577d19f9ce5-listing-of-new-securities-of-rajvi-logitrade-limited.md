## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notice with limited market impact. The preferential allotment increases the equity capital of Rajvi Logitrade Limited, with substantial lock-in periods ensuring promoter and non-promoter commitment. The staggered lock-in structure (approximately 51.9% locked until June 2027 and 48.1% locked until May 2026) provides stability to the shareholding pattern. Trading members should note the lock-in restrictions when processing client orders.
