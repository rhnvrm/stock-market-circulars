## Summary

BSE has announced that the equity shares of BAI-KAKAJI POLYMERS LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544670), an SME IPO listing, will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to the Rolling segment under M Group effective January 14, 2026. This follows the exchange's previous notice dated December 30, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: BAI-KAKAJI POLYMERS LIMITED (SME IPO)
- Scrip Code: 544670
- Current Classification: Trade for Trade segment (MT Group)
- New Classification: Rolling segment (M Group)
- Effective Date: Wednesday, January 14, 2026
- Previous Related Notice: 20251230-33 dated December 30, 2025
- Contact Person: Mr. Anurag Jain (Tel: 022-2272 8822)

## Regulatory Changes

The stock will transition from a restricted trading mechanism (Trade for Trade) to normal rolling settlement, indicating maturity of the SME listing and improved liquidity conditions. This represents a positive development for the stock's trading flexibility.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new group classification
- Trading members should contact Mr. Anurag Jain for clarification or technical details regarding the transition
- All trading in the security must follow M Group rules from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **December 30, 2025**: Initial notice issued (Notice No. 20251230-33)
- **December 31, 2025**: Current notice date confirming the change
- **January 14, 2026**: Effective date for group transfer from MT to M Group

## Impact Assessment

This change positively impacts the stock's liquidity and trading flexibility. The shift from Trade for Trade (where each transaction requires immediate delivery and payment) to Rolling settlement allows for normal T+1 settlement cycles, reducing trading friction and potentially increasing investor participation. This is a standard progression for SME IPO stocks that demonstrate stable trading patterns.
