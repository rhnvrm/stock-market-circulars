## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts:**
- Enhanced liquidity as the stock moves to rolling settlement
- Investors can use margin trading facilities
- Reduced transaction costs compared to Trade for Trade segment
- Normal price discovery mechanism with intraday trading allowed

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members need to reconfigure systems and risk parameters
