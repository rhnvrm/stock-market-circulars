Two securities have been newly shortlisted: Duke Offshore Ltd (Scrip Code: 531471) and Libord Finance Ltd (Scrip Code: 511593). One security, Continental Controls Ltd, is being removed from the framework due to its inclusion in the ESM Framework.

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework is a surveillance measure designed to alert investors about securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or trading patterns. Securities under this framework are subject to enhanced monitoring and may have trading restrictions. The framework operates in multiple stages (I, II, III, IV) with progressively stricter surveillance measures.

Securities can move between different surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, GSM, ESM, IBC, Trade for Trade) based on their trading characteristics and compliance status.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should be aware of securities under LT-ASM and the applicable trading restrictions
- Enhanced due diligence required when trading securities under surveillance measures

- Trading members must comply with all surveillance framework requirements for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 07, 2025 - Changes to LT-ASM framework become applicable
