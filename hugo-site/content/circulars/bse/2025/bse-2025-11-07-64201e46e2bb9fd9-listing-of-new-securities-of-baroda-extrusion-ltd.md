## Impact Assessment

This is a company-specific listing notification with minimal market-wide impact. The preferential allotment increases the total equity base of Baroda Extrusion Ltd. by 4.53 crore shares. Lock-in provisions ensure that 100% of the newly issued shares cannot be freely traded until June 2026-2027, limiting immediate liquidity impact. Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect and promoter/non-promoter participation details.
