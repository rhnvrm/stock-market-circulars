## Summary

DSP Mutual Fund has extended the New Fund Offer (NFO) period of DSP MSCI India ETF by two days. The NFO, which was originally scheduled to close on November 17, 2025, will now close on November 19, 2025. This is an open-ended scheme designed to replicate/track the MSCI India Index.

## Key Points

- DSP MSCI India ETF NFO commenced on November 10, 2025
- Original closing date was November 17, 2025
- NFO period extended by two days
- Revised closing date is November 19, 2025
- Scheme is an open-ended ETF tracking MSCI India Index
- This is a notice cum-addendum to the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an administrative modification to the NFO timeline that overrides conflicting provisions in the original SID and KIM documents.

## Compliance Requirements

- Unit holders are requested to update their PAN, KYC, email address, mobile number, and nominee details with the AMC
- Unit holders are advised to link their PAN with Aadhaar Number
- Unit holders should check for unclaimed redemptions, IDCW payments, or inactive/unclaimed folios on the Fund's website
- Unit holders can view the Investor Charter on the Fund's website

## Important Dates

- **NFO Commencement Date**: November 10, 2025
- **Original NFO Closing Date**: November 17, 2025
- **Revised NFO Closing Date**: November 19, 2025 (Extended by 2 days)
- **Circular Date**: November 11, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This extension has minimal market impact as it only affects prospective investors interested in subscribing to the DSP MSCI India ETF during the NFO period. The two-day extension provides additional time for investors to participate in the new fund offer. All other provisions of the SID and KIM remain unchanged. This is a routine administrative adjustment common in mutual fund operations and does not affect existing market operations or trading activities.
