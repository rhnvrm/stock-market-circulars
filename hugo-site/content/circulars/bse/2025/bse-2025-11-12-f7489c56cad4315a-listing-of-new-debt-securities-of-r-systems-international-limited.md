This is a routine debt listing with limited market-wide impact. The listing adds Rs. 275 crore of CRISIL AA-/Stable rated debt securities to the BSE Debt segment. The securities are privately placed and therefore have a limited investor base. The 9.75% interest rate reflects current market conditions for AA- rated corporate debt. Trading members can now facilitate transactions in these securities for eligible investors holding these instruments.
