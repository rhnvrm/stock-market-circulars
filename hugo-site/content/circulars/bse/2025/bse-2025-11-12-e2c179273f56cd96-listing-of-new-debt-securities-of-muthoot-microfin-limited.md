## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing of privately placed debt securities targeting institutional investors. The securities are not accessible to retail investors given the high face value of Rs. 1,00,000 per unit.

**Issuer Impact**: Positive for Muthoot Microfin Limited as it provides additional debt capital for business operations with competitive interest rates of 9.9-10% p.a.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to institutional debt investors who participated in the private placement. The CRISIL A+/Positive rating indicates adequate safety with positive outlook.

**Liquidity**: Expected to be limited given the private placement nature and institutional investor base. Market lot of 1 unit provides flexibility for trading.
