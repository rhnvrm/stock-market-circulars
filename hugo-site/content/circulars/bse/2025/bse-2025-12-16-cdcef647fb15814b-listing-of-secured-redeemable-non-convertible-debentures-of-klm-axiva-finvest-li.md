## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine listing of corporate debt securities. The listing provides fixed-income investment opportunities for debt investors seeking exposure to non-banking financial company (NBFC) paper with BBB rating.

**Investor Impact**: Medium for debt investors - The NCDs offer competitive yields (9.92% to 11.30%) with investment-grade credit rating, providing options for investors with different maturity preferences (2-7 years) and cash flow requirements (monthly, annual, or cumulative interest payments).

**Liquidity**: The listing on BSE provides a secondary market platform for NCD holders to trade these securities, though actual liquidity may vary based on trading volumes.

**Risk Considerations**: Credit risk rated at BBB/Stable level; no put/call options available limiting early exit flexibility; interest rate risk varies by maturity tenure.
