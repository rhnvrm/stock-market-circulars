## Summary

BSE has implemented enhancements to the Request for Quote (RFQ) platform in the debt segment to improve operational efficiency as per SEBI directions. The changes include removal of manual broker selection for One-to-Many (OTM) brokered transactions and introduction of a yield-price calculator. These enhancements will be effective from October 28, 2025.

## Key Points

- Brokered transactions must now be executed by brokers on behalf of participants in OTM mode only on the RFQ Platform

- New yield-price calculator feature added for seamless conversion between clean/dirty price and yield
- This calculator is in addition to the existing yield calculator on the platform
- Changes effective from October 28, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

As per SEBI recommendations, the Exchange has modified the execution mechanism for brokered transactions:

- Previously, client trades on BSE RFQ platform were allowed with manual broker selection (introduced via notice 20221229-40 dated December 29, 2022)
- Now, brokered transactions are required to be executed exclusively through brokers on behalf of participants in OTM mode
