---

## Summary

BSE has issued a new ISIN number for KSE Ltd (Scrip Code: 519421) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs.10/- to Re.1/-. The new ISIN number INE953E01022 will be effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of October 28, 2025. This notice is in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251009-10 dated October 09, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN number: INE953E01022
- Company: KSE Ltd (Scrip Code: 519421)
- Corporate action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Re.1/-
- Face value change: From Rs.10 per share to Re.1 per share (10:1 split)
- DR reference: DR-744/2025-2026
- Trading members are informed to update their systems accordingly

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action notification following SEBI guidelines for share sub-division and ISIN assignment procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number INE953E01022 before the ex-date
- All trades executed on or after October 28, 2025 must use the new ISIN
- Ensure proper mapping of old and new ISIN in trading and settlement systems
- Update client records and holdings with the new ISIN post ex-date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 24, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: October 28, 2025 (effective date for new ISIN)
- **Reference to Previous Notice**: October 09, 2025 (Notice No. 20251009-10)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10 times while reducing the face value proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and depositories must ensure timely system updates to reflect the new ISIN. Failure to update could result in trade rejections or settlement issues post ex-date.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their shareholding multiplied by 10 with proportionate reduction in face value. No change in total investment value, but improved liquidity expected due to lower price per share post-split.
