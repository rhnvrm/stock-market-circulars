  YARNS LIMITED
---

## Summary

RISHAB SPECIAL YARNS LIMITED (scrip code: 514177) has completed signing agreements with both depositories (NSDL and CDSL), enabling the company to migrate from Group P to Group X. Effective from Friday, November 14, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-756/2025-2026), all trades in this scrip will be settled in compulsory dematerialised form with revised trading parameters.

## Key Points

- Company migrating from Group P to Group X
- Market lot revised from 100 shares to 1 share
- Compulsory demat settlement becomes mandatory
- Scrip to be traded in Normal Rolling Segment
- Netting allowed in the scrip
- Shortages will be auctioned
- ISIN remains unchanged: INE351D01013

## Regulatory Changes

- **Group Classification**: Migration from Group P (physical settlement allowed) to Group X (compulsory demat settlement)
- **Market Lot**: Reduced from 100 equity shares to 1 equity share per lot
- **Settlement Mode**: All trades must be settled in dematerialised form only (physical certificates not accepted)
- **Trading Segment**: Scrip will trade in Normal Rolling Segment with standard T+2 settlement cycle

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure all trades in scrip code 514177 are settled in demat form only
- Investors holding physical shares must convert them to demat form to trade
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect new market lot of 1 share
- Members must update client records regarding the group migration
- Auction mechanism to be applied for settlement shortages

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: Friday, November 14, 2025
- **Settlement Number**: DR-756/2025-2026
- **Notice Date**: November 13, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: The migration to Group X eliminates physical settlement, requiring all shareholders to dematerialize their holdings to participate in trading. The market lot reduction from 100 to 1 share significantly lowers the minimum investment requirement, potentially improving liquidity and accessibility for retail investors.

**Trading Impact**: The change to single-share market lots allows more precise position management and reduces capital requirements for market entry. Netting permissions and auction mechanisms for shortages provide standard settlement safeguards.

**Investor Impact**: Existing physical shareholders must convert to demat to sell their holdings. The unchanged ISIN (INE351D01013) ensures continuity in demat holdings without requiring any transfer or conversion by demat shareholders.
