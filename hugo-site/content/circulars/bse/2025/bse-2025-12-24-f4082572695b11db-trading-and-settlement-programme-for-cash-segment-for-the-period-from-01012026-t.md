  Settlement Cycles)

## Summary

BSE has published the trading and settlement programme for the cash segment covering January 1-31, 2026. The circular provides detailed schedules for both T+1 and T+0 settlement cycles, including settlement numbers, trading dates, depository entry dates, custodian confirmation timelines, pay-in/pay-out dates, and auction schedules. The programme covers 21 T+1 settlements (DR-789/25-26 to DR-809/25-26) and 21 T+0 settlements (DR-484/25-26 to DR-504/25-26).

## Key Points

- T+1 settlement cycle includes 21 regular settlements from DR-789/25-26 to DR-809/25-26
- T+0 settlement cycle includes 21 same-day settlements from DR-484/25-26 to DR-504/25-26
- Trading starts on January 1, 2026 and continues through January 30, 2026
- Each T+1 settlement includes corresponding auction settlements (RA-series)
- Auction pay-in occurs 1-3 days after main settlement pay-out
- OTR allocation (Give-up entry) can be done by members until 8:00 PM on T day
- OTR confirmation (Take-up entry) timing appears truncated in the circular content
- Weekend and holiday adjustments are reflected in the schedule (gaps on January 4-5, 10-11, 17-18, 24-26, 31)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory or policy changes introduced. This is a routine operational schedule circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must enter 6A/7A data on specified dates (same as trading date for T+1)
- Custodians must confirm 6A/7A data by the dates specified in the schedule
- Members must submit auction offers on designated auction settlement dates
- OTR allocation entries must be completed by 8:00 PM on T day
- All participants must adhere to the published pay-in/pay-out dates for settlements

## Important Dates

- **Programme Period**: January 1, 2026 to January 31, 2026
- **First T+1 Settlement**: DR-789/25-26 (Trade: Jan 1, Pay-in/out: Jan 2)
- **Last T+1 Settlement**: DR-809/25-26 (Trade: Jan 30, Pay-in/out: Feb 2)
- **First T+0 Settlement**: DR-484/25-26 (Trade & Pay-in/out: Jan 1)
- **Last T+0 Settlement**: DR-504/25-26 (Trade & Pay-in/out: Jan 30)
- **Extended Pay-out Dates**: January 5, 12, 19, 27, February 2 (post-weekend/holiday settlements)
- **Extended Auction Dates**: Multiple auction pay-outs extend into February 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - All market participants, clearing members, custodians, and depositories must align their operations with the published schedule. Proper planning is essential for resource allocation, liquidity management, and meeting settlement obligations.

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine schedule that maintains continuity of market operations. No changes to settlement mechanisms or cycles.

**Participant Action Required**: Market participants must update their internal systems and calendars with the settlement schedule, ensure adequate resources for pay-in/pay-out dates, and plan for extended timelines around weekends and holidays (Republic Day on January 26 likely causing the January 24-26 gap).
