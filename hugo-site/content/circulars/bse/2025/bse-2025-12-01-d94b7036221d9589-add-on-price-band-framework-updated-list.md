title: Add-on Price Band Framework - Updated List of 39 Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an updated list of 39 securities that are subject to the Add-on Price Band Framework. This surveillance measure applies additional price band restrictions to these securities beyond the normal price bands, typically to curb excessive volatility or unusual trading activity. The list includes companies across various sectors including manufacturing, finance, infrastructure, and technology.

## Key Points

- 39 securities are currently under the Add-on Price Band Framework
- Companies span diverse sectors including industrial manufacturing, financial services, infrastructure, and technology
- Notable stocks include Taparia Tools Ltd, Apis India Ltd, and Artificial Electronics Intelligent Material Ltd
- Each security is identified by its unique scrip code and ISIN number
- This represents an updated list, suggesting periodic review and modification of securities under this framework

## Regulatory Changes

This circular provides an updated list of securities under the existing Add-on Price Band Framework. The framework itself is a surveillance measure that imposes stricter price movement limits on selected securities. The update suggests that the composition of securities under this framework is reviewed periodically based on market conditions and trading patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure awareness of the add-on price band restrictions applicable to these 39 securities
- Orders for these securities must comply with the additional price band limitations
- Risk management systems should be configured to account for the enhanced price band framework
- Investors and traders should be informed about the special trading conditions applicable to these stocks

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: December 1, 2025
- Effective Date: Not explicitly specified, likely immediate upon publication

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Moderate impact on liquidity and trading activity for the 39 listed securities. The add-on price band framework restricts the maximum price movement allowed, which may limit intraday volatility but could also reduce liquidity during periods of high demand or supply.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities need to be aware of the enhanced restrictions. The framework may provide some protection against extreme price movements but could also make it harder to enter or exit positions during volatile periods.

**Market Significance:** This is a surveillance measure targeting specific securities rather than a broad market regulation. The relatively small number of affected securities limits systemic impact, though individual companies and their shareholders are directly affected.
