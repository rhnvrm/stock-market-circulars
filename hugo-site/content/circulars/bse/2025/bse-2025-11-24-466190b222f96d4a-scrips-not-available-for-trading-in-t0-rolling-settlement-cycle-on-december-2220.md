## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that eight specific scrips will not be available for trading in the T+0 (same-day settlement) rolling settlement cycle on two specific dates in December 2025. On December 22, 2025, four scrips (INDIGO, TMPV, MAXHEALTH, INDUSINDBK) will be unavailable, and on December 26, 2025, four banking stocks (CANBK, AUBANK, PNB, UNIONBANK) will be unavailable for T+0 trading.

- Regular trading in T+1/T+2 settlement cycles continues normally
- Affects both aviation/auto and banking sector stocks on different dates

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members need to update systems and client communications
- Investors planning T+0 trades in these scrips must use alternative settlement cycles
- No impact on long-term investors or those using regular settlement
- Selective nature suggests operational or technical reasons rather than market-wide concerns
