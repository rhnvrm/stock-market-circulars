## Summary

BSE has published the demat auction list for Settlement No. 741 dated October 24, 2025. The circular lists 156 scrips (78 pairs in two columns) along with their respective quantities being put up for demat auction. This is a routine settlement mechanism where securities that have failed delivery are auctioned to ensure settlement completion.

## Key Points

- Settlement Number: 741
- Date: October 24, 2025
- Total scrips listed: 156 securities across various sectors
- Quantities range from as low as 1 share to as high as 78,314 shares (Mehai Techno)
- Includes major stocks like Reliance Industries (10 shares), Infosys (25 shares), ITC (240 shares), ICICI Bank (40 shares)
- Covers diverse sectors: banking, pharmaceuticals, technology, metals, energy, FMCG, and specialty chemicals

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced in this circular. This is a standard settlement operation notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members with outstanding delivery obligations for the listed securities must participate in the auction process
- Members must ensure adequate funds/securities for auction settlement
- Auction participants must comply with BSE's standard auction settlement procedures and timelines
- Failed delivery positions must be squared off through the auction mechanism

## Important Dates

- Settlement Date: October 24, 2025 (Settlement No. 741)
- Auction execution date would follow as per BSE's standard auction timeline (typically T+2 or as specified separately)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects 156 securities across multiple sectors. While quantities for most major stocks are relatively small, some mid/small-cap stocks have significant quantities (e.g., Mehai Techno: 78,314 shares, Indian Infot: 34,240 shares, Remedium Life: 31,000 shares).

**Operational Impact:** Specific trading members with delivery failures in these securities will need to participate in the auction. The auction ensures market integrity by completing settlement obligations.

**Price Impact:** Potential temporary price volatility in securities with larger auction quantities, particularly for less liquid mid and small-cap stocks. Major large-cap stocks with small quantities (like Reliance, Infosys) unlikely to see material impact.

**Investor Impact:** Minimal for retail investors. This is primarily a settlement mechanism between trading members to fulfill delivery obligations.
