## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal immediate market impact as all issued shares are subject to lock-in restrictions until July 2026. The preferential allotment to non-promoters increases the free float of the company but will not affect trading liquidity until the lock-in period expires. The shares rank equally with existing equity shares in terms of voting rights and dividend entitlement.
