## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine mutual fund NFO launch that expands investment options for debt scheme investors seeking fixed maturity products with 789-day tenure.

**Operational Impact**: Standard operational procedures for BSE StAR MF platform members. The restriction on cheque and OTM payments streamlines processing and reduces settlement risk. Members need to ensure timely fund settlement to avoid transaction cancellations and maintain client relationships.

**Investor Impact**: Provides debt investment opportunity through DSP Mutual Fund with multiple plan options catering to different investor preferences (growth vs. income distribution).
