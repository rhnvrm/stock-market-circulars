## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Limited to shareholders and traders of U. H. ZAVERI LIMITED. Provides liquidity window for rights entitlements holders who wish to renounce their rights.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure compliance with disclosure and client communication requirements. Systems must handle dematerialized REs with proper ISIN identification and T+1 trade-for-trade settlement.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders receive opportunity to trade their rights entitlements during the 4-day renunciation window (Oct 30 - Nov 04) or participate in the rights issue until November 10, 2025. Unexercised rights will lapse, potentially causing value loss for inactive shareholders.
