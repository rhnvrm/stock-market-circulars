## Impact Assessment

This is a routine commercial paper listing with minimal market impact. The 91-day maturity instrument provides short-term funding to Network 18 Media & Investments Limited at competitive rates (implied discount rate of approximately 6% annualized). The A1+ credit ratings from both ICRA and India Ratings indicate strong creditworthiness. The listing expands the debt market inventory but has no direct impact on equity markets or broader trading operations. Trading is restricted to institutional participants given the Rs. 5 lakh minimum denomination.
