title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective December 05, 2025. The circular identifies securities newly entering the framework, those moving between ASM stages, and securities exiting ST-ASM due to inclusion in other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM, GSM, or Trade for Trade).

## Key Points

- 2 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework: Kapil Raj Finance Ltd and Mini Diamonds India Ltd
- 1 security (Eraaya Lifespaces Ltd) moving to higher Stage II ASM while continuing in ST-ASM
- 6 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework, including SME scrips and those moving to other surveillance frameworks
- Consolidated list includes 18+ securities across various ST-ASM stages
- Changes effective from December 05, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

**New Inclusions in ST-ASM (Stage I):**
- Kapil Raj Finance Ltd (Scrip Code: 539679, ISIN: INE332Q01023)
- Mini Diamonds India Ltd (Scrip Code: 523373, ISIN: INE281E01028)

**Stage升级 (Moving to Higher Stage):**
- Eraaya Lifespaces Ltd moved from Stage I to Stage II (Scrip Code: 531035, ISIN: INE432F01032)

**Exits from ST-ASM:**
- Batliboi Ltd (522004)
- Dhanashree Electronics Ltd* (542679) - moved to LT-ASM
- Halder Venture Ltd* (539854) - moved to LT-ASM
- Jet Freight Logistics Ltd$ (543420) - moved to ESM
- LS Industries Ltd (514446)
- Yug Decor Ltd@* (540550) - SME scrip moved to LT-ASM

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised surveillance status of affected securities
- Trading in ST-ASM securities subject to additional surveillance measures including stricter price bands and monitoring
- Securities marked with @ are SME scrips with specific surveillance requirements
- Securities marked with ~ are T+0 scrips shortlisted based on parent company
- Brokers and traders must comply with enhanced surveillance conditions for listed securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 05, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
The ST-ASM framework subjects securities to enhanced surveillance due to price volatility or other concerns. Securities in this framework face:
- Stricter price bands
- Increased monitoring by exchange
- Potential trading restrictions
- Additional disclosure requirements

**Affected Entities:**
- Investors holding or trading the 2 newly included securities will face enhanced surveillance conditions
- Eraaya Lifespaces Ltd investors will experience stricter Stage II measures
- 6 securities exiting ST-ASM will move to different surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM) or return to normal trading
- SME segment particularly affected with multiple scrips under surveillance

**Trading Implications:**
Securities under ST-ASM may experience reduced liquidity and higher transaction costs due to surveillance measures. Movement to higher stages indicates continued concerns, while exits to LT-ASM or ESM suggest long-term surveillance needs or enhanced monitoring requirements.
