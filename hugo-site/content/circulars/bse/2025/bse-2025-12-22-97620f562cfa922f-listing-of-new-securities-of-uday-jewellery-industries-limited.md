## Impact Assessment

The listing represents a routine preferential allotment to promoters following warrant conversion. With all 9,00,000 shares locked-in until August 31, 2027, there is no immediate impact on tradable float or market liquidity. The allotment indicates promoter commitment and capital infusion of approximately Rs. 13.86 crores (9,00,000 shares × Rs. 154) into the company. Market impact is minimal as these shares cannot be traded until lock-in expiry.
