## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Movement to X group severely restricts trading liquidity and frequency. Investors will face limited trading opportunities with trades permitted only once weekly.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and inform clients about the restricted trading status. The company's liquidity will be significantly impaired, potentially affecting stock valuation.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will face challenges in exiting positions due to limited trading windows and reduced liquidity. This may result in wider bid-ask spreads and price volatility.
