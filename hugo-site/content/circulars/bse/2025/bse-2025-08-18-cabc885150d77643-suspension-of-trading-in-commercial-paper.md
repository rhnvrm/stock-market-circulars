## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on debt market operations. While 20 companies are affected, this is a routine redemption process that temporarily removes liquidity from specific commercial paper securities. The staggered dates (August 19-24) help minimize concentrated market impact. Investors holding these commercial papers will receive redemption proceeds as scheduled.
