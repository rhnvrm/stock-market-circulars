## Impact Assessment

**Liquidity Impact:** Transfer to 'Z'/'MT' group severely restricts trading as all transactions must be settled on Trade-for-Trade basis, eliminating intraday trading opportunities and significantly reducing liquidity.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders face reduced exit options and higher price volatility due to restricted trading mechanism. No margin trading or carry forward positions allowed.

**Market Perception:** Classification in 'Z'/'MT' group signals regulatory non-compliance, potentially triggering further selling pressure and institutional divestment.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and trading members must adjust their systems to handle Trade-for-Trade settlement for these scrips, affecting operational workflows.

**Regulatory Trend:** 38 total companies affected (13 new + 25 existing) indicates widespread non-compliance with depositories regulations, suggesting need for enhanced corporate governance monitoring.
