- REs tradable only in dematerialized form
- Settlement on T+1 rolling settlement basis with trade-for-trade execution
- Trading members must inform clients that REs are not ordinary shares

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform all clients about commencement of RE trading and the specific ISIN (INE227G20034)
- Contract notes/bills for RE purchases must include prominent disclaimer stating that:
  - Purchase of REs only provides right to participate in Rights Issue by making application with requisite money or to renounce REs before issue closes
  - REs not subscribed or renounced before Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished
- Trading members must ensure clients do not mistake REs for ordinary shares of the company
- Trading members should refer to notice no-20200305-21 (March 05, 2020) and notice no-20200518-34 (May 18, 2020) for additional details

- **Rights Issue Closing Date:** December 09, 2025
- **Settlement Basis:** T+1 Rolling Settlement
- **Notice Date:** November 27, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Impact on INDOWIND ENERGY LIMITED Shareholders:**
- Existing shareholders receive Rights Entitlements that can be traded during the 4-day renunciation window
- Shareholders have options to: (1) subscribe to rights issue with application money, (2) renounce and sell REs in market, or (3) let REs lapse
- Short renunciation window (4 days) requires prompt decision-making

**Market Impact:**
- Limited to INDOWIND ENERGY LIMITED and its shareholders
- Trade-for-trade settlement reduces leverage but ensures delivery-based trading
- Dematerialization requirement ensures transparent and secure trading
- T+1 settlement provides quick turnaround for RE transactions

**Operational Considerations:**
- Trading members must update systems to handle RE trading for scrip code 751063
- Client communication and disclaimer requirements add operational steps
- Risk of client confusion between REs and ordinary shares necessitates clear communication
