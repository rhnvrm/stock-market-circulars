## Regulatory Changes

Price band modifications are surveillance measures to control volatility and unusual price movements. The varying percentages (2%, 5%, 10%, 20%) indicate different levels of trading restrictions based on each security's risk profile and trading behavior.

**Price Band Distribution:**
- 2% band: 2 securities (most restrictive)
- 5% band: 21 securities
- 10% band: 20 securities  
- 20% band: 14 securities (least restrictive)

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect new price bands before October 27, 2025
- Surveillance department contact: bse.surv@bseindia.com for clarifications
- Members must ensure compliance with revised trading limits for all 57 affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 24, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 27, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will restrict intraday price movements for these 57 securities, potentially reducing volatility but also limiting trading opportunities. Securities with tighter bands (2% and 5%) will experience more stringent price controls, which may impact liquidity. These measures are typically applied to securities exhibiting abnormal price behavior or requiring enhanced surveillance oversight. Traders and investors in these stocks should adjust their trading strategies accordingly to account for the reduced price movement limits.
