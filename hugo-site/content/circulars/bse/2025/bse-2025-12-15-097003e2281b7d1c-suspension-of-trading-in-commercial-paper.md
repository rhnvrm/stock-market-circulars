## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with limited market impact. The trading suspension affects only the specific commercial paper instruments scheduled for redemption and does not impact equity shares or other securities of these companies. Investors holding these commercial papers will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms. The suspension ensures orderly settlement of maturing instruments and prevents trading after the record date. Given the short-term nature of commercial papers, this is an expected part of their lifecycle.
