- Allotment date: November 13, 2025
- Trading commencement: November 18, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced by this circular. This is a standard listing notification for new securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the new units available for trading from November 18, 2025
- Lock-in restrictions must be observed as per specified tranches
- No trading permitted for locked-in units until respective lock-in expiry dates

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date:** November 13, 2025
- **Trading Commencement:** November 18, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry (Tranche 1):** November 30, 2026 (for 3.68 crore units)
- **Lock-in Expiry (Tranche 2):** November 30, 2028 (for 64.89 lakh units)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. This is a preferential allotment to the sponsor rather than a public offering, limiting immediate market supply impact. The lock-in provisions further restrict near-term tradability for the majority of newly issued units.

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal immediate impact as 64.89 lakh units (15% of allotment) are locked until 2028 and 3.68 crore units (85% of allotment) are locked until 2026.

**Investor Impact:** Existing unitholders should note the dilution from the preferential issue, though units rank equally with existing securities. The sponsor's increased stake may be viewed positively as demonstration of commitment to the trust.
