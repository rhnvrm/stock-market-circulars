## Summary

BSE has assigned a new ISIN number INE745G01043 to Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd (Scrip Code: 534091) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs.10/- to Rs.2/-. The new ISIN will be effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of January 2, 2026.

## Key Points

- New ISIN Number: INE745G01043
- Company: Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd
- Scrip Code: 534091
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Old Face Value: Rs.10/- per share
- New Face Value: Rs.2/- per share
- Ex-Date: January 2, 2026
- Delivery Reference: DR-790/2025-2026
- Notice Reference: Continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251222-11 dated December 22, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the ISIN change consequent to the stock sub-division approved by the company. The new ISIN will replace the old ISIN in all trading and settlement systems effective from the ex-date.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number
- All trades executed on or after January 2, 2026 must use the new ISIN INE745G01043
- Depository participants and investors will receive the sub-divided shares in their demat accounts with the new ISIN
- Record date and other corporate action details were communicated in the earlier notice dated December 22, 2025

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 24, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: January 2, 2026 (trades from this date onwards will be in new ISIN)
- **Reference Notice Date**: December 22, 2025 (Notice No. 20251222-11)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems are updated to recognize the new ISIN from the ex-date. The sub-division will increase the number of shares in circulation by 5x (Rs.10 to Rs.2) while proportionately reducing the price.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares of Rs.2/- face value for every 1 share of Rs.10/- face value held. The new shares will reflect in demat accounts with the new ISIN post the record date.

**Market Operations**: This is a standard corporate action with minimal operational disruption. The split ratio makes the stock more affordable for retail investors, potentially improving liquidity.
