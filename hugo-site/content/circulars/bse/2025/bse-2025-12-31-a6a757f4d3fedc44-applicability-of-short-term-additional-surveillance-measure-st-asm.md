## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective January 01, 2026. The circular identifies 9 securities being newly shortlisted, 1 security moving to higher stage ASM, 4 securities exiting the framework, and provides a consolidated list of all securities under ST-ASM surveillance.

## Key Points

- 9 securities newly shortlisted in ST-ASM framework including Anka India Ltd, Eraaya Lifespaces Ltd, Rain Industries Ltd, and Waa Solar Ltd
- 1 security (Pulsar International Ltd) continuing in ST-ASM but moving to higher stage
- 4 securities exiting ST-ASM framework: Dynavision Ltd, NDA Securities Ltd, Shree Metalloys Ltd (moving to ESM), and Takyon Networks Ltd
- Framework includes SME scrips and T+0 scrips with specific notations
- Securities categorized into different ASM stages (Stage I and higher)
- Some securities marked with asterisk are also listed on NSE

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies additional surveillance measures to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or excessive speculation. Securities in this framework face:
- Enhanced margin requirements
- Stricter position limits
- Increased monitoring of trading activities
- Potential restrictions on intraday trading

Securities exit ST-ASM when they move to other surveillance frameworks including LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM (Graded Surveillance Measure), Pledge Framework, or ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with enhanced margin requirements for securities under ST-ASM
- Brokers must inform clients about securities under surveillance measures
- Market participants should note the stage-wise ASM applicability for each security
- Special attention required for SME scrips (marked @) and T+0 scrips (marked ~) under the framework

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 01, 2026 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects trading liquidity and costs for the listed securities. Securities entering ST-ASM typically face reduced trading volumes due to higher margins and increased trading costs.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will face higher margin requirements and potential restrictions on intraday positions. This may lead to reduced liquidity and wider bid-ask spreads.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their risk management systems to reflect the new surveillance measures and ensure proper margin collection from clients trading these securities.
