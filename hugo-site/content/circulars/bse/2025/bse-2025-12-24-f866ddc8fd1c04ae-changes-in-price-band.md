---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 26 securities effective December 26, 2025. The changes involve tightening price bands for most scrips, with bands ranging from 2% to 20%. The majority of securities (17 out of 26) will have a 5% price band, while one security (RDB Real Estate Constructions Ltd) will have the most restrictive 2% band. These revisions are part of surveillance measures to control volatility and protect investors.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This circular implements routine surveillance measures under existing BSE regulations for price band adjustments based on market conditions and security-specific factors.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands from December 26, 2025
- All trades in affected securities must comply with new price band limits
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect revised bands before market opening on December 26, 2025
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 24, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 26, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Tighter price bands (particularly 2% and 5% bands for 18 securities) will reduce intraday volatility but may also impact liquidity and price discovery. Securities with restrictive bands may experience reduced trading volumes and wider bid-ask spreads.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in these securities will face limited intraday price movement, providing protection against excessive volatility but potentially making it harder to enter or exit positions at desired prices.

**Surveillance Rationale**: The predominance of tight bands (2% and 5%) suggests BSE has identified elevated risk or unusual trading patterns in these securities, warranting enhanced surveillance measures to protect market integrity.
