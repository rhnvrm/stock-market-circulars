## Summary

SEBI has mandated that all mutual fund investors must either appoint a nominee or formally opt-out of nomination for their investments. This requirement applies to both existing and new investors and involves OTP-based two-factor authentication along with either a signed declaration or video verification. From December 15, 2025, transactions for creating fresh folios under non-demat mode without proper nomination compliance will be rejected at the AMC/RTA level.

## Key Points

- All mutual fund investors must either nominate or formally opt-out for their investments
- Requirement applies to both existing and new investors
- Authentication involves OTP-based 2FA with signed declaration or video verification
- Missing nomination/opt-out details will lead to transaction rejection for fresh folios creation under non-demat mode
- Unique reference number must be generated and maintained for opt-out documentation
- Nomination details can be modified at any time with reauthentication
- Members must upload and store nomination opt-out documents for regulator access
- All UCC holders must authenticate through OTP for nomination updates

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has introduced mandatory nomination or opt-out requirements for mutual fund investments:

- **Nomination Requirement**: Investors must designate a nominee or formally opt-out
- **Authentication Protocol**: OTP-based two-factor authentication required for opt-out
- **Documentation**: Signed declaration form or video recording mandatory for opt-out
- **Reference Number System**: Unique acknowledgment number must be generated during opt-out process
- **Record Maintenance**: Members must store opt-out documents and provide to RTA/AMC/Regulator when required
- **Modification Process**: Nomination changes require reauthentication of all UCC holders

## Compliance Requirements

**For Investors:**
- Complete nomination or opt-out process before December 15, 2025

2. Submit formal declaration form or record video per SEBI norms

## Important Dates

- **December 15, 2025**: Transactions for fresh folios creation under non-demat mode without proper nomination compliance shall be liable for rejection at AMC/RTA level

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on:**
- All mutual fund investors required to take action
