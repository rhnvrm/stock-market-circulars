## Impact Assessment

This circular provides an investment opportunity in government securities with varying maturity periods (2028 to 2055) and coupon rates (5.91% to 7.24%). The non-competitive bidding facility allows smaller investors and trading members to participate in G-sec auctions without competing on price. The total issue size of Rs. 32,000 crore indicates significant government borrowing activity. The longer-tenure securities (2054, 2055) offer higher coupon rates, reflecting the yield curve dynamics. Impact is moderate as this is a routine auction process with established procedures.
