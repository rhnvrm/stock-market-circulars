## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Existing Shareholders**: The resolution plan resulted in dramatic capital structure changes with 100% promoter exit and 75% dilution of public shareholders. Existing public shareholders received only 1 share for every 4 shares held, significantly reducing their holdings.

**Capital Structure Transformation**: The paid-up capital increased over 21-fold from Rs. 3.50 crore to Rs. 74.79 crore through the combination of capital reduction, preferential allotment, and merger.

**Trading Restrictions**: Placement in XT Group and Trade-to-Trade segment indicates enhanced surveillance, limiting trading flexibility and potentially affecting liquidity.

**New Control**: The Successful Resolution Applicant gains significant control through preferential allotment, while the merger with RNIT Solutions & Services Limited brings new shareholders who will hold approximately 95% of the expanded capital.

**Investor Consideration**: The lock-in period until October 2026 for preferential shares and the company's emergence from insolvency proceedings are important factors for market participants to consider.
