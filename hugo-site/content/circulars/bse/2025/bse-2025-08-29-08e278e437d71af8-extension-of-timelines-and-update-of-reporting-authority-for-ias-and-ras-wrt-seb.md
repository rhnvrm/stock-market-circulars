title: Extension of Digital Accessibility Compliance Timelines for Investment Advisors
  and Research Analysts
---

## Summary

SEBI has extended compliance timelines for digital accessibility requirements under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, following representations from regulated entities. The circular also updates the reporting authority for Investment Advisors (IAs) and Research Analysts (RAs) from BASL/SEBI to BSE Ltd.

## Key Points

- Extension granted for all six compliance requirements under the digital accessibility circular
- Reporting authority for IAs and RAs changed to BSE Ltd for both categories
- Timeline extensions range from 1 month to 6 months depending on requirement
- Annual compliance reporting moved to next financial year (April 30, 2027)

## Regulatory Changes

- **Reporting Authority Update**: Investment Advisors and Research Analysts must now report compliance to BSE Ltd instead of BASL and SEBI respectively
- Stock Brokers/Depository Participants continue reporting to Stock Exchanges/Depositories
- MIIs and other regulated entities continue reporting to SEBI

## Compliance Requirements

1. **Action Report Submission**: Submit compliance report on actions taken (Extended to Sept 30, 2025)
2. **Digital Platforms List**: Provide list of digital platforms for investors (Extended to Sept 30, 2025)
3. **IAAP Certified Auditor Appointment**: Appoint certified accessibility professionals as auditors (Extended to Dec 14, 2025)
4. **Accessibility Audit Conduct**: Complete accessibility audits of digital platforms (Extended to April 30, 2026)
5. **Remediation**: Fix audit findings and ensure compliance (Extended to July 31, 2026)
6. **Annual Compliance**: Conduct annual accessibility audits and submit reports (Extended to April 30, 2027)

## Important Dates

- **September 30, 2025**: Compliance report and digital platforms list submission
- **December 14, 2025**: IAAP certified auditor appointment
- **April 30, 2026**: Complete accessibility audits
- **July 31, 2026**: Complete remediation of audit findings
- **April 30, 2027**: First annual compliance report submission

## Impact Assessment

The timeline extensions provide regulated entities with additional time to implement digital accessibility measures, reducing compliance pressure. The change in reporting authority for IAs and RAs to BSE Ltd centralizes oversight and may streamline the compliance process. This affects all regulated entities' digital platforms and requires appointment of specialized accessibility auditors.
