## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected as this is a routine administrative listing of ESOP/ESOS shares. The issuances represent employee compensation schemes rather than new capital raising activities. The absence of lock-in periods indicates these shares may be traded immediately, though typical employee vesting schedules may still apply at the company level. The total share count of approximately 3.24 million shares across 12 companies represents standard employee stock compensation activity with no material dilution concerns for most issuers except potentially Vishal Mega Mart with its larger issuance.
