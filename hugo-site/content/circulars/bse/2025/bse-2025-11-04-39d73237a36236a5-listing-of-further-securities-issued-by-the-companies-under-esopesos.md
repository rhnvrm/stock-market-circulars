## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new listings
- Standard trading rules and regulations apply to these securities
- No special compliance requirements as shares are not under lock-in

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 4, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: November 6, 2025 (Thursday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (no lock-in period)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The number of shares being listed is relatively small compared to the outstanding share capital of these companies. ESOP listings are routine corporate actions that typically have negligible impact on stock prices or trading volumes.

**For Investors**: These shares will increase the free float marginally and provide liquidity to employees who have exercised their stock options. No dilution concerns as these shares were already accounted for in the diluted share capital.

**For Companies**: Standard fulfillment of ESOP scheme obligations, demonstrating employee participation in company ownership.
