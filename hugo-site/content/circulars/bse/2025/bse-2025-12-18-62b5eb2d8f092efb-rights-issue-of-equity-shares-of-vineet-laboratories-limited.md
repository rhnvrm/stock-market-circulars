## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders of Vineet Laboratories will have the opportunity to subscribe to additional shares at Rs. 30 per share. The rights ratio of 13:12 represents a significant dilution opportunity for existing shareholders who can increase their stake proportionately.

**Market Impact**: Trading on ex-rights basis from December 23, 2025 will likely result in price adjustment reflecting the rights entitlement value. Shareholders not participating in the rights issue will see dilution of their holding percentage.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure proper handling of ex-rights transactions from the specified date to maintain accurate settlement and entitlement calculations.
