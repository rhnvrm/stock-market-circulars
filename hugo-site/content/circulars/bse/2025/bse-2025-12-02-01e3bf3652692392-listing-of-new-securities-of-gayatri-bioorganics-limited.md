## Summary

BSE has listed 1,70,06,802 equity shares of Gayatri BioOrganics Limited (Scrip Code: 524564) for trading with effect from December 03, 2025. These shares were issued at Rs.11.76 per share pursuant to a Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) order to promoters on a preferential basis. The allotment was originally made on October 13, 2016, and the shares are subject to lock-in periods.

## Key Points

- **Total Shares Listed:** 1,70,06,802 equity shares of Rs.10/- each
- **Issue Price:** Rs.11.76 per share
- **ISIN:** INE052E01015
- **Scrip Code:** 524564
- **Allotment Nature:** Preferential allotment to promoters under BIFR order
- **Trading Commencement:** December 03, 2025
- **Ranking:** Pari-passu with existing equity shares
- **Distinctive Numbers:** 61781341 to 78788142

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following BIFR order compliance.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities available for trading
- Lock-in restrictions must be observed as per the schedule provided
- The shares rank equally with existing equity shares for all corporate actions

## Important Dates

- **Original Allotment Date:** October 13, 2016
- **Trading Commencement Date:** December 03, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry (Batch 1):** June 30, 2026 - 12,49,173 shares (Dist. Nos. 77538970-78788142)
- **Lock-in Expiry (Batch 2):** June 30, 2027 - 1,57,57,629 shares (Dist. Nos. 61781341-77538969)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. While a significant number of shares (1.70 crore) are being listed, the majority (92.7%) remain locked-in until June 2027, with the remaining 7.3% locked until June 2026. This prevents immediate supply increase in the market.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal. Standard listing procedure for shares issued under BIFR restructuring. The long gap between allotment (2016) and listing (2025) suggests this is part of corporate restructuring completion.

**Investor Impact:** Limited immediate impact due to lock-in restrictions. Promoters cannot sell these shares until respective lock-in periods expire, providing stability to the shareholding pattern.
