## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it is a routine administrative notification for listing new government Treasury Bills. The listing expands the available debt instruments for institutional investors and traders focused on short-term government securities. The three T-Bills provide options across different maturity tenors (3 months, 6 months, and 12 months), allowing market participants to manage liquidity and duration requirements. Only debt market participants and institutional investors dealing in government securities will be directly affected.
