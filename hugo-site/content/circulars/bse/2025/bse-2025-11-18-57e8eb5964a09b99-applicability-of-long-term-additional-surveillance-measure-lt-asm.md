## Regulatory Framework

The Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) is a surveillance framework designed to monitor securities with specific characteristics warranting enhanced oversight. Securities under this framework face progressive restrictions based on ASM stages (I through IV), with higher stages imposing stricter trading conditions.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 19, 2025
- **Circular Date**: November 18, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of securities in LT-ASM Framework typically results in:
- Enhanced surveillance and monitoring
- Potential trading restrictions based on ASM stage
- Increased margin requirements for investors
- Price discovery through staged auction mechanisms
- Impact on liquidity for affected securities

Securities moved to higher stages (Stage II) face progressively stricter conditions. The movement of Panabyte Technologies Ltd to GSM Framework indicates heightened regulatory concerns requiring a different surveillance mechanism.
