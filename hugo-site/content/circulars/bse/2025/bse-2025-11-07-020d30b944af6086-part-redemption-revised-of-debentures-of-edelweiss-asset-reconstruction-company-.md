## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This notice affects only holders of specific private placement debentures of Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company Limited. As these are non-convertible debentures with limited public trading, the market-wide impact is minimal.

**Operational Impact**: Low - The part redemption has already occurred (record date was June 17, 2025), and this is a revised informational notice confirming the post-redemption face values. Trading members need only note the updated face values for their records.

**Investor Impact**: Low to Medium for affected debenture holders - While the partial redemption affects the outstanding principal amount for these specific debenture holders, all series maintain uniform post-redemption face values of Rs. 1,000 per debenture, providing clarity for position valuation.
