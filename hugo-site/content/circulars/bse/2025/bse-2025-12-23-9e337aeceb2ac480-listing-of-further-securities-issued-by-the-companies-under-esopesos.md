**Market Impact**: Low. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine corporate action with minimal impact on overall market liquidity or stock prices. The quantities being listed are relatively small compared to the total outstanding shares of these companies.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Market participants should update their records to reflect the increased share capital and new distinctive numbers for the listed companies. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares are immediately available for trading.
