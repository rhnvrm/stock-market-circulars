## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a routine listing notification for shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

- Trading members are informed of the new securities listing
- No special compliance actions required from market participants
- Standard trading procedures apply for newly listed shares

- **Listing and Trading Commencement Date**: October 31, 2025 (Friday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (all shares are freely tradable)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The issuance represents routine ESOP exercises across multiple companies. Even HDFC Bank's largest issuance of ~13 million shares represents a fractional percentage of its total outstanding shares.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible incremental impact on overall market liquidity. The shares add to the free float but volumes are relatively small compared to daily trading activity in these securities.

**Dilution Impact**: Minor dilution for existing shareholders across all listed companies. The share counts are typical for ESOP exercises and have been anticipated by the market.

**Investor Consideration**: No lock-in restrictions mean employees can immediately trade these shares, though this is standard practice for most ESOP schemes.
