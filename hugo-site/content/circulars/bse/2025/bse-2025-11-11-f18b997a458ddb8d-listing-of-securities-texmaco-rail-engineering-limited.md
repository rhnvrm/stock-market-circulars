## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note the listing of these new securities and the applicable lock-in restrictions when processing trades.

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: October 9, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: November 12, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The listing represents approximately 10-15% potential dilution (exact percentage dependent on existing share base). However, immediate market impact is minimal due to lock-in restrictions preventing trading of these shares. The 18-month lock-in on 3.51 million shares and 30-month lock-in on 3.89 million shares ensures gradual release into the market. The preferential allotment at Rs. 193/- provides capital infusion for the company while the warrant conversion mechanism indicates prior commitment from investors.
