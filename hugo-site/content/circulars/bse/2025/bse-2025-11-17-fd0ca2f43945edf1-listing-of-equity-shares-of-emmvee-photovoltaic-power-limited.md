## Impact Assessment

The listing of Emmvee Photovoltaic Power Limited adds another renewable energy/solar power company to BSE. With a high promoter holding of 80.03%, the company shows strong promoter commitment. However, 46.83% of promoter shares are pledged, which may be a point of concern for investors. The public float of 19.97% meets minimum public shareholding requirements. The company operates in the growing photovoltaic/solar power sector, which is aligned with India's renewable energy goals.
