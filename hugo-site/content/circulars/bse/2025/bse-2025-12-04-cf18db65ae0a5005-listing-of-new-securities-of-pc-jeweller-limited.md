- Issued to: Non-promoters on preferential basis

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed about the new securities listing
- All newly issued shares are subject to mandatory lock-in requirements
- Shares must remain locked-in until June 8, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: September 18, 2025
- **Trading Start Date**: December 5, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: June 8, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This preferential allotment significantly increases PC Jeweller's equity base. The issuance to non-promoters at Rs. 18/- per share may impact existing shareholder value through dilution. The nine-month lock-in period prevents immediate selling pressure but represents a substantial overhang once the lock-in expires in June 2026.

**Liquidity**: The shares will be tradable from December 5, 2025, but the complete set of newly issued shares remains locked until mid-2026, limiting immediate free float expansion.
