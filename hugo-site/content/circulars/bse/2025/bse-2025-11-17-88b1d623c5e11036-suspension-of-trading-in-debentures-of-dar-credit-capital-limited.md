---

## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in two series of Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) issued by DAR CREDIT & CAPITAL LIMITED effective November 25, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for early redemption of these debentures. Trading members are advised not to deal in these securities from the specified date.

## Key Points

- Two NCD series affected: DCCL-12.25%-10-2-26-PVT (ISIN: INE04Q907066, Code: 960472) and DCCL-NIFTY-10-2-26-PVT (ISIN: INE04Q907082, Code: 960473)
- Record date set for November 25, 2025
- Trading suspension begins November 25, 2025
- Purpose: Early redemption of NCDs
- Reference: DR-763/2025-2026
- Both are privately placed debentures

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard corporate action notification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease dealing in the specified debentures from November 25, 2025
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the trading suspension
- No transactions should be executed in these securities from the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **November 17, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 25, 2025**: Record date for early redemption
- **November 25, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of these two specific privately placed NCD series. The early redemption will affect investors holding these debentures as of the record date. Since these are private placements, the broader market impact is minimal. Trading members need to ensure compliance with the no-dealings directive to avoid regulatory issues.
