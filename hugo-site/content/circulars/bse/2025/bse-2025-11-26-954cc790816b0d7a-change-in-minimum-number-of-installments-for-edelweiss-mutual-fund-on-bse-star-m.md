**Operational Impact**: Fund documentation and systems will need updates to reflect new nomenclature. The change provides clearer distinction between regular and direct plans, potentially improving investor understanding of plan types.

**Compliance Impact**: Standard documentation amendments required. No material changes to scheme operations or regulatory compliance obligations.
