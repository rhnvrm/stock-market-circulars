## Summary

Tourism Finance Corporation of India Ltd (Scrip Code: 526650) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of Rs. 10 face value will be subdivided into five equity shares of Rs. 2 face value each, effective September 19, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Tourism Finance Corporation of India Ltd (Scrip Code: 526650)
- Record Date: September 19, 2025
- Sub-division ratio: 1 share of Rs. 10 becomes 5 shares of Rs. 2 each
- Current ISIN (INE305A01015) for Rs. 10 shares becomes invalid from September 19, 2025
- New ISIN for Rs. 2 shares to be announced separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE305A01015 for Rs. 10 paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after September 19, 2025. A new ISIN number for the Rs. 2 paid-up shares will be communicated through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note the change in share structure and ensure proper handling of transactions post-subdivision date. The company has set the record date for determining shareholders eligible for the sub-division.

## Important Dates

- Record Date: September 19, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The sub-division typically aims to improve liquidity and make shares more affordable for retail investors. Trading systems will need to be updated to reflect the new share structure and ISIN number.
