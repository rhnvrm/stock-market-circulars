## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium. The extension provides additional time for shareholders to participate in the Rights Issue, potentially increasing subscription rates. The 6-day extension is a procedural adjustment and does not change the fundamental terms of the issue.

**Shareholder Impact:** Positive for existing shareholders who need additional time to arrange funds or make decisions regarding their rights entitlement. Those who have already applied are unaffected.

**Operational Impact:** The subsequent timeline for allotment, credit, and listing has been adjusted accordingly, with the listing now expected around December 9, 2025 instead of the earlier anticipated date.

**Financial Impact:** The issue remains at face value (Re. 1.00 per share) with total proceeds up to Rs. 48.08 crores, unchanged from the original announcement.
