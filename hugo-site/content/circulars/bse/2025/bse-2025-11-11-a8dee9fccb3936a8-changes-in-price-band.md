## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 11, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The revised price bands will limit intraday price movements for these 10 securities, potentially reducing volatility but also constraining liquidity. Securities with 2% bands (3 stocks) will face the tightest trading constraints.

**Trading Impact**: Traders and investors in these securities will experience limited price discovery and reduced ability to enter/exit positions at desired prices during volatile periods. Algorithmic trading strategies may require adjustment.

**Surveillance Context**: Price band revisions typically indicate BSE's concern about unusual price movements or trading patterns in these securities, suggesting enhanced monitoring is warranted.
