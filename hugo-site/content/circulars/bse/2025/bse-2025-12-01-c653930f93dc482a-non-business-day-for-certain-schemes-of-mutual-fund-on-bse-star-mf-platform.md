## Summary

BSE has announced non-business days for certain mutual fund schemes on the BSE StAR MF Platform during December 2025. The circular covers schemes from six fund houses: Axis, Franklin, Kotak, Edelweiss, DSP, and Invesco. These non-business days primarily coincide with Christmas (December 24-26) and year-end holidays (December 31), affecting primarily international and fund-of-funds schemes.

- Franklin MF: 2 schemes affected (US Opportunities and European Opportunities feeder funds)
- Kotak MF: 3 schemes affected (US Specific Equity Passive, International REIT, Global Emerging Market)

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors should note that transactions in the specified mutual fund schemes will not be processed on the non-business days mentioned

- **December 25, 2025**: Non-business day for Axis (5 schemes), Franklin (2 schemes), Kotak (3 schemes), Edelweiss (all schemes), DSP (all schemes)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine operational notification that does not affect market trading or overall liquidity.

**Investor Impact**: Low. Investors in these specific mutual fund schemes should plan their transactions accordingly, avoiding the non-business days. The closures are primarily aligned with international market holidays, particularly affecting fund-of-funds and international schemes.

**Operational Impact**: Affects transaction processing for specified schemes only. BSE StAR MF platform and participating intermediaries need to ensure their systems reflect these non-business days to prevent transaction failures or rejections.
