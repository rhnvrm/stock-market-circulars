## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - affects 25 actively traded securities including major companies like Infosys, MRF, and Allcargo Logistics. The buyback and spin-off transactions require mandatory foreclosure, creating forced unwinding of SLB positions.

**Trading Impact:** SLB participants must close positions ahead of shut periods, potentially affecting liquidity and borrowing costs for these securities. The concentration of corporate actions between November 10-14 may create operational pressure on clearing systems.

**Investor Impact:** Beneficial owners holding shares through SLB arrangements must ensure positions are settled to receive corporate action benefits including dividends, buyback participation, and spin-off entitlements.

**Operational Impact:** Market intermediaries, custodians, and clearing corporations must process foreclosures systematically across 25 securities within compressed timeframes, particularly during the November 10-14 period when 18 securities are simultaneously affected.
