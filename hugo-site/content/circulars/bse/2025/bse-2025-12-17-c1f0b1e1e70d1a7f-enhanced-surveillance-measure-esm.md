## Summary

BSE has announced updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective December 18, 2025. Two new securities have been added to ESM Stage I: Supertech Ev Ltd (Scrip Code: 544428, ISIN: INE0SC101013) and Supra Trends Ltd (Scrip Code: 511539, ISIN: INE533B01028). No securities are moving to higher or lower ESM stages, and no securities are exiting the ESM framework.

## Key Points

- 2 new securities shortlisted in ESM framework Stage I
- Supertech Ev Ltd (SME scrip) added to ESM Stage I
- Supra Trends Ltd added to ESM Stage I
- No securities moving to higher ESM stages
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages
- No securities exiting ESM framework
- Changes effective from December 18, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework continues to monitor securities based on predefined criteria. Securities under ESM are subject to additional surveillance and trading restrictions to protect investor interests. The framework operates in multiple stages (Stage I being the initial level) with progressively stricter measures at higher stages.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the inclusion of these securities in ESM Stage I
- Enhanced surveillance measures apply to trading in these securities
- Market participants should exercise due diligence when trading ESM securities
- Securities in ESM framework may have additional reporting or disclosure requirements
- Trade-for-trade settlement may apply to ESM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 18, 2025 - ESM additions take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of two securities to ESM Stage I represents a limited scope impact affecting only those specific stocks. ESM inclusion typically results in reduced liquidity and increased scrutiny of trading activity.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ESM framework may experience:
- Additional price monitoring and surveillance
- Potential trade-for-trade settlement requirements
- Reduced speculative trading activity
- Enhanced disclosure requirements for significant price movements

**Investor Impact**: Investors in Supertech Ev Ltd and Supra Trends Ltd should be aware of enhanced surveillance status and exercise increased caution. The ESM framework is designed to protect investors by identifying securities with abnormal trading patterns or corporate governance concerns.
