Minimal market impact. This is a routine regulatory disclosure with no significant changes to the shareholding structure.

The presence of outstanding ESOPs (2,666,563 shares representing approximately 0.07% on diluted basis) indicates ongoing employee incentive programs but does not materially affect the overall shareholding pattern.
