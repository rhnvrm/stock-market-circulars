## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in Non-Convertible Debentures of SAMUNNATI FINANCE PRIVATE LIMITED effective November 20, 2025.

Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the suspension date.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures (INE551U07357) from November 20, 2025
- All exchange members must ensure compliance with the trading suspension
- Members should update their systems to prevent inadvertent trading in the suspended debentures

## Important Dates

- **November 17, 2025**: Notice issued by BSE
- **November 20, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **November 20, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date
- **December 5, 2025**: Implied maturity date based on debenture series name (SFPL-11.26%-5-12-25-PVT)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High for debenture holders. Investors holding these debentures will not be able to trade them from November 20, 2025. The suspension prevents any transfers that would affect eligibility for the final interest payment and redemption proceeds.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems block trading in this specific ISIN. Debenture holders eligible as of the record date will receive their redemption proceeds and final interest payment.

**Investor Impact**: Only investors holding the debentures as of November 20, 2025 will be entitled to redemption proceeds and interest payment. The 11.26% coupon rate suggests competitive returns, and redemption will return principal to investors.
