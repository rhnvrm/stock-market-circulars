title: Consolidated Penalties for Trading-Limit Violations and Position-Limit Violations
  Across Segments
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a consolidated summary of penalties applicable for trading limit violations (RRM violations) and position limit violations across multiple segments including Equity Cash, Equity Derivatives, Currency Derivatives, and Securities Lending & Borrowing. The circular standardizes penalty structures with escalating charges based on frequency of violations within a calendar month, ranging from 0.07% per day for first instances to cumulative penalties plus referral to Member Committee from the 11th instance onwards.

## Key Points

- Trading limit violations attract 0.07% per day penalty plus additional fixed charges based on violation frequency
- Penalty structure differentiates between violations ≤ Rs 1 crore and > Rs 1 crore
- From 11th instance onwards, violating members are referred to Member Committee for suitable action
- Position limit violations for Equity Derivatives: 1% of violation value (min Rs 5,000, max Rs 1,00,000 per entity per stock per day)
- Currency Derivatives position limit violations: no penalty for 1st instance, escalating penalties for subsequent violations
- Client-level position limit violations in Currency Derivatives: Rs 5,000 per violation per client per day
- Penalties collected from clearing members who may recover amounts from violating clients
- Ban period position violations attract 1% of violation value with specified minimum and maximum limits

## Regulatory Changes

This is a consolidation circular providing a unified summary of existing penalty frameworks. No new regulatory changes are introduced; the circular serves as an informational reference for members.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with trading limits (RRM) across all segments
- Position limits must be monitored at trading member, FPI, mutual fund, and client levels
- Clearing members are responsible for penalty payment and may recover from violating clients
- Members must maintain vigilance to avoid multiple violations leading to Member Committee referral
- Specific monitoring required for ban period positions to avoid enhanced penalties

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 24, 2025
- **Effective Date:** Immediate (consolidation of existing penalty structures)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a consolidation circular that does not change existing penalty structures or introduce new regulations.

**Operational Impact:** Medium for trading and clearing members - Provides clear reference framework for penalty calculations, enabling better risk management and violation tracking. Members can now easily reference consolidated penalty structures across segments rather than referring to multiple circulars.

**Financial Impact:** Members with repeated violations face escalating penalties and potential Member Committee action from 11th instance onwards. Clearing members bear initial penalty liability with recovery rights from violating clients.
