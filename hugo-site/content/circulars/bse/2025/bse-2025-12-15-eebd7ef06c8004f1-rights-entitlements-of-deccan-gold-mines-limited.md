## Summary

BSE has announced that trading in Rights Entitlements (REs) for renunciation of Deccan Gold Mines Limited will be permitted from December 17, 2025 to December 22, 2025. The rights issue itself will remain open from December 17, 2025 to December 26, 2025. The REs will be traded in dematerialized form only on T+1 rolling settlement basis with trade-for-trade settlement.

## Key Points

- Rights Entitlements trading permitted from Wednesday, December 17, 2025 to Monday, December 22, 2025
- Scrip Code: 751066, Scrip ID: DECNGO-RE, ISIN: INE945F20017
- Market lot: 1, Group: R
- REs tradable in dematerialized form only
- Settlement on T+1 rolling settlement basis
- Trade-for-trade settlement applies
- Rights Issue open period: December 17-26, 2025
- REs that are neither subscribed nor renounced before issue closing date will lapse and be extinguished

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular operationalizes existing framework for rights entitlements trading as per previous notices dated March 05, 2020 (notice no-20200305-21) and May 18, 2020 (notice no-20200518-34).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform all clients about commencement of trading in REs, mentioning the ISIN (INE945F20017)
- Trading members must clarify that REs should not be mistaken for ordinary shares
- Contract notes/bills for RE purchases must include prominent disclaimer informing clients that:
  - Purchase of REs only gives right to participate in the ongoing rights issue by making application with requisite money OR renounce the REs before issue closes
  - REs that are neither subscribed nor renounced on or before issue closing date will lapse and be extinguished
- Trading members should refer to notice no-20200305-21 (March 05, 2020) and notice no-20200518-34 (May 18, 2020) for further details

## Important Dates

- **December 15, 2025**: Notice date
- **December 17, 2025**: RE trading period begins; Rights Issue opens
- **December 22, 2025**: RE trading period ends
- **December 26, 2025**: Rights Issue closes

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Limited to shareholders of Deccan Gold Mines Limited who hold rights entitlements and wish to either trade them or participate in the rights issue.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure proper client communication regarding RE trading mechanics, settlement processes, and the distinction between REs and ordinary equity shares. The 6-day RE trading window (Dec 17-22) provides adequate opportunity for renunciation before the rights issue closes on December 26.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders must decide within the specified timeframe whether to exercise their rights, sell their entitlements, or let them lapse. Failure to act before December 26, 2025 will result in permanent loss of rights entitlements.
