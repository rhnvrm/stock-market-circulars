## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt instrument listing with minimal market-wide impact. The listing adds short-term debt securities to the BSE Debt segment, providing institutional investors and trading members with additional investment options in highly-rated commercial paper (CRISIL A1+). The relatively small issue size of Rs. 10 crore and short tenure (approximately 4 months) indicate this is a standard working capital financing instrument. Impact is limited to debt market participants and does not affect equity markets or broader trading operations.
