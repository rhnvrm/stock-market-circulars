## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. These are standard surveillance clarifications where companies confirm regulatory compliance and absence of undisclosed material information. The volume increases mentioned appear to be market-driven rather than related to corporate developments. No new information disclosed that would affect trading or investor decisions. This is routine exchange surveillance activity to ensure market integrity.
