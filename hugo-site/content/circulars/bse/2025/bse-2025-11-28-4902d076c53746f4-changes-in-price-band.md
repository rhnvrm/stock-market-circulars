title: Changes in Price Band for 31 Securities Effective December 1, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced revisions to price bands for 31 securities, effective December 1, 2025. The revised bands range from 2% to 20%, down from their existing levels, indicating increased surveillance measures. The affected securities include companies across various sectors, with most being subject to tighter trading restrictions. Trading members have been notified to implement these changes from the effective date.

## Key Points

- 31 securities will have revised price bands effective December 1, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 20%
- Most securities (18 out of 31) will have a 5% price band
- 4 securities restricted to 2% price band (most stringent): Alan Scott Enterprises, Emergent Industrial Solutions
- 5 securities have 10% price bands: Captain Technocast, Gilada Finance, Trescon, Tuni Textile Mills, Varvee Global
- 1 security (Oceanic Foods) has the widest 20% price band among affected stocks
- Changes apply to equity segment trading

## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions are a surveillance measure used by BSE to control excessive volatility and protect investors. The tightening of price bands from existing levels suggests these securities are under enhanced surveillance, potentially due to:

- Unusual price movements
- Low liquidity
- Corporate governance concerns
- Compliance issues
- Other risk factors requiring closer monitoring

The varying levels of restrictions (2%, 5%, 10%, 20%) indicate different risk profiles across the affected securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands from December 1, 2025
- All trades in affected securities must comply with new price band limits
- Members should update their trading systems and risk management tools accordingly
- Investors should be aware that these securities will have limited intraday price movement
- For clarifications, members may contact BSE at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 28, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 1, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The tightened price bands will significantly restrict intraday volatility in these 31 securities, potentially reducing trading volumes and liquidity. Investors holding these stocks will face limitations on price discovery and may experience difficulty in executing large orders.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may face challenges in exiting positions quickly due to restricted price movements. New investors should exercise caution as tighter price bands often signal underlying concerns about the securities.

**Trading Impact**: Day traders and short-term traders will find these securities less attractive due to limited price movement. The 2% price band stocks (Alan Scott Enterprises, Emergent Industrial Solutions) will be particularly illiquid with minimal intraday trading opportunities.

**Surveillance Indicator**: This circular serves as a warning signal that these companies are under enhanced surveillance, suggesting potential fundamental or compliance issues that warrant investor caution.
