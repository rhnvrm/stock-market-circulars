## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium impact on existing shareholders of U. H. ZAVERI LIMITED who wish to trade their rights entitlements. The short trading window (5 days) requires prompt action from investors who want to renounce their rights. The trade-for-trade settlement and dematerialized form requirement ensure transparent and secure transactions. Trading members need to ensure proper client communication to avoid confusion between REs and ordinary shares, and to prevent inadvertent lapsing of valuable rights.
