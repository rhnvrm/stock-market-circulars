## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. The listing involves a small number of shares (50,421) relative to Havells India's total outstanding equity, issued under employee benefit schemes. The 12-month lock-in period prevents immediate trading by employees, further limiting any potential price impact. This is a routine corporate action with no implications for broader market operations or trading strategies.
