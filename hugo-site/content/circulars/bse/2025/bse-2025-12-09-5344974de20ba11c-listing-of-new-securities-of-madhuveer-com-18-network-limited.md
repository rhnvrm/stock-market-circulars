## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to a single company's preferential allotment. The 10,00,000 shares represent additional equity capital raised through warrant conversion, issued to Promoters. The complete lock-in until October 31, 2027 means these shares will not be available for trading during this period, limiting any immediate impact on stock liquidity or price. This is a routine corporate action relevant primarily to the company's shareholders and trading members tracking the scrip.
