## Summary

SEBI has issued clarifications on digital accessibility requirements for regulated entities (REs) under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. The circular modifies earlier requirements issued in July-September 2025, extending the accessibility auditor appointment deadline and establishing a new compliance framework. Key changes include: submission of readiness status by March 31, 2026 instead of auditor appointment by December 14, 2025; inclusion of digital accessibility rights in investor charters; establishment of accessibility complaint mechanism through SCORES; and mandatory periodic accessibility audits by certified professionals.

## Key Points

- Deadline for accessibility auditor appointment (previously December 14, 2025) replaced with readiness status submission requirement by March 31, 2026
- REs must submit compliance status for each digital platform to specified reporting authorities
- Stock Brokers and Depository Participants report to Stock Exchanges/Depositories
- Investment Advisors and Research Analysts report to BSE Ltd.
- 15 categories of REs (including AIFs, MFs, AMCs, Stock Exchanges, Depositories, CRAs, etc.) report directly to SEBI

## Impact Assessment

**Market-Wide Impact**: This circular affects the entire securities market ecosystem, covering stock exchanges, clearing corporations, depositories, all categories of intermediaries, mutual funds, portfolio managers, and other regulated entities. The compliance burden is significant as it requires assessment and potential remediation of all digital touchpoints.

**Investor Protection**: Strengthens rights of persons with disabilities by formally incorporating digital accessibility into investor charters and establishing clear complaint redressal mechanism through SCORES. This represents a fundamental shift toward inclusive digital platforms in the securities market.

**Operational Impact**: 
- REs must audit existing digital infrastructure for accessibility compliance
- Potential need for platform redesign or updates to meet accessibility standards
- Ongoing cost of periodic audits by certified professionals
- Need to establish internal processes for handling accessibility complaints
- Extended timeline (to March 31, 2026) provides more preparation time than original December 2025 deadline

**Compliance Complexity**: Different reporting channels for different entity types may create coordination challenges. However, the structured approach with designated reporting authorities should streamline oversight.

**Legal Framework**: Issued under Section 11(1) of SEBI Act 1992 with approval of Competent Authority, ensuring strong regulatory backing for enforcement.
