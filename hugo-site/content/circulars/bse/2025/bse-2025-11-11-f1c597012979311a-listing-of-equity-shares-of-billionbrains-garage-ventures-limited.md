## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - This is a new listing on BSE with a substantial number of shares (617+ crore shares). The significant lock-in periods for most shares (approximately 94% under lock-in) will limit immediate tradable float, potentially affecting liquidity.

**Investor Impact**: ESOP holders benefit from no lock-in on 8.15 crore shares, providing immediate liquidity. IPO public investors holding 8.15 crore shares also have no lock-in restrictions. Promoters and long-term investors face lock-in periods up to 18 months.

**Operational Impact**: The company's registered office is in Bengaluru's Vaishnavi Tech Park. The mix of physical and demat shares requires careful tracking of distinctive numbers for compliance and transfer purposes.
