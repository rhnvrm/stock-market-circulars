## Summary

DSP Mutual Fund has announced a two-day extension to the New Fund Offer (NFO) period of DSP MSCI India ETF, an open-ended scheme that replicates/tracks the MSCI India Index. The NFO originally scheduled to close on November 17, 2025, will now close on November 19, 2025. This notice serves as an addendum to the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM).

## Key Points

- DSP MSCI India ETF is an open-ended scheme tracking the MSCI India Index
- NFO commenced on November 10, 2025
- Original closing date was November 17, 2025
- Extended by two days to November 19, 2025
- Notice issued by DSP Asset Managers Private Limited on November 11, 2025
- This change forms an integral part of the SID and KIM of the scheme

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an administrative modification to the NFO timeline, overriding conflicting provisions in the original SID and KIM while keeping all other provisions unchanged.

## Compliance Requirements

- Unit holders are requested to update their PAN, KYC, email address, mobile number, and nominee details with the AMC
- Unit holders are advised to link their PAN with Aadhaar Number
- Unit holders can check for unclaimed redemptions, IDCW payments, or inactive folios on the Fund's website

## Important Dates

- **NFO Start Date**: November 10, 2025

- **Revised NFO Close Date**: November 19, 2025 (extended by 2 days)

## Impact Assessment

The extension has minimal market impact as it only affects prospective investors considering this specific ETF scheme. The two-day extension provides additional time for investors to subscribe to the NFO. This is a routine administrative action common in mutual fund launches and does not indicate any operational issues or market concerns. The scheme will track the MSCI India Index, providing investors with broad-based exposure to Indian equities.
