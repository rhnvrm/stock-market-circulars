## Impact Assessment

This is a standard anchor investor allocation process as part of Mother Nutri Foods Limited's public issue. The anchor allocation represents institutional confidence in the IPO. The absence of domestic mutual fund participation is notable but not uncommon in smaller IPOs. The allocation to foreign institutional investors (Mauritius-based funds) indicates international interest in the company. This information is primarily relevant for retail investors considering participation in the public issue and for tracking institutional investment patterns.
