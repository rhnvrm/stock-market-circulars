title: Non-Competitive Bidding for Auction of GoI dated Securities (G-secs) on December
  26, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE announces non-competitive bidding facility for the RBI auction of three Government of India dated securities scheduled for December 26, 2025. The auction includes re-issuance of three G-secs with varying maturities (2028, 2032, and 2055) totaling Rs. 32,000 crores. Trading members and direct investors can participate through BSE's iBBS web-based NCB-GSec module with specific bid collection timelines.

## Key Points

- Three GoI dated securities available for auction: 5.91% GS 2028, 6.28% GS 2032, and 7.24% GS 2055
- Total issue size: Rs. 32,000 crores (Rs. 9,000 cr + Rs. 11,000 cr + Rs. 12,000 cr)
- All three securities are re-issues, not new issuances
- Minimum subscription unit: 100 with minimum amount Rs. 10,000
- Maximum bidding amount: Rs. 2 crores per security
- Bidding available through BSE's iBBS NCB-GSec module at https://ibbs.bseindia.com
- Reference to earlier circular 20180423-42 dated April 23, 2018 regarding non-competitive bidding facility

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular operationalizes the existing non-competitive bidding framework established in April 2018 for the current auction cycle.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must submit bids through the NCB-GSec module of BSE's iBBS platform
- Members must adhere to specified bid collection timelines (different for members vs. direct investors)
- Minimum subscription units and amounts must be followed
- Maximum bidding limit of Rs. 2 crores per security applies
- Settlement obligations must be met on the settlement date

## Important Dates

- **December 23, 2025, 10:00 AM**: Bid collection starts (24-hour availability)
- **December 25, 2025, 5:00 PM**: Bid collection end date for Direct Investors
- **December 26, 2025, 8:00 AM**: Bid collection end date for Trading Members
- **December 26, 2025**: Auction date
- **December 29, 2025**: Settlement date

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine government securities auction with moderate market significance. The Rs. 32,000 crore offering across three maturities provides liquidity opportunities in the debt market. The non-competitive bidding facility allows smaller investors and trading members to participate in government securities auctions without competing on price, democratizing access to sovereign debt instruments. Settlement through standard T+3 timeline (December 29, 2025) ensures normal market operations. Impact is primarily on debt market participants, fixed-income investors, and treasury operations of financial institutions.
