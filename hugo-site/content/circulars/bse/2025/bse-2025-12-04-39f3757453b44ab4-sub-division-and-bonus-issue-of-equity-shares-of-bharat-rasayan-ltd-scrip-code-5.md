## Important Dates

- **Document Submission Deadline**: December 15, 2025 by 12:00 PM
- **Trading of Bonus Shares**: December 16, 2025 (Tuesday) onwards

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their shareholding double after both actions complete. Each share of ₹10 will become 2 shares of ₹5, then bonus issue will add another share for each post-split share, resulting in 4 shares of ₹5 for every original share of ₹10.

**Market Impact**: The sub-division and bonus issue will significantly improve liquidity by quadrupling the number of shares outstanding. The lower face value and increased float should make the stock more accessible to retail investors.

**Trading Impact**: Stock price will adjust downward proportionately on ex-date. Futures and options contracts will undergo adjustment. Higher trading volumes expected due to increased liquidity.

**Capital Structure**: Total share capital increases from ₹4,15,52,680 to ₹8,31,05,360 in value terms, while the number of shares increases from 83,10,536 to 1,66,21,072.
