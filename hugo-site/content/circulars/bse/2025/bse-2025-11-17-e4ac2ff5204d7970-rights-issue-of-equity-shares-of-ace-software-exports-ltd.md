## Summary

ACE SOFTWARE EXPORTS LTD. (BSE Code: 531525) has announced a rights issue where existing shareholders can subscribe to 3 new equity shares for every 7 equity shares held. The shares are priced at Rs. 110 per share (face value Rs. 10 with premium of Rs. 100). The record date is set for November 20, 2025, and trading will be done on ex-rights basis from the same date.

## Key Points

- Rights entitlement: 3 equity shares for every 7 equity shares held
- Issue price: Rs. 110 per share (Rs. 10 face value + Rs. 100 premium)
- Payment structure: Rs. 49.50 on application and Rs. 60.50 on subsequent call(s)
- Ex-rights trading begins: November 20, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-760/2025-2026)
- Company code: 531525 (BSE)
- Segment: Dematerialised Securities - Rolling Settlement

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action notification under existing rights issue framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure all transactions in ACE SOFTWARE EXPORTS LTD. equity shares are conducted on ex-rights basis from November 20, 2025
- Trading systems must be adjusted to reflect the ex-rights status effective from the specified date
- Members need to inform clients about their rights entitlements based on holdings as of the record date

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: November 20, 2025 - Shareholders on this date are eligible for rights issue
- **Ex-Rights Date**: November 20, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-760/2025-2026) - Trading begins on ex-rights basis
- **Notice Date**: November 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The rights issue will dilute existing shareholding for those who don't participate. The issue is priced at a significant premium (Rs. 100 over face value of Rs. 10), indicating confidence in the company's prospects. Trading on ex-rights basis from November 20, 2025 means the stock price will adjust to reflect the rights offering.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders as of the record date have the opportunity to maintain their proportional ownership by subscribing to the rights issue. The staggered payment structure (application money and subsequent calls) provides flexibility in fund deployment.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and processes to handle ex-rights trading and inform clients about their entitlements.
