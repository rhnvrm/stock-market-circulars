**Liquidity Considerations**: A substantial portion of the shares are under lock-in restrictions, which will significantly limit the free float available for trading in the initial months. The staggered lock-in release dates (December 2025, February 2026, May 2026, and May 2027) will gradually increase liquidity over 18 months.

**Investor Categories**: The listing includes diverse investor categories including anchor investors, promoters/early investors (long lock-ins), ESOP beneficiaries, and AIFs with varying lock-in requirements, reflecting a well-structured IPO allocation.

**Compliance**: Lock-in details are provided as per pages 193-196 of the Company's Prospectus and comply with SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2018.
