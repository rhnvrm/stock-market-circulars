## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to medium - affects only existing shareholders of TITAN INTECH LIMITED who hold rights entitlements. The short renunciation window (5 days) requires prompt action from shareholders wishing to trade their REs.

**Operational Impact:** Medium for brokers and trading members who must ensure proper client communication, disclaimer inclusion in contract notes, and T+1 settlement processing for RE trades. The trade-for-trade settlement mechanism requires careful tracking of each transaction.

**Investor Impact:** Medium for TITAN INTECH shareholders - provides opportunity to monetize rights through renunciation if they do not wish to subscribe to the Rights Issue. Critical deadline awareness required to avoid lapse of valuable entitlements.
