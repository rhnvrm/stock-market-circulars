## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine administrative circular that enables normal market operations.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Market participants, custodians, and clearing members must plan their operations according to this schedule. Critical for smooth settlement operations but does not affect trading activity or market structure.

**Participant Impact:** All cash segment participants need to align their back-office operations, fund management, and settlement processes with the published schedule. Particularly important for institutional investors and custodians managing large volumes of settlements.
