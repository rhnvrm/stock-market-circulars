## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** November 07, 2025
- **Circular Date:** November 06, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The addition of 7 securities to ST-ASM framework indicates increased surveillance on these stocks due to price volatility or other market concerns. This will result in stricter trading conditions including potential margin requirements, trade-for-trade settlement, or price bands.

**Trading Impact:** Investors and traders in the affected securities will face additional restrictions designed to curb excessive speculation and protect market integrity. The removal of 4 securities from the framework suggests improved compliance or reduced volatility concerns.

**Investor Impact:** Existing holders of newly added securities may experience reduced liquidity and higher transaction costs. The measure is preventive and aims to protect retail investors from excessive volatility in these securities.
