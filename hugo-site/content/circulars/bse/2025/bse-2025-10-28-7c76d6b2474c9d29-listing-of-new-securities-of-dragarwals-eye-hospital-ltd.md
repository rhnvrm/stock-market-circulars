## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The preferential allotment to promoters represents a capital raising exercise with minimal immediate market impact. The shares are locked-in until April 2027, preventing any selling pressure on the stock price.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible in the short term due to the lock-in period. The 1,32,827 shares will only become tradable after April 29, 2027.

**Corporate Impact**: The Rs. 70.03 crore capital raised (1,32,827 shares × Rs. 5,270) strengthens the company's equity base and may be used for business expansion or other corporate purposes.

**Investor Considerations**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution from the preferential allotment, though the lock-in period provides stability by preventing immediate promoter selling.
