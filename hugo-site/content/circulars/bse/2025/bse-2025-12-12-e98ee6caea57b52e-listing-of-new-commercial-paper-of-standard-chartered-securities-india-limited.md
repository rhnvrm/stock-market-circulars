## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it is a routine commercial paper listing in the debt segment. The instrument provides short-term funding for Standard Chartered Securities (India) Limited with a one-year maturity. The ICRA A1+ rating indicates high credit quality. Impact is limited to institutional investors and trading members participating in debt market transactions. The standard denomination of Rs. 5 lakhs restricts participation to institutional and high-net-worth investors.
