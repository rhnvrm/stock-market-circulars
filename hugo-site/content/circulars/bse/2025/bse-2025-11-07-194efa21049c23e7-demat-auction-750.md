BSE has published the list of securities and quantities under demat auction for Settlement No. 750 dated November 7, 2025. The auction includes 103 scrips across various sectors with quantities ranging from 1 to over 5.7 million shares. This is a routine clearing and settlement operation to fulfill delivery obligations where securities were not delivered by the selling broker.

## Key Points

- Settlement Date: November 7, 2025
- Total number of scrips: 103 securities
- Includes major stocks like STANDARD CAP (5,750,963 shares), TATA POWER (6,409 shares), TATA STEEL (4,996 shares)
- Covers diverse sectors including banking, pharma, IT, infrastructure, consumer goods
- Quantities range from 1 share to over 5 million shares depending on the security

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced by this circular. This is a standard operational auction notice as per existing clearing and settlement regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members involved in the settlement must participate in the demat auction process
- Members with short delivery positions must arrange securities or participate in the auction
- Buyers expecting delivery should note potential delays due to auction process
- Settlement obligations must be fulfilled as per BSE clearing corporation guidelines

## Important Dates

- **Settlement Date**: November 7, 2025
- **Settlement Number**: 750
- Auction execution and settlement will follow standard BSE timelines for demat auctions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects trading members and clients with delivery obligations in 103 securities. While routine, the large quantity in some scrips (notably STANDARD CAP with 5.75 million shares) could impact specific stock liquidity temporarily.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and clients with positions in these securities need to monitor auction outcomes. Failed deliveries will be closed out through this auction mechanism, potentially at prices different from original trade prices.

**Investor Impact**: Clients expecting delivery of these securities may experience delays. Those with short positions will have their obligations closed through the auction process with potential mark-to-market losses.
