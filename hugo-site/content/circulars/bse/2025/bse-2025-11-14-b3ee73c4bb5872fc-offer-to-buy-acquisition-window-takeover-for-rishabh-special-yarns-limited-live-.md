## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market-wide impact as it pertains specifically to shareholders of Rishabh Special Yarns Limited. The offer provides an exit opportunity for shareholders at Rs. 13.00 per share. Trading Members and Custodian Members facilitating client participation need to ensure proper UCC registration and demat account status. The scrip being listed only on Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India further limits the scope of impact to a specific investor base.
