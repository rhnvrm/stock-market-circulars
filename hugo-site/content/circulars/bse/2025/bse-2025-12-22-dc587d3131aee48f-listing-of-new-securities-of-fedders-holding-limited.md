- **Allotment Date:** October 18, 2025
- **Trading Commencement:** December 23, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine preferential allotment with minimal market impact. The issuance of 2,00,000 shares represents a small capital raise through warrant conversion. The lock-in period until July 30, 2026 ensures these shares cannot be traded immediately, preventing sudden supply pressure. The shares carry the same rights as existing equity shares, maintaining equity structure consistency. This is a standard corporate action with limited operational or market-wide implications.
