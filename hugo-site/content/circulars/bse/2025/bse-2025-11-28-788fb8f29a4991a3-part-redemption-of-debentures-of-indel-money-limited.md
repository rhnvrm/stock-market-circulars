## Impact Assessment

This corporate action has moderate impact limited to holders of INDEL MONEY LIMITED's specific debenture series (IML-13%-25-11-27-PVT). The part redemption will return capital to debenture holders while reducing the outstanding principal amount. The face value reduction from the original amount to Rs. 80,000 per debenture will affect future interest calculations and trading valuation. Market liquidity for this security may be temporarily affected during the transition period. Trading members need to update systems to handle the reduced face value for accurate pricing and settlement.
