title: Changes in Price Band for 13 Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for 13 securities effective December 24, 2025. The revised price bands range from 2% to 10%, representing tighter trading limits for these scrips. This action is taken under BSE's surveillance mechanism to control excessive volatility.

## Key Points

- 13 securities will have revised price bands from December 24, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 10%
- Three scrips get 2% band: Alps Industries, Galada Power, Seshachal Technologies, SSPN Finance, and Triton Corp
- Five scrips get 5% band: Manaksia Steels, Meesho, Parshva Enterprises, Rachit Prints, Sonal Mercantile, and TCI Finance
- Two scrips get 10% band: Octaware Technologies and PH Capital
- Notice issued by BSE Surveillance Department

## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions represent enhanced surveillance measures under BSE's market supervision framework. Tighter price bands (2% and 5%) restrict daily price movements, reducing speculative trading activity. The 10% band represents standard market conditions for controlled monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands in their systems before market opening on December 24, 2025
- All orders must comply with new price band limits
- Queries should be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 23, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The revised price bands will limit intraday price movements for these 13 securities. Scrips with 2% bands will face the most restrictive trading environment, potentially reducing liquidity but protecting against excessive volatility. Investors in these securities should adjust their trading strategies to accommodate the tighter price movement limits. The measure aims to stabilize price discovery and reduce speculative excess in these specific counters.
