## Summary

BSE has approved the listing of 3,50,000 equity shares of Shri Gang Industries & Allied Products Limited (Scrip Code: 523309) issued to non-promoters on a preferential basis. These shares were issued pursuant to conversion of Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS) and will commence trading on Monday, October 20, 2025. The shares are subject to a lock-in period until January 2, 2026.

## Key Points

- 3,50,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each issued at a premium of Rs. 66/-
- Issue price: Rs. 76/- per share
- Allotted to non-promoters on preferential basis
- Issued pursuant to conversion of Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares
- ISIN: INE241V01018
- Distinctive Numbers: 17930001 to 18280000
- Date of allotment: September 3, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following SEBI preferential allotment norms.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the new securities in their systems
- Lock-in restrictions must be enforced until January 2, 2026
- All 3,50,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 17930001 to 18280000) are subject to lock-in

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** September 3, 2025
- **Trading Commencement:** October 20, 2025 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Expiry:** January 2, 2026
- **Circular Date:** October 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The preferential allotment represents a relatively small number of shares issued at Rs. 76/- per share, totaling approximately Rs. 2.66 crores. The lock-in period until January 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible immediate impact on trading liquidity as shares are locked-in for over two months from listing date.

**Corporate Action:** This represents dilution through conversion of preference shares, but issued to non-promoters, suggesting capital raising or restructuring activity. Investors should monitor the company's utilization of these funds and overall capital structure changes.
