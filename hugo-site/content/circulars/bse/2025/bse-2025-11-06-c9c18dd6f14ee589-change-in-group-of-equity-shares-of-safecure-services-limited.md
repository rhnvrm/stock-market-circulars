## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - This transition from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment typically occurs after SME IPO stocks complete their initial listing period. The change will increase liquidity and trading flexibility as the stock moves from mandatory delivery-based trading to normal rolling settlement.

**Trading Impact:** Positive for liquidity - Investors will be able to conduct intraday trading and will not be required to take/give mandatory delivery for every trade. This usually leads to increased trading volumes and better price discovery.

**Investor Impact:** The shift to M Group indicates the stock is graduating from the restrictive Trade for Trade mechanism, which is generally viewed positively as it suggests the exchange considers the stock ready for normal trading operations.
