**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine listing of preferential allotment shares. The 50 lakh shares represent additional equity issued to non-promoters through warrant conversion.

**Trading Impact:** Minimal immediate impact as all 50 lakh shares are subject to lock-in until June 30, 2026, preventing them from being traded in the market during this period.

**Shareholding Impact:** Dilution to existing shareholders as 50 lakh new shares have been issued to non-promoters, though the full impact depends on the total outstanding share capital of the company.
