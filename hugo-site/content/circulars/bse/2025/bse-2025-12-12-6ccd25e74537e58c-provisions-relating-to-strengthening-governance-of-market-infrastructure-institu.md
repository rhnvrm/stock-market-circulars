## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
This circular represents a significant structural change to governance of all Market Infrastructure Institutions in India. The phenomenal growth in securities markets has amplified the critical role of MIIs to act primarily in public interest, making robust governance essential to prevent adverse impacts on markets and the broader economy.

**Operational Impact:**
- MIIs must restructure executive management to create two new ED positions
- Enhanced oversight through dual reporting (EDs to MD, and ED Vertical 1 to SCOT independently)
- Increased accountability with EDs as Governing Board members
- Greater regulatory scrutiny with mandatory SEBI approval for appointments and compensation

**Institutional Impact:**
- Strengthened governance through separation of critical operations from regulatory/compliance functions
- Improved checks and balances with independent SCOT oversight of critical operations
- Enhanced succession planning requirements
- Greater transparency through open advertisement mandates

**Compliance Burden:**
- MIIs must implement new recruitment processes
- Additional approval workflows for compensation changes
- Enhanced performance evaluation systems
- Regular quarterly reporting requirements

**Flexibility Provisions:**
SEBI has recognized that MIIs vary in size, financial health and growth stage, allowing exemption requests for those facing genuine practical difficulties. This case-by-case approach balances regulatory objectives with operational realities.
