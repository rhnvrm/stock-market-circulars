## Impact Assessment

**Market Operations Impact**: Medium - affects liquidity in SLB segment for 23 securities across multiple sectors including PSUs, IT, FMCG, infrastructure, and manufacturing.

**Trading Impact**: SLB participants must close positions before foreclosure dates to avoid mandatory closure at potentially unfavorable rates. Heavy concentration of foreclosures in third week of November may temporarily reduce SLB availability.

**Sector Coverage**: Diversified impact across Oil & Gas (ONGC), Railways (RITES, IRCTC, CONCOR), Defense/Shipbuilding (Cochin Shipyard), Consumer (Asian Paints, Page Industries), Infrastructure (IRB, NBCC, Adani Enterprises), Mining (MOIL), and Auto components (Gabriel India, Jamna Auto, Banco Products).

**Rights Issue Note**: Adani Enterprises rights issue requires special attention as it involves equity dilution, not just dividend distribution. SLB positions must be closed by foreclosure date November 17, 2025.
