These shares were issued to promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to warrant conversion at an issue price of Rs. 29.84 per share (Rs. 10 face value + Rs. 19.84 premium). The entire allotment is subject to lock-in until December 31, 2027.

## Key Points

- Total shares listed: 13,14,08,514 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for preferential allotment under existing SEBI regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the listing of new securities for trading from December 26, 2025
- All 13,14,08,514 shares are subject to mandatory lock-in restrictions
- Lock-in period compliance must be maintained by the allottees (promoters)

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date (Tranche 1)**: March 18, 2025 - 12,42,18,051 shares (Dist. Nos. 1281988654-1406206704)
- **Allotment Date (Tranche 2)**: March 19, 2025 - 71,90,463 shares (Dist. Nos. 1406206705-1413397167)
- **Trading Commencement**: December 26, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: December 31, 2027

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing represents a substantial equity dilution through preferential allotment to promoters. However, the 3-year lock-in period (until December 31, 2027) means these shares cannot be traded in the near term, limiting immediate supply-side pressure on the stock price.

**Promoter Impact**: This warrant conversion indicates capital infusion by promoters, potentially strengthening the company's financial position and demonstrating promoter confidence in SpiceJet's prospects.

**Investor Consideration**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution impact on their holdings, though the locked-in nature of these shares provides stability. The premium of Rs. 19.84 over face value (total Rs. 29.84) may serve as a reference point for valuation considerations.
