## Impact Assessment

This listing brings K K Silk Mills Limited's equity shares to the BSE platform. With approximately 27.4% of shares (61.56 lakh) freely tradable and the remaining 72.6% under lock-in for 1-3 years, initial trading liquidity will be limited. The staggered lock-in release schedule will gradually increase float availability over the next three years, potentially impacting price discovery and volatility. This structure is typical for IPO listings where promoter and early investor holdings are subject to regulatory lock-in requirements.
