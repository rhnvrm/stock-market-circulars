## Summary

BSE has updated the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective October 29, 2025. Five securities are being newly shortlisted under the ST-ASM framework, while six securities are moving out of the framework. No securities are being moved to higher or lower stage ASM during this update. The ST-ASM framework is designed to enhance market safety by applying additional surveillance on securities exhibiting abnormal price movements.

## Key Points

- 5 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework
- 6 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework
- No securities moving to higher stage ASM
- No securities moving to lower stage ASM
- Changes effective from October 29, 2025
- Several securities moving out due to inclusion in other surveillance frameworks (ESM Framework)

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to operate with its existing structure of 5/15/30 days stages. Securities under this framework are subject to enhanced surveillance due to unusual price movements or trading patterns. The framework works in conjunction with other surveillance measures including Long Term ASM (LT-ASM), Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM), Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM), Trade for Trade, and Pledge Framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the updated list of securities under ST-ASM framework
- Enhanced surveillance and monitoring required for listed securities
- Margin and position limit requirements apply as per ST-ASM framework rules
- Investors should be aware of additional trading restrictions on these securities
- Price band and other trading parameters may be adjusted for securities under surveillance

## Important Dates

- **October 29, 2025**: Effective date for all changes to ST-ASM framework
- Securities will be subject to ST-ASM trading rules from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to specific securities listed; no broad market impact expected. The addition of 5 securities and removal of 6 securities represents routine surveillance framework adjustments.

**Trading Impact**: Securities entering ST-ASM framework will face enhanced surveillance including potential restrictions on intraday trading, higher margins, and stricter price bands. This may reduce liquidity and increase volatility in affected scrips.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance measures that may affect trading flexibility and margin requirements. Securities moving to ESM framework face even stricter surveillance measures.

**SME Segment**: 3 out of 5 securities entering ST-ASM are from the SME segment, indicating heightened volatility concerns in smaller companies.
