## Important Dates

- **October 14, 2025**: Circular announcement date
- **October 28, 2025**: Existing ISIN (INE258A01016) becomes invalid for exchange transactions
- **November 3, 2025**: Record date for sub-division
- **November 3, 2025**: Effective date for new face value of Rs. 5/-

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The stock sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by splitting each share into two. This typically improves liquidity and makes the stock more accessible to retail investors by reducing the per-share price.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive twice the number of shares they currently hold, with each new share having half the face value. The total value of their holdings remains unchanged immediately after the split.

**Trading Impact**: The existing ISIN will cease to be valid from October 28, 2025, requiring all market participants to transition to the new ISIN. A separate notice will inform the market of the new ISIN number for Rs. 5/- paid-up shares.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and depository participants must update their systems to reflect the new face value, adjust share quantities in shareholder accounts, and ensure seamless transition to the new ISIN.
