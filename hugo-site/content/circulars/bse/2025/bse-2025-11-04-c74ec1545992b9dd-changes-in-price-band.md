## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** November 4, 2025
- **Effective Date:** November 6, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Limited to specific scrips; most are small-cap or less-liquid securities. Broader market unaffected.

**Trading Impact:** Significant for active traders in these securities. Tighter bands will:
- Limit intraday price movement
- Reduce speculation and volatility
- May decrease liquidity further
- Circuit breakers will trigger more frequently

**Investor Impact:** Provides greater price protection but may make entry/exit more difficult for position holders. Day traders will face restricted profit opportunities.
