**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine administrative circular with no impact on trading rules, market structure, or investor behavior. It provides necessary operational clarity for the upcoming month.

**Participant Impact:** All cash segment participants including trading members, clearing members, custodians, and depositories need to align their internal processes with this schedule to ensure timely settlement of trades and auction obligations.

**Time-Sensitive Actions:** Participants must update their internal calendars and settlement systems with these dates to avoid settlement failures or delayed fund/securities movements.
