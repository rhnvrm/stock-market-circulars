## Important Dates

- **November 10, 2025**: Record date for MFL-11.75%-26-6-26-PVT (ISIN: INE939X07135); effective date for reduced face value of Rs. 38,884 per debenture (Settlement: DR-752/2025-2026)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of these specific debenture series. The part redemption reduces outstanding principal, returning capital to investors while maintaining the instruments in circulation at lower face values.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new face values from the effective dates. Debenture holders on the record dates will receive part redemption proceeds plus accrued interest, improving liquidity for those investors.
