## Summary

BSE has updated the list of securities under the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective September 5, 2025. Eight securities have been newly shortlisted for LT-ASM, while two securities are moving out of the framework due to inclusion in the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework.

- Securities under LT-ASM subject to enhanced monitoring and trading restrictions
- Movement of securities between different surveillance frameworks based on risk assessment

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

**Newly Added Securities**: Arunjyoti Bio Ventures, Fruition Venture, Humming Bird Education, Prerna Infrabuild, Shish Industries, Starlineps Enterprises, Storage Technologies and Automation, and Vimta Labs will face enhanced surveillance measures including potential trading restrictions and additional margin requirements.
