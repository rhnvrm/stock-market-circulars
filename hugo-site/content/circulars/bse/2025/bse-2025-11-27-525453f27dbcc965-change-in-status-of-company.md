---

## Summary

BSE announced that Era Infra Engineering Ltd, which was delisted from the exchange on July 4, 2018, will have its status changed from 'Delisted' to 'Suspended' effective December 1, 2025. This change is due to a moratorium declared by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

## Key Points

- Era Infra Engineering Ltd (Scrip Code: 530323) was originally delisted on July 4, 2018 via notice no. 20180702-28
- Status will change from 'Delisted' to 'Suspended' effective December 1, 2025
- Change is due to moratorium order from NCLT
- Trading members requiring clarification can email bse.delistscn@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This is an administrative status change for one company based on legal proceedings.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members should note the status change for Era Infra Engineering Ltd (Scrip Code: 530323) in their systems. For clarifications, members should contact BSE at bse.delistscn@bseindia.com.

## Important Dates

- **Original Delisting Date**: July 4, 2018
- **Status Change Effective Date**: December 1, 2025
- **Notice Date**: November 27, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as the company has not been trading since its delisting in 2018. The status change from 'Delisted' to 'Suspended' is an administrative reclassification reflecting ongoing NCLT proceedings and moratorium. This affects record-keeping and classification but does not enable trading or have broader market implications.
