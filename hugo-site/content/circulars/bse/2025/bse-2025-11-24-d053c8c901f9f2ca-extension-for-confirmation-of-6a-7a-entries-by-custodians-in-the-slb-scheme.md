title: Extension for Confirmation of 6A-7A entries by Custodians in the SLB scheme
---

## Summary

BSE has extended the custodian confirmation window for 6A-7A entries in the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) scheme from 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM. This extension applies to trades executed from November 25, 2025 onwards and provides custodians an additional 30 minutes to complete their confirmation activities.

## Key Points

- Custodian confirmation window extended by 30 minutes
- New confirmation deadline is 6:30 PM (previously 6:00 PM)
- Applies to 6A-7A entries in the SLB scheme
- Effective for trades executed from November 25, 2025 onwards
- Issued by Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd (ICCL)
- Notice Number: 20251124-62
- Category: Settlement/RMS

## Regulatory Changes

The confirmation window for custodians to process 6A-7A entries in the Securities Lending and Borrowing Scheme has been extended from 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM. This modifies the operational timeline specified in the Master Circular for Transactions in Securities Lending and Borrowing Scheme (20250501-5) dated May 01, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Members and Custodians**: Must note the new extended confirmation window timing
- **Custodians**: Can now complete 6A-7A entry confirmations until 6:30 PM instead of 6:00 PM
- **Participants**: Should adjust their operational processes to accommodate the extended window

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 24, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 25, 2025 (for trades executed from this date onwards)
- **New Confirmation Deadline**: 6:30 PM (extended from 6:00 PM)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: This extension provides custodians with additional processing time, potentially reducing operational risks and improving efficiency in confirming SLB transactions. The 30-minute extension allows for better handling of end-of-day confirmation activities.

**Market Impact**: Minimal direct market impact. This is primarily an operational enhancement that benefits custodians and participants by providing more flexibility in the confirmation process. It may lead to fewer failed confirmations and smoother settlement operations in the SLB scheme.
