  by Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs) with Respect to T+0 Settlement Cycle
---

## Summary

SEBI has further extended the timeline for Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs) to implement necessary systems and processes for enabling seamless investor participation in the optional T+0 settlement cycle. The previous deadline of November 01, 2025 has been postponed indefinitely, with further guidance to be provided at a later date. This extension follows challenges highlighted by QSBs regarding timely system readiness.

## Key Points

- Timeline for QSBs to implement T+0 settlement systems extended beyond November 01, 2025
- New deadline to be communicated at a later date
- Extension applies to QSBs designated as such and meeting minimum active client parameters as of December 31, 2024
- This is the second extension after the initial May 01, 2025 deadline was moved to November 01, 2025
- All other provisions of SEBI Circular dated December 10, 2024 remain unchanged
- Decision based on challenges highlighted by QSBs in ensuring timely system readiness

## Regulatory Changes

**Original Framework (December 10, 2024):**
- SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-3/P/CIR/2024/172 enhanced scope of optional T+0 rolling settlement cycle in addition to existing T+1 settlement cycle in Equity Cash Markets
- QSBs meeting minimum active client parameters as of December 31, 2024 required to put in place necessary systems

**First Extension (April 29, 2025):**
- SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-3/P/CIR/2025/58 extended implementation deadline from May 01, 2025 to November 01, 2025

**Current Extension (October 30, 2025):**
- Timeline extended beyond November 01, 2025 with new date to be announced
- Extension based on feedback from QSBs, discussions with Stock Exchanges, Clearing Corporations, and Depositories

## Compliance Requirements

**For Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs):**
- Must eventually put in place necessary systems and processes for enabling seamless participation of investors in optional T+0 settlement cycle
- Applies to brokers designated as QSBs who met minimum active client parameters as of December 31, 2024
- Immediate pressure for November 01, 2025 readiness removed
- Must await further guidance on new implementation timeline

**For Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs):**
- Take necessary steps and put in place systems for implementation
- Make necessary amendments to relevant byelaws, rules, and regulations wherever required
- Bring provisions to notice of market participants including investors
- Disseminate circular on their website

## Important Dates

- **December 10, 2024**: Original SEBI circular issued enhancing scope of optional T+0 settlement
- **December 31, 2024**: Reference date for QSB designation and minimum active client parameters
- **May 01, 2025**: Original implementation deadline (later extended)
- **April 29, 2025**: First extension circular issued
- **November 01, 2025**: Previous extended deadline (now further extended)
- **October 30, 2025**: Current circular issued
- **To Be Announced**: New implementation deadline for QSB system readiness

## Impact Assessment

**Market Infrastructure Impact:**
- Delays rollout of optional T+0 settlement infrastructure for retail investors
- Provides additional time for QSBs to develop and test systems without rushed implementation
- Indicates significant technical and operational challenges in implementing T+0 settlement at broker level

**Broker Impact:**
- Relieves immediate implementation pressure on Qualified Stock Brokers
- Allows more time for system development, testing, and integration
- Reflects industry-wide concerns about readiness for T+0 settlement operations

**Investor Impact:**
- Delays availability of optional T+0 settlement for seamless participation
- Ensures more robust implementation when finally rolled out
- Maintains status quo of T+1 settlement cycle as primary mechanism

**Regulatory Impact:**
- Demonstrates regulatory flexibility in response to industry feedback
- Uncertainty around new timeline may affect planning for market participants
- Two extensions suggest more complex implementation challenges than initially anticipated
