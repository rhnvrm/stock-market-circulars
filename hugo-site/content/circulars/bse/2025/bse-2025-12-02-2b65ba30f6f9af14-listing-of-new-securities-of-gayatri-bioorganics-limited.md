These shares were issued at Rs. 11.76 per share to promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to an order from the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR). The shares are subject to lock-in periods extending until June 2026 and June 2027.

## Key Points

- Total new shares listed: 1,70,06,802 equity shares of Rs. 10/- face value each
- Issue price: Rs. 11.76 per share
- Allotment basis: Preferential allotment to promoters pursuant to BIFR order
- Date of allotment: October 13, 2016
- Trading commencement: December 3, 2025
- ISIN: INE052E01015
- Distinctive numbers: 61781341 to 78788142
- New shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following BIFR-mandated preferential allotment to promoters.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the new securities for trading purposes
- Lock-in restrictions must be observed as per the schedule provided
- The shares cannot be transferred or sold during the lock-in period

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: October 13, 2016
- **Trading Effective Date**: December 3, 2025 (Wednesday)
- **Lock-in Expiry (12,49,173 shares)**: June 30, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry (1,57,57,629 shares)**: June 30, 2027

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The listing increases the company's equity capital significantly. However, with lock-in periods extending until 2027, immediate market impact is limited as most shares (92.7%) remain locked until June 2027.

**Shareholding Impact**: The preferential allotment to promoters will likely increase promoter holding percentage, strengthening promoter control. The issuance was part of BIFR restructuring proceedings, suggesting the company underwent financial rehabilitation.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact on free float as all newly listed shares are subject to lock-in restrictions. Gradual increase in tradable shares expected post June 2026 and 2027.

**Investor Consideration**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution in equity and assess the impact on earnings per share and voting rights.
