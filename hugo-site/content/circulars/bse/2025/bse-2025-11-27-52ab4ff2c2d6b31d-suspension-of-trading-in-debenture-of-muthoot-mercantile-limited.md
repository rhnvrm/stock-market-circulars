**Market Impact**: Low to medium. The suspension affects only holders of these specific debenture series. The action is procedural and expected as part of the normal redemption process.

**Investor Impact**: Medium for affected debenture holders. Investors holding these securities will not be able to trade them from the suspension date and should expect redemption proceeds and final interest payment as per the terms of the debentures.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to block trading in these four ISINs from December 5, 2025. Clients holding these debentures should be informed about the upcoming redemption and trading suspension.
