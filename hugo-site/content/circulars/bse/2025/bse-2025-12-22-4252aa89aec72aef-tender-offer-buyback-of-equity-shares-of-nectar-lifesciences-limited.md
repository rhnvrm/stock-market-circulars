## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: December 24, 2025
- **Ex-Entitlement Date**: December 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The buyback offer may create buying interest in NECTAR LIFESCIENCES shares ahead of the record date. The ex-entitlement date being the same as the record date means shareholders need to hold positions by December 23, 2025 close to be eligible.

**Shareholder Impact**: Shareholders of NECTAR LIFESCIENCES holding shares as of the record date will have the opportunity to participate in the tender offer buyback, potentially providing an exit option at the buyback price.

**Trading Impact**: Expected increased trading activity and potential price volatility around the record date as investors position themselves for buyback participation eligibility.
