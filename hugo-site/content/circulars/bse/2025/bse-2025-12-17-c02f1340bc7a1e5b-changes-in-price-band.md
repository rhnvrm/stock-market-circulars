## Regulatory Changes

Price band restrictions have been modified for surveillance purposes. Price bands limit the maximum price movement allowed for a scrip in a single trading session, serving as a circuit breaker mechanism.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands for the listed scrips from December 18, 2025
- Members should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com for any clarifications
- All trading systems must be updated to reflect new price band percentages

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 17, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 18, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The revised price bands will affect trading volatility and daily price movement limits for the eight specified scrips. Tighter price bands (5%) impose stricter controls on price fluctuations, while 10% bands allow for greater price movement. These changes are surveillance measures to manage market volatility and protect investor interests in these specific securities.
