## Summary

BSE has announced revisions to price bands for 34 securities effective from November 13, 2025. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20%, representing enhanced surveillance measures for these stocks. Price bands control the maximum price movement allowed in a single trading session, serving as circuit filters to prevent excessive volatility.

## Key Points

- 15 stocks assigned 5% price band

- 1 stock (Supertech EV Ltd) assigned 10% price band

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** November 12, 2025
- **Effective Date:** November 13, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Moderate impact on 34 securities, predominantly small and micro-cap stocks. Tighter price bands (2-5%) will significantly restrict intraday volatility and may reduce speculative trading activity. Securities with 20% bands (GFL Ltd, Kalyani Investment Company Ltd, Nalwa Sons Investments Ltd, Pilani Investment and Industries Corporation Ltd, Titan Intech Ltd) retain higher trading flexibility.

**Liquidity Impact:** Stocks with tighter bands may experience reduced liquidity as price discovery becomes constrained. This could widen bid-ask spreads and increase trading costs.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders face limited exit options within single trading sessions for stocks with 2-5% bands. New investors may find entry opportunities restricted.

**Surveillance Context:** Price band tightening typically indicates heightened surveillance concerns related to unusual price movements, low liquidity, compliance issues, or elevated volatility. Investors should exercise caution with these securities.
