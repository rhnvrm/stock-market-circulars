title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Securities Moving into GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular identifying 10 securities that are being moved into various stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. The GSM is a surveillance mechanism to enhance market integrity and safeguard investor interest by imposing restrictions on securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or other risk parameters. The securities are being moved to Stages I through IV based on their risk profile.

## Key Points

- 3 securities moving to GSM Stage I: SC Agrotech Ltd, Panabyte Technologies Ltd, Decillion Finance Ltd
- 3 securities moving to GSM Stage II: Jainex Aamcol Ltd, Adhata Global Ltd, B.C. Power Controls Ltd
- 1 security moving to GSM Stage III: JPT Securities Ltd
- 3 securities moving to GSM Stage IV: Shree Manufacturing Company Ltd, ACE Edutrend Ltd, Rap Corp Ltd
- Securities may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure) or IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) frameworks
- Total of 10 securities affected by this surveillance action

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework applies progressive surveillance measures based on stage:
- **Stage I**: Entry level surveillance with price band restrictions
- **Stage II**: Increased restrictions on trading parameters
- **Stage III**: Further tightening of trading conditions
- **Stage IV**: Strictest surveillance level with maximum restrictions

Securities in higher GSM stages typically face:
- Reduced price bands
- Trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday trading)
- 100% upfront margin requirements
- Additional disclosure requirements

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors trading in these securities must provide 100% upfront margins
- All trades will be settled on a trade-for-trade basis in applicable stages
- Market participants must be aware of the applicable price bands and trading restrictions
- Brokers should inform clients about the GSM status of these securities before accepting orders

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: November 18, 2025
- Effective Date: As per BSE implementation schedule (typically next trading day)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The movement of securities into GSM stages will result in reduced liquidity and trading volumes for the affected stocks. Intraday traders and speculators will exit these securities due to trade-for-trade settlement requirements.

**Investor Impact**: Retail investors holding these securities may face difficulty in exiting positions due to reduced liquidity. The 100% margin requirement will limit leveraged trading.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members must update their systems to enforce GSM-specific trading restrictions and margin requirements. Increased monitoring and client communication will be necessary.
