## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects 103 securities with varying liquidity profiles. High-volume auctions in liquid stocks like ASHOK LEYLAND (9,000 shares), SPICEJET (25,000 shares), and Franklin Industries (82,943 shares) may experience temporary price pressure.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - brokers with short positions must arrange securities through auction, potentially at premium prices. Large quantity auctions like Franklin Industries and SPICEJET require significant capital commitment.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - existing shareholders generally unaffected unless they choose to participate in auction selling. Price discovery through auction may differ from regular market prices.
