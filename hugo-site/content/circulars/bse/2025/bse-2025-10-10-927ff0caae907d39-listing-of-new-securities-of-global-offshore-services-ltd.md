## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the listing of new securities effective October 13, 2025
- All 35,000 shares are subject to lock-in restrictions and cannot be transferred until April 30, 2026
- Shares must be treated as locked-in securities in trading systems during the lock-in period

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: July 8, 2025

- **Lock-in Expiry**: April 30, 2026
- **Notice Date**: October 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The issuance of 35,000 shares represents a small volume addition to the existing equity base of Global Offshore Services Ltd. The preferential allotment to non-promoters at Rs. 92/- per share is a standard corporate action.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible immediate impact on trading liquidity as all shares are locked-in until April 30, 2026. Post lock-in expiry, the additional float may marginally improve liquidity.

**Investor Impact**: Non-promoter investors who converted warrants will have their shares listed but cannot trade until lock-in expires. Existing shareholders experience minimal dilution given the small number of shares issued.
