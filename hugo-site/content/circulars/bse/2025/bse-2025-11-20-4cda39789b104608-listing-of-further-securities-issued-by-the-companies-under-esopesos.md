## Summary

BSE has announced the listing and admission for trading of further securities issued under Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS) by 13 companies. These securities will be available for trading on the Exchange effective Friday, November 21, 2025. The total number of new shares being listed is 2,550,365 across various face values, with no lock-in restrictions applicable to any of the listed securities.

## Key Points

- 13 companies issuing further securities under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Total shares being listed: 2,550,365
- Effective trading date: November 21, 2025
- No lock-in period applicable to any of the listed securities
- Largest issuances: Aditya Birla Capital (738,680 shares), ICICI Bank (572,490 shares), Syrma SGS Technology (366,322 shares)
- Face values range from Re. 1 to Rs. 10 depending on the company
- All securities have been allotted specific distinctive number ranges

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced in this circular. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks as per SEBI regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the listing of these new securities in their systems
- Companies must ensure proper updating of shareholding patterns to reflect the new issuances
- Unique identification through ISIN and scrip codes must be maintained for trading purposes
- Distinctive number ranges assigned to each issuance must be recorded accurately

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 20, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date**: November 21, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not Applicable (NA) for all securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The securities being listed represent routine ESOP/ESOS conversions and constitute a small percentage of the total outstanding equity for each company. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares are immediately tradeable, but given the relatively small quantities, significant price movements are unlikely.

**Operational Impact**: Standard operational update for trading members to incorporate new securities into their trading systems. No special trading arrangements or restrictions required.

**Shareholding Impact**: Marginal dilution for existing shareholders across the 13 companies. For example, ICICI Bank's 572,490 shares and Aditya Birla Capital's 738,680 shares represent minimal dilution given their large equity bases.
