## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine administrative notification for listing of securities already issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to update their systems for the new securities
- No specific compliance actions required from market participants
- Companies have completed their listing formalities with BSE

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 31, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: November 3, 2025 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Period**: None (NA for all securities)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The quantities being listed represent small percentages of the outstanding shares for these companies. The largest issuance is 188,287 shares by Axis Bank, which is negligible compared to its total issued capital.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in floating stock for the affected companies. With no lock-in restrictions, these shares are immediately available for trading, but the small volumes are unlikely to affect market dynamics.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for ESOP/ESOS beneficiaries who can now trade their allotted shares immediately. No direct impact on existing shareholders as these dilutions are typically already accounted for in fully diluted share capital calculations.
