**Market Impact**: Limited to existing shareholders of PULSAR INTERNATIONAL LIMITED who can trade their rights entitlements during the 14-day renunciation window. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade mechanism ensures controlled trading environment.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members handling PULSAR INTERNATIONAL shares must update systems for REs trading under scrip code 751071 (ISIN: INE183U20014) and ensure proper client communication with mandatory disclaimers in contract notes. The relatively short trading window (December 31, 2025 to January 13, 2026) requires prompt client notification and processing.
