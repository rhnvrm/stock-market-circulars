## Regulatory Changes

The Exchange has modified the applicable price band limits for the listed securities. Price bands restrict the maximum percentage movement (upward or downward) allowed in a security's price during a trading session, serving as a circuit breaker mechanism.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure their trading systems are updated to reflect the revised price bands
- Members must adhere to the new price band limits from December 23, 2025
- For clarifications, members should contact BSE at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 22, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 23, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The revised price bands will limit intraday price movements for these securities. Securities with 2% bands (Gujarat Investa, Hemo Organic, Shree Krishna Paper Mills, Unipro Technologies) will have tighter price movement restrictions, potentially reducing volatility but also limiting liquidity. Helloji Holidays with a 20% band will have the most trading flexibility among the affected securities.

**Market Participants**: Traders and investors in these securities should be aware of the reduced price movement limits, which may affect their trading strategies and ability to enter or exit positions at desired prices.

**Surveillance Context**: This action is part of BSE's surveillance mechanism to maintain market integrity and prevent excessive speculation in these securities.
