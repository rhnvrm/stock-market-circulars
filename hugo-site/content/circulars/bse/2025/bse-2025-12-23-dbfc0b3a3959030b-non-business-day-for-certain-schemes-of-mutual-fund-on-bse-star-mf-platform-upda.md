## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is a routine operational update. Investors in the listed schemes will not be able to place subscription or redemption orders on the specified non-business days through the BSE StAR MF Platform. The closures align with international market holidays (Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve) in the underlying markets where these funds invest (Japan, US, and global markets). Investors should plan their transactions accordingly to avoid the non-business days.
