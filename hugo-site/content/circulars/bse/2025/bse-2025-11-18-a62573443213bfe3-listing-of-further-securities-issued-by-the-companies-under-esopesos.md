- Trading members must note the listing of these securities for trading from November 19, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The listing has minimal market impact as ESOP/ESOS issuances are typically small relative to total outstanding shares and are already factored into companies' diluted share capital calculations. The shares represent employee compensation and their listing is a routine corporate action. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share count for each company. The absence of lock-in periods means these shares are immediately available for trading, though actual trading activity will depend on employee decisions to hold or sell.
