## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** HIGH - This is a significant disinvestment involving a public sector bank with up to 46.14 crore shares potentially entering the market. At the floor price of Rs. 54, the base offer represents approximately Rs. 2,077 crore, with total potential value of Rs. 2,492 crore including oversubscription.

**Liquidity Impact:** The OFS will significantly increase trading volumes in MAHABANK stock. The price priority allocation method may lead to price discovery above the floor price based on demand.

**Investor Participation:** The structured approach with separate days for institutional and retail investors ensures orderly participation. The 10% retail reservation provides retail investors dedicated allocation opportunity.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure system readiness for handling large bid volumes across multiple investor categories with different margin requirements and settlement cycles. The carry-forward mechanism for unallocated bids from T to T+1 day requires careful tracking and processing.
