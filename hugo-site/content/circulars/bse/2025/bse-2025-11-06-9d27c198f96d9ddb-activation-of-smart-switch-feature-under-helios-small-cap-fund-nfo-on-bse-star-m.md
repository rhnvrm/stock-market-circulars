## Key Points

- SMART Switch feature enabled for HELIOS SMALL CAP FUND New Fund Offer (NFO)
- Two switching routes available: from HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND Direct Plan Growth and Regular Plan Growth
- Subscriptions received through NFO SMART Switch will be reported to AMC/RTA as transactions from the respective HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND schemes
- Feature operational on BSE StAR MF platform

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an operational activation of an existing platform feature.

## Compliance Requirements

- AMC/RTA to accept transaction reports for switches from HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND schemes as per the mapping provided
- Trading members and investors to use correct scheme codes when executing SMART Switch transactions

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: November 6, 2025
- NFO period dates not specified in this circular

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal - affects only investors in HELIOS Mutual Fund schemes
