---

## Summary

## Key Points

- Entities listed on multiple exchanges must submit disclosures simultaneously to all exchanges
- BSE has observed time lags in certain disclosures, particularly financial results and price sensitive information
- Time lag in disclosures leads to information asymmetry in the market
- This is a governance measure in the larger interest of investors

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory requirements introduced. This is an advisory reinforcing existing obligations for simultaneous disclosure submission across multiple exchanges.

## Compliance Requirements

- All multi-exchange listed entities must ensure simultaneous submission of disclosures to all exchanges where they are listed
- Particular attention required for financial results and price sensitive information disclosures
- Entities must avoid any time lag between submissions to different exchanges

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: August 7, 2025
