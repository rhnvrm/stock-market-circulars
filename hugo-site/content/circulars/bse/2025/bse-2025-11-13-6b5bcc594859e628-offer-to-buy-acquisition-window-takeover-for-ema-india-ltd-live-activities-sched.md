**Operational Impact**: Medium for participating members. Trading members and custodians handling EMA INDIA LTD clients need to:
- Ensure proper UCC registration and updates
- Access and operate the iBBS/RTRMS platforms during the offer period
- Process bids only for clients with demat holdings
- Monitor give-up/take-up activities throughout the 14-day offer period

**Investor Impact**: High for EMA INDIA LTD shareholders. Existing shareholders have an opportunity to tender their shares at Rs. 124 per share during the acquisition window. The offer price represents a specific valuation that shareholders can evaluate against their cost basis and market expectations.

**Contact Support**: Multiple contact points provided for technical assistance with iBBS, RTRMS, and Extranet systems, including Trading Operations (022-22728005) and specific personnel for OTB module queries.
