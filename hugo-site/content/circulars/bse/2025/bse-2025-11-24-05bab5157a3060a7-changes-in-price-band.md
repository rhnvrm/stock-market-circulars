## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements price band revisions as part of BSE's surveillance measures. Price bands limit the maximum price movement allowed in a single trading session, serving as a circuit breaker mechanism to control excessive volatility and protect investors.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure orders comply with revised price bands from November 25, 2025
- All trading systems must be updated to reflect new price band parameters
- Risk management systems should be adjusted for the affected scrips
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 24, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 25, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements for the affected scrips. Stocks with 2% bands will have significantly limited volatility, which may impact liquidity and day-trading strategies.

**Market Participants**: Traders and investors in these scrips need to adjust their strategies, particularly for the three stocks with 2% bands (Gautam Exim, MSR India, Yuranus Infrastructure) which face the most restrictive trading environment.

**Surveillance Implications**: The tightening of price bands suggests these securities may be under enhanced surveillance due to concerns about unusual price movements, volatility, or other market integrity issues. The 2% band is among the most restrictive measures BSE applies.

**Liquidity Considerations**: Stricter price bands may reduce trading volumes and liquidity in affected scrips as the limited price movement reduces opportunities for short-term traders.
