## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective November 14, 2025. Three securities have been newly shortlisted for ST-ASM Stage I, one security continues in the framework but moves to a lower stage, and nine securities are being removed from the ST-ASM framework. The consolidated list shows 14 securities currently under ST-ASM Stage I monitoring.

## Key Points

- 3 new securities added to ST-ASM Stage I: Anjani Foods Ltd, Pearl Global Industries Ltd, and Yatra Online Ltd
- Om Metallogic Ltd (SME scrip) moves to lower stage within ST-ASM framework
- 9 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework
- Some securities moving out are being placed in other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, GSM, ESM, Trade for Trade, or Pledge Framework)
- Changes become effective from November 14, 2025
- Framework includes both main board and SME scrips
- Pearl Global Industries Ltd and Yatra Online Ltd marked as per NSE coordination

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This circular represents routine updates to the existing Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework, which uses 5/15/30 days monitoring stages to track securities showing abnormal price movements or trading patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of securities under ST-ASM framework
- Enhanced surveillance and monitoring applies to listed securities
- Securities in ST-ASM may have additional margin requirements or trading restrictions
- Market participants should review their positions in affected securities
- Brokers must ensure appropriate risk management for securities under surveillance

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 14, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Securities newly added to ST-ASM framework may experience reduced liquidity and increased volatility as additional surveillance measures take effect. The framework is designed to protect investors from excessive speculation.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ST-ASM typically face stricter margin requirements and may be subject to additional reporting obligations. Traders holding positions in these securities should prepare for potential liquidity constraints.

**Investor Impact**: The movement of 9 securities out of ST-ASM framework (some into other surveillance measures like LT-ASM) indicates ongoing regulatory monitoring. Investors should exercise caution with all listed securities and understand the specific surveillance framework applicable to their holdings.
