## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This circular follows existing framework for Rights Entitlements trading as established in previous notices (20200305-21 dated March 05, 2020 and 20200518-34 dated May 18, 2020).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform all clients about commencement of trading in REs with correct ISIN

- Contract notes/bills containing REs purchases must prominently include disclaimer explaining:
  - Purchase of REs only grants right to participate in ongoing Rights Issue with requisite application money
  - REs can be renounced before issue closes
  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced will lapse and be extinguished after issue closing date

## Important Dates

- **Rights Entitlements Trading Period**: October 23, 2025 to November 10, 2025
- **Rights Issue Open Period**: October 23, 2025 to November 14, 2025
- **Issue Closing Date**: November 14, 2025 (after which unsubscribed/unrenounced REs will lapse)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to shareholders and potential investors of MAGNUS STEELAND INFRA LIMITED. The six-day window between REs trading closure (November 10) and issue closure (November 14) allows final subscription decisions.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure proper client communication, correct ISIN usage (INE898E20011), and appropriate disclaimers in contract notes. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis requires adequate operational preparedness.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders can trade their rights entitlements or subscribe to the rights issue. Investors purchasing REs must understand they acquire participation rights, not equity shares, and must act before November 14, 2025 to avoid lapsing.
