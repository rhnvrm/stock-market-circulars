## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing announcement with minimal market impact. The listing of commercial papers on the debt segment primarily affects institutional investors and debt market participants. The securities are short-term instruments (3-11 months tenure) issued by established companies with strong credit ratings (A1+). This provides additional investment options for institutional investors in the debt market but has no direct impact on equity markets or retail investors.
