## Summary

BSE has announced the listing of further securities issued by 12 companies under their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). These shares will be listed and admitted for trading on the Exchange effective December 2, 2025. The companies include major financial institutions like HDFC Bank (2,732,374 shares) and Axis Bank (161,807 shares), along with other listed entities. None of the shares are subject to lock-in periods.

## Key Points

- 12 companies issuing further securities under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Total of 6,581,273 shares across all companies
- Largest issuance: HDFC Bank Ltd. with 2,732,374 shares (face value ₹1)
- Second largest: Aditya Birla Capital Ltd. with 1,271,473 shares (face value ₹10)

- Trading effective date: December 2, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities available for trading
- Companies must ensure accurate distinctive number ranges are maintained
- Standard trading rules and regulations apply to these newly listed shares
- No special compliance requirements due to absence of lock-in periods

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 1, 2025
- **Listing and Trading Effective Date**: December 2, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (no lock-in period for any shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. ESOP share listings are routine corporate actions with limited impact on stock prices or market liquidity. The quantities involved represent small percentages of total outstanding shares for most companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in floating stock for the 12 companies. HDFC Bank's 2.7 million shares and Axis Bank's 161,807 shares are negligible relative to their large market capitalizations.

**Shareholder Impact**: Dilution is minimal and already anticipated through disclosed ESOP schemes. Existing shareholders are unlikely to experience material impact.

**Trading Impact**: Shares are immediately available for trading without restrictions, allowing employees to sell vested options. This may result in minor selling pressure but is typically absorbed by normal market activity.
