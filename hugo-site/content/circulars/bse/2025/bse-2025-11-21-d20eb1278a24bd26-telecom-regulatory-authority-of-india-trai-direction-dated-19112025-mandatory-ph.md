  Entities'
---

## Summary

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a Direction dated November 19, 2025, under section 13 read with section 11 of the TRAI Act, 1997, mandating phase-wise implementation of 1600-series numbers by entities regulated by RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA. This directive requires all Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector entities to exclusively use 1600-series numbers for service and transactional voice calls, replacing the current practice of using ten-digit mobile numbers.

## Key Points

- TRAI has allocated a separate numbering series "1600" exclusively for Government entities and BFSI sector entities for service and transactional voice calls
- Department of Telecommunications (DoT) conveyed allocation decision on December 23, 2024
- TRAI directed Access Providers to initiate allocation on December 31, 2024
- Despite consumer awareness campaigns, adoption by BFSI entities has remained low
- Most entities continue using ten-digit mobile numbers for service and transactional calls
- Mandate applies to entities regulated by RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA
- Implementation will be phased

## Regulatory Changes

**Legal Framework:**
- Direction issued under section 13, read with sub-clauses (i) and (v) of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 11 of the TRAI Act, 1997
- Based on Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018 (6 of 2018)
- Regulation 3 requires commercial communications to use registered headers or number resources from special series

**New Requirement:**

- Replaces current practice of using standard ten-digit mobile numbers
- Allocation coordinated through Access Providers (telecom service providers)

## Compliance Requirements

- All entities regulated by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)

**Required Actions:**
- Register with Access Providers for 1600-series number allocation
- Migrate all service and transactional voice calls to 1600-series numbers
- Discontinue use of ten-digit mobile numbers for service and transactional communications
- Update customer communication systems and infrastructure

- Major tool to curb promotional calls disguised as service and transactional calls
