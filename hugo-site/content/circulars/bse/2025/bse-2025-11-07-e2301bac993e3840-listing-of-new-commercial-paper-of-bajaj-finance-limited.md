## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt listing with minimal market impact. The commercial paper issuance is part of Bajaj Finance's regular short-term funding activities. The high credit ratings (CRISIL A1+ and ICRA A1+) indicate strong creditworthiness. The securities are privately placed and will trade only in the debt segment with institutional participation, limiting retail investor exposure. The discount pricing (issue price of Rs. 4,68,384 against face value of Rs. 5,00,000) implies an effective yield for investors over the one-year tenure.
