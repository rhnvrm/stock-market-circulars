## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: All existing shareholders as of the record date will receive three additional shares for every share held, significantly increasing their shareholding quantity while the overall ownership percentage remains unchanged. This will increase liquidity and make shares more affordable.

**Market Impact**: The bonus issue will increase the total equity shares from 1,15,00,000 to 4,60,00,000 shares (assuming current paid-up capital). The share price will adjust proportionately on the ex-bonus date to reflect the increased share capital.

**Trading Impact**: Enhanced liquidity expected post-listing of bonus shares on January 2, 2026, with potential for increased trading volumes due to larger float and lower price per share.
