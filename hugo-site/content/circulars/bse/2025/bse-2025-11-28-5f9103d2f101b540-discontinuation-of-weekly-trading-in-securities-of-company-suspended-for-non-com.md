title: Discontinuation of Weekly Trading for Seven Hill Industries Ltd
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the discontinuation of weekly trading facility for Seven Hill Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 511760) effective December 16, 2025. The company was previously allowed to trade on a Trade for Trade basis in Z group only on the first trading day of every week following its suspension for non-compliance with SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 2018. After completion of the mandated six-month period, this limited trading facility will be withdrawn.

## Key Points

- Seven Hill Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 511760) will have weekly trading discontinued from December 16, 2025
- Company was previously suspended for non-compliance with SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 2018
- Limited trading on Trade for Trade basis in Z group was allowed only on first trading day of each week
- Six-month mandated period has been completed
- Original suspension notice was issued on April 24, 2025 (Notice No. 20250424-24)

## Regulatory Changes

This action is taken pursuant to SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024, specifically Chapter-VII(A) dealing with Penal Actions for Non-Compliance. The circular outlines the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for suspension and revocation of equity shares of listed entities for non-compliance with SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the discontinuation of trading facility for Seven Hill Industries Ltd
- No trading will be permitted in the scrip from December 16, 2025 onwards
- For clarifications, market participants should contact BSE at bse.soplodr@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **April 24, 2025**: Initial suspension notice issued (Notice No. 20250424-24)
- **November 28, 2025**: Circular announcing discontinuation of weekly trading
- **December 16, 2025**: Effective date for discontinuation of weekly trading facility

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to Seven Hill Industries Ltd and its shareholders. The company was already under severe trading restrictions (Trade for Trade basis in Z group, only weekly trading). Complete discontinuation of trading further restricts liquidity for existing shareholders but has minimal impact on broader market operations. This is a company-specific penal measure with no systemic market implications.
