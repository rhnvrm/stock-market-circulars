## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective November 03, 2025. The circular identifies 8 securities being newly shortlisted under the ST-ASM framework, 14 securities moving out of the framework, and provides a consolidated list of all securities currently under surveillance. Securities are monitored under 5/15/30 days stages based on price volatility and trading patterns.

Securities under this framework are subject to additional margin requirements and trading restrictions based on their stage classification. The framework operates on 5/15/30 day monitoring periods to identify and control excessive speculation.

## Compliance Requirements
