## Impact Assessment

This represents a significant new listing event for Pine Labs Limited on BSE. The unusual shareholding structure with zero promoter holding and 100% public shareholding suggests this may be following a complete divestment by promoters or a specific corporate structure. The presence of outstanding convertible securities (approximately 5.1% dilution potential) indicates employee stock options or similar instruments are in place. The high dematerialization rate of 91.47% is positive for trading liquidity. With over 216,000 public shareholders, the stock is likely to have broad-based ownership and reasonable trading volumes.
