title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework Updates - November 28, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework effective November 28, 2025. Two new securities have been added to the ESM framework: Capital Trade Links Ltd (Scrip Code: 538476) and SVP Global Textiles Ltd (Scrip Code: 505590). One security, Omnitex Industries India Ltd (Scrip Code: 514324), will be moved to a higher ESM stage. No securities are being moved to lower ESM stages or exiting the framework. The circular includes a comprehensive consolidated list of 29+ securities currently under various ESM stages.

## Key Points

- 2 securities newly shortlisted for ESM Framework: Capital Trade Links Ltd and SVP Global Textiles Ltd
- 1 security (Omnitex Industries India Ltd) moving to higher ESM stage
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages
- No securities moving out of ESM Framework
- Consolidated list includes securities across ESM Stage I and Stage II
- SVP Global Textiles Ltd marked with asterisk indicating alignment with NSE
- Multiple SME scrips included in the consolidated ESM list (marked with #)

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM Framework is a surveillance mechanism designed to alert investors about securities exhibiting unusual price movements or other risk parameters. Securities placed under ESM are subject to:

- Enhanced disclosure requirements
- Periodic surveillance reviews
- Potential trading restrictions based on ESM stage
- Progression through multiple stages (Stage I, II, etc.) based on continued risk factors

Movement to higher ESM stages typically indicates continued concerns regarding the security's trading pattern or compliance issues.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure awareness of securities under ESM Framework
- Investors should exercise additional caution when trading ESM securities
- Listed companies under ESM may face additional disclosure and compliance obligations
- Market participants must adhere to any specific trading conditions applicable to ESM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 28, 2025 - All ESM changes take effect from market opening

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of new securities and stage progression affects investor sentiment and trading activity in specific scrips. ESM placement typically results in reduced liquidity and increased volatility awareness.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or considering positions in the affected securities should exercise enhanced due diligence. Higher ESM stages may indicate increased regulatory scrutiny and potential future restrictions.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and brokers must update their systems and risk management frameworks to reflect the new ESM classifications and ensure proper client communication regarding these securities.
