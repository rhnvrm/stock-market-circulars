## Summary

BSE has announced the listing and admission for trading of further securities issued by 15 companies under their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). These shares will be available for trading from December 24, 2025. The circular covers major companies including ICICI Bank, Cipla, Coforge, and Aditya Birla Group entities. None of the listed shares are subject to lock-in restrictions.

## Key Points

- 15 companies issuing additional shares through ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Total shares being listed: 2,491,843 shares across all companies
- Effective trading date: December 24, 2025 (Wednesday)
- No lock-in period applicable for any of the securities
- Largest issuance: Aditya Birla Capital Limited with 1,375,753 shares
- Major companies include ICICI Bank (19,752 shares), Cipla (585 shares), and Coforge (145,189 shares)
- Face values range from Rs. 2 to Rs. 10 per share depending on the company

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational circular for listing additional securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital for the listed companies
- Trading members to note the new distinctive numbers ranges for each company's shares
- Companies have completed necessary listing formalities as per BSE requirements

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 23, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date:** December 24, 2025 (Wednesday)
- **Lock-in Expiry:** Not applicable (NA for all companies)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal to negligible. The number of shares being listed represents a small fraction of the total outstanding shares for most companies. For example, ICICI Bank is listing only 19,752 shares against its massive equity base.

**Liquidity Impact:** Marginal increase in floating stock for the listed companies. The additional shares will provide slightly more liquidity but are unlikely to materially affect trading volumes.

**Investor Impact:** Neutral. Routine ESOP issuances are expected corporate actions and are typically already factored into valuations. The absence of lock-in restrictions means shares can be traded immediately.

**Company-Specific Notable Issuances:**
- Vascon Engineers Limited has the highest absolute number at 2,380,000 shares
- Aditya Birla Capital Limited issuing 1,375,753 shares
- Birlasoft Limited adding 147,241 shares
- Coforge Limited listing 145,189 shares
