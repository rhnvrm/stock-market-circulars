## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High impact corporate action that will reduce the number of outstanding shares by up to 1.31%, potentially increasing earnings per share and providing exit opportunity to shareholders at a premium price of ₹4,800 per share. The substantial buyback size of ₹3,000 million demonstrates strong cash position and management confidence in the company's fundamentals.

**Shareholder Impact:** Shareholders as on record date (December 17, 2025) will have the opportunity to tender their shares on a proportionate basis. The buyback price represents a significant premium and provides liquidity option. Non-participating shareholders may benefit from increased proportionate ownership and potential EPS accretion.

**Operational Impact:** The company's cash reserves will be reduced by up to ₹3,000 million plus expenses. However, the buyback is within regulatory limits (well below 25% threshold) indicating prudent capital allocation while maintaining adequate reserves for operations.
