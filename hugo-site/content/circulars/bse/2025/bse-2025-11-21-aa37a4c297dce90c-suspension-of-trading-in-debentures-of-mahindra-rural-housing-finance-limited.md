The suspension is due to the company fixing the record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in the affected debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Debenture series: MRHFL-8.315%-12-12-25-PVT
- No dealings allowed from November 27, 2025

- Circular reference: DR-765/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational notice for corporate action processing.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from November 27, 2025
- Members should note the suspension and inform their clients holding or intending to trade these securities
- Existing positions must be managed with awareness of the suspension period

## Important Dates

- **November 21, 2025**: Notice date and circular issuance
- **November 27, 2025**: Record date for interest payment and redemption
- **November 27, 2025**: No dealings from this date (trading suspension effective)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. The suspension affects only a specific series of debentures from a single issuer in the debt market segment. Investors holding these debentures should be aware they cannot exit their positions through secondary market trading during the suspension period.

**Operational Impact**: Routine corporate action. Debenture holders will receive their scheduled interest payment and principal redemption as per the terms. The suspension is temporary and standard practice to freeze ownership for entitlement purposes.

**Investor Impact**: Holders of these specific debentures are affected by the trading suspension but will receive their entitled payments based on the record date. New investors cannot enter positions in these securities during the suspension period.
