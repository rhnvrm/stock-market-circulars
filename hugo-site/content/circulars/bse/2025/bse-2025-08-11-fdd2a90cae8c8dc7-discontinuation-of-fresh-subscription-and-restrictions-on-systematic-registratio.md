## Summary

ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund has announced the discontinuation of fresh subscriptions through lump sum, SIP, and STP modes for three schemes effective August 13, 2025. The affected schemes are US Bluechip Equity Fund, Nasdaq 100 Index Fund, and Strategic Metal and Energy Equity Fund of Funds. Existing systematic transactions will continue to be processed.

- Three specific schemes affected: US Bluechip Equity Fund, Nasdaq 100 Index Fund, Strategic Metal and Energy Equity Fund of Funds
- Existing SIP/STP installments will continue to be processed
- AMC may resume subscriptions if limits become available or SEBI/AMFI provides clarification

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes - this is an operational decision by the AMC likely due to investment limits or regulatory restrictions on overseas investments.

## Compliance Requirements

- Existing systematic plans will continue as per scheme documents
- All other provisions of scheme information documents remain unchanged

## Important Dates

The restriction may be temporary pending regulatory clarity or investment limit availability.
