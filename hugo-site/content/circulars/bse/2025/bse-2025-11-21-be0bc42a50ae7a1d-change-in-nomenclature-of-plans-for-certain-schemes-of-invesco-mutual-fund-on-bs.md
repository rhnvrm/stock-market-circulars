No regulatory changes are involved. This is a nomenclature standardization exercise to clearly identify schemes as 'Regular Plan' variants, likely to distinguish them from Direct Plan options as per SEBI mutual fund regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Invesco Mutual Fund to update all marketing materials, factsheets, and documentation with new scheme names
- BSE StAR MF Platform to reflect updated nomenclature in its systems
- No action required from investors as ISIN codes remain unchanged
- Fund houses and distributors should use updated scheme names in all future communications

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: November 21, 2025
- Effective Date: Immediate (as per BSE notification)

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact:** None. Existing investments, NAVs, and portfolio allocations remain completely unchanged. Only the display name of the schemes is modified.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal. System updates required at BSE StAR MF Platform and by distributors/platforms to reflect new nomenclature.

**Market Impact:** No market impact. This is purely an administrative naming convention update to improve clarity and transparency in scheme identification.

**Compliance Impact:** Enhances clarity in distinguishing Regular Plans from other plan types, supporting better investor understanding and regulatory compliance with SEBI guidelines on plan disclosure.
