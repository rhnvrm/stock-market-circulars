## Impact Assessment

This is a substantial rights issue representing a significant increase in the company's equity capital. The 46.35 crore shares issued will result in dilution for existing shareholders who did not participate in the rights issue. The shares being issued at par (Re. 1/-) indicates a deeply discounted offer. Trading members should be prepared for increased trading activity and ensure systems can handle the expanded share base. The pari-passu ranking ensures equal rights for all shareholders.
