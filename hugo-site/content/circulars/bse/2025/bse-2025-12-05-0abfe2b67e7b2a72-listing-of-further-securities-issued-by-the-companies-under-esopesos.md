## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for securities already issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the listing of these securities
- Securities will be available for trading from December 8, 2025
- Standard trading and settlement procedures will apply

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 5, 2025
- **Listing and Trading Commencement Date**: December 8, 2025 (Monday)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The quantities being listed are relatively small compared to the existing float of these companies. The largest listing is 475,000 shares of Aditya Vision Limited, which is unlikely to significantly impact market dynamics.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in tradable shares for the listed companies. The absence of lock-in periods means these shares are immediately available for trading.

**Corporate Action**: Routine administrative listing following ESOP/ESOS exercises by employees. This is a standard corporate action reflecting employee stock option conversions.

**Investor Consideration**: No immediate action required by investors. The dilution effect is negligible given the small number of shares relative to existing equity base of these companies.
