## Impact Assessment

The impact of this listing is expected to be minimal on the overall market. The addition of these shares represents a small percentage increase in the outstanding equity of the respective companies. SUZLON ENERGY has the largest absolute number of shares being listed (1.248 million), but this is relatively small compared to its total outstanding shares of over 14 billion. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares can be traded immediately, but given the moderate quantities involved, significant price volatility is not anticipated. This is a routine corporate action related to employee compensation schemes.
