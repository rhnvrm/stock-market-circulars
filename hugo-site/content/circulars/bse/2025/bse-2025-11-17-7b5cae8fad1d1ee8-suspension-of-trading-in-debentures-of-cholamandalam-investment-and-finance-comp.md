  COMPANY LTD
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in two series of Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) issued by CHOLAMANDALAM INVESTMENT AND FINANCE COMPANY LTD effective November 21, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing the record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these specific debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Two NCD series affected: CIFCL-8.40%-7-12-25-NCD (ISIN: INE121A07RJ8, Code: 939014) and CIFCL-ZC-7-1-2-25-NCD (ISIN: INE121A07RL4, Code: 939016)
- Record date set for November 21, 2025 for both series
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Trading suspension begins November 21, 2025
- Notice reference: DR-761/2025-2026
- Notice issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action notification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the specified debentures from November 21, 2025 onwards
- Trading members are required to take note of the suspension and comply immediately
- No transactions should be executed in ISIN INE121A07RJ8 (Code: 939014) and ISIN INE121A07RL4 (Code: 939016) from the specified date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** November 17, 2025
- **Record Date:** November 21, 2025
- **No Dealings From:** November 21, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and potential traders of these two specific NCD series of Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company Ltd. The suspension is a standard procedure for debenture redemption and interest payment processes. Investors holding these debentures as of the record date will receive their redemption proceeds and final interest payment. The market impact is minimal as this affects only two debt instruments and is a routine corporate action. Trading members need to ensure their systems are updated to prevent inadvertent trading in these suspended securities.
