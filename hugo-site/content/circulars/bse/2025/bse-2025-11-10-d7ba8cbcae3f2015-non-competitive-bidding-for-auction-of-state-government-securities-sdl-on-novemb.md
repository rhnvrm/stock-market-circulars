## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational circular for debt market participants. The impact is limited to institutional investors and trading members participating in government securities auctions. It provides an opportunity to invest in state development loans from 10 Indian states with varying tenures (2028-2056). The non-competitive bidding facility allows retail and smaller investors to participate in SDL auctions without competing on price with institutional bidders. No impact on equity markets or general retail investors.
