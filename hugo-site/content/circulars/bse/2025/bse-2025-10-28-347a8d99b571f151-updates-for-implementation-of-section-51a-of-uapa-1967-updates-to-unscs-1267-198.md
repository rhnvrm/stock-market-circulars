## Regulatory Changes

This circular updates market participants on changes to the UN Security Council's ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions List pursuant to Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The sanctions list is maintained under Security Council resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011), 2253 (2015), 2368 (2017), and 2734 (2024). The amendment involves modifications to biographical information for one listed individual.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with Section 51A of UAPA, 1967 regarding implementation of UN sanctions
- Entities should update their sanctions screening databases with the amended entry
- Assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo provisions must be enforced for listed individuals
- Regular monitoring of the UN Security Council Consolidated List is required
- KYC and AML procedures should incorporate updated sanctions list information

## Important Dates

- **21 October 2025**: Amendment to sanctions list entry enacted
- **28 October 2025**: BSE circular issued

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal direct impact on trading operations or listed securities. This is an administrative compliance update.

**Operational Impact**: Financial institutions and intermediaries need to update their sanctions screening systems to reflect the amended entry. However, since the individual was reportedly killed in 2012, practical operational impact is negligible.

**Compliance Impact**: Market participants must maintain awareness of UN sanctions lists as part of their ongoing AML/CFT compliance obligations under Indian law, particularly Section 51A of UAPA, 1967.
