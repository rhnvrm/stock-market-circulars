- Trading members are explicitly instructed not to deal in these securities
- Notice issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance and Operations

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease dealing in the specified commercial papers from their respective suspension dates
- No transactions should be executed in these instruments on or after the "No Dealings From" date
- Market participants must update their trading systems to reflect these suspensions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to debt market participants holding or trading these specific commercial papers. The suspension is temporary and related to scheduled redemptions, so it represents normal market operations rather than any adverse event.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these commercial papers will have their instruments redeemed on the respective record dates. Trading suspension prevents any last-minute transactions that could complicate the redemption process.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems are updated to prevent inadvertent trading in these suspended securities. The concentration of 8 redemptions on November 18 may require additional operational attention on that date.
