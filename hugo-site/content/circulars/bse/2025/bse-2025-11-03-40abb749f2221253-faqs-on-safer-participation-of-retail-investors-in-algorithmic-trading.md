---

## Summary

BSE has published Version 1.0 of FAQs addressing queries related to safer participation of retail investors in algorithmic trading. The document clarifies empanelment criteria for algo providers, cyber incident declaration requirements, IP address requirements for retail clients, research analyst registration obligations for black box algos, and mandatory hosting requirements on broker servers.

## Key Points

- Empanelment criteria for Algo Providers detailed in BSE notice 20250922-19 dated September 22, 2025
- Algo Providers must provide self-declaration of cyber/adverse technical incidents for previous 3 years on their letterhead (no auditor certification required)
- Static IP required only for tech-savvy investors using API for order placement, not for all retail customers via algo vendors
- Research Analysts wishing to deploy black box algos must first register as Algo Providers and maintain detailed research reports
- Algo Providers cannot host black box algos of multiple third-party RAs
- All algorithmic trading strategies must be hosted on broker's servers with order messages originating from broker's server

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This FAQ document provides clarifications on existing requirements from:
- BSE notice 20250922-19 dated September 22, 2025
