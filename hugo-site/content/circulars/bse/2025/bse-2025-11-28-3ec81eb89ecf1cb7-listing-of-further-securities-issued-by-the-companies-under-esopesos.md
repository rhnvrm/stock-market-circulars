## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine listing of employee stock options that were already part of disclosed compensation schemes. The dilution impact would have been factored into market expectations when the ESOP/ESOS schemes were announced.

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal increase in tradable float across 13 companies. Hexaware Technologies sees the largest absolute increase with 2 million shares, while other companies have relatively smaller additions.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders may experience minor dilution, but this is standard practice for companies with employee stock option programs. The lack of lock-in period means shares are immediately available for trading.

**Company-Specific Impact:**
- Financial sector companies (AAVAS, AU Small Finance Bank, RBL Bank, SBI Life, UTI AMC) represent significant portion of listings
- Technology companies (Hexaware, Infosys, Prime Focus) also feature prominently
- Face values range from ₹1 to ₹10 depending on company
