## Summary

BSE has announced the resumption of trading in debentures of Shriram Finance Ltd with Scrip Codes 975128 and 975129, effective October 08, 2025. Trading was previously suspended following the record date (September 18, 2025) set for payment of interest and early redemption pursuant to exercise of put option. Since the company did not exercise the early redemption on the put option, normal trading will resume.

## Key Points

- Trading in debentures with Scrip Codes 975128 and 975129 to resume from October 08, 2025
- Early redemption on exercise of put option was not exercised by Shriram Finance Ltd
- This follows the previous suspension notice dated September 15, 2025 (Notice No. 20250915-70)
- Record date for interest payment and early redemption was September 18, 2025
- Trading members are advised to note this change for debt market operations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a procedural update regarding trading status of specific debt securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the availability of these debentures for trading from October 08, 2025
- Normal trading procedures and compliance requirements apply to these debt instruments

## Important Dates

- **September 15, 2025**: Original suspension notice issued (Notice No. 20250915-70)
- **September 18, 2025**: Record date for interest payment and early redemption
- **October 07, 2025**: Resumption notice issued
- **October 08, 2025**: Trading resumes for Scrip Codes 975128 and 975129

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This affects only specific debenture holders and traders dealing with these two scrip codes. The resumption of trading restores liquidity for these instruments.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the availability of these securities for trading. No significant operational changes required beyond routine processing.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for debenture holders who can now trade these securities on the exchange. The non-exercise of the early redemption option means the debentures continue as per original terms.
