- Record Date: January 2, 2026
- Sub-division ratio: 1 share of Rs.10/- into 5 shares of Rs.2/- each
- New face value: Rs.2/- per share (reduced from Rs.10/-)
- Effective date: January 2, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action (stock split) permitted under existing regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that the existing ISIN No. INE745G01035 (Rs.10/- paid up) will not be valid for transactions on the exchange on or after January 2, 2026
- All market participants must update their systems to reflect the new share structure and ISIN once communicated
- Demat accounts will be automatically credited with the subdivided shares in the ratio of 1:5

## Important Dates

- **December 22, 2025**: Notice issued
- **January 2, 2026**: Record date for sub-division
- **January 2, 2026**: Effective date - old ISIN becomes invalid, new paid-up value of Rs.2/- takes effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The sub-division will make MCX shares more affordable for retail investors by reducing the trading lot size and share price proportionally. This typically enhances liquidity and trading activity.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. The total value of their holdings remains unchanged, but the number of shares increases five-fold.

**Operational Impact**: Market participants and depositories need to update systems with the new ISIN and face value. Trading operations will transition to the new share structure from January 2, 2026.
