The extensions provide regulated entities additional time to implement digital accessibility requirements, reducing immediate compliance pressure. The consolidation of IA and RA reporting to BSE Ltd. streamlines the reporting process and may improve compliance monitoring efficiency. This is primarily an operational adjustment with minimal direct market impact but important for ensuring accessibility compliance across the securities market ecosystem.
