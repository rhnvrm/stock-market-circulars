## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in debt securities of two companies effective November 27, 2025, due to their upcoming maturity dates. The affected securities are debentures of JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd (maturing November 28, 2025) and Hiren Wahen Buildtech Private Limited (maturing November 30, 2025). Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Two debt securities will be suspended from trading on November 27, 2025
- JM Financial ARC debenture (ISIN: INE265J07555) with 10.21% coupon matures on November 28, 2025
- Hiren Wahen Buildtech debenture (ISIN: INE0S1Q07019) with 19% coupon matures on November 30, 2025
- Both are privately placed debentures
- Notice reference: DR-765/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational measure for securities reaching maturity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the specified debentures from November 27, 2025
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the suspension of these securities
- No new transactions should be executed in these debt scrips

## Important Dates

- **November 26, 2025**: Notice date

- **November 28, 2025**: Maturity date for JM Financial ARC debenture (Scrip Code: 975132)
- **November 30, 2025**: Maturity date for Hiren Wahen Buildtech debenture (Scrip Code: 975302)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a standard administrative action affecting only two privately placed debt securities approaching maturity. The suspension prevents trading in securities that will soon cease to exist.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to holders of these specific debentures who will receive principal and final interest payment upon maturity.
