title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Lower Revision of Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the lower revision of Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages for 56 securities effective November 7, 2025. The revision involves downgrading securities from higher surveillance stages to lower stages across multiple trading groups (X, Z, XT, M, MS, P, T, B). This indicates improved compliance and reduced surveillance concerns for the listed companies.

## Key Points

- 56 securities have been moved to lower GSM stages
- Revisions span across various trading groups: X, Z, XT, M, MS, P, T, and B
- Stage reductions include: Stage 4 to 3, Stage 3 to 2, Stage 2 to 1, and Stage 1 to 0
- Maximum number of securities (23) moved from Stage 4 to Stage 3
- 13 securities moved from Stage 2 to Stage 1
- 4 securities moved to Stage 0 (removed from GSM)
- Includes companies from diverse sectors: textiles, chemicals, technology, finance, and manufacturing

## Regulatory Changes

The lower revision of GSM stages reflects BSE's ongoing monitoring and adjustment of surveillance measures based on improved company performance and compliance. Securities moving to lower stages will face reduced surveillance restrictions, potentially including:

- Reduced margin requirements
- Fewer trading restrictions
- Improved market liquidity
- Enhanced investor confidence

Securities moved to Stage 0 are effectively removed from the GSM framework, indicating full compliance restoration.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements are imposed through this circular. The revision represents a relaxation of existing surveillance measures for the affected securities. Companies should continue to maintain the improved compliance standards that led to this favorable revision.

Market participants should note the revised GSM stages when trading these securities and adjust their risk management frameworks accordingly.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 7, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Market Impact**: This circular has a net positive impact on the affected securities and overall market sentiment. Key impacts include:

- **Enhanced Trading**: Lower GSM stages typically result in improved trading activity and liquidity for affected securities
- **Investor Confidence**: Downward stage revision signals improved corporate governance and compliance
- **Reduced Costs**: Lower margin requirements and trading restrictions benefit market participants
- **Market Stability**: Demonstrates BSE's dynamic surveillance approach rewarding improved compliance

The revision affects a diverse set of 56 companies across sectors, indicating broad-based improvement in compliance standards. Investors and traders can view this as a positive signal for the affected securities, though individual company fundamentals should still be evaluated independently.
