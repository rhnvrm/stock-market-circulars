## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - This part redemption will reduce the outstanding principal of the debenture series, affecting the liquidity and face value of the instrument. Investors holding these debentures will receive partial redemption proceeds along with accrued interest.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the reduced face value of Rs. 5,000 per debenture from October 13, 2025. The part redemption will reduce the debt exposure of MUTHOOT CAPITAL SERVICES LTD. and return capital to debenture holders. Investors should note that post-redemption, each debenture will have a lower face value, which will affect future interest calculations and the final redemption amount at maturity.
