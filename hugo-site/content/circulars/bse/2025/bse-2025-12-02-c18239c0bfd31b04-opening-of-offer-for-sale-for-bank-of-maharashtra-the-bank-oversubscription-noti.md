**Liquidity Impact:** The OFS will increase the free float of Bank of Maharashtra shares, potentially improving liquidity and trading volumes in the scrip.

**Investor Impact:** Provides institutional and retail investors an opportunity to acquire Bank of Maharashtra shares at discovered prices through transparent bidding mechanism. Oversubscription may lead to proportionate allotment.

**Sectoral Impact:** Part of broader government disinvestment agenda in public sector banking, signaling policy continuity in reducing government stake in PSU banks.
