## Impact Assessment

This is a routine commercial paper listing with minimal market impact. The issuance represents short-term funding for Kirloskar Ferrous Industries Limited with a strong credit rating of ICRA A1+. The instrument provides investors with a short-term debt investment option maturing in approximately 3 months. The discount to face value (issue price Rs. 4,92,191.82 vs face value Rs. 5,00,000) implies an annualized yield for investors. This listing expands the debt market offerings but is unlikely to have significant impact on broader market operations or the company's equity securities.
