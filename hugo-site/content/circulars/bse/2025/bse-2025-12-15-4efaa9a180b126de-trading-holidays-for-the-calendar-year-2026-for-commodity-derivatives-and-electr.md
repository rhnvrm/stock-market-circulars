## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The holiday schedule affects trading activity planning for all participants in Commodity Derivatives and EGR segments throughout 2026. The staggered closure pattern (some holidays closing only morning sessions) allows for continued evening trading opportunities.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading members, brokers, and market participants need to plan their operations, staffing, and client communications around these holidays. The advance notice allows adequate preparation time.

**Trading Opportunities:** The evening session remaining open on 11 out of 16 holidays provides continued market access and liquidity for participants who require it, particularly beneficial for commodities and gold trading which have global market linkages.

**Flexibility:** BSE reserves the right to alter or change any holidays with advance notice via separate circular, providing operational flexibility if needed.
