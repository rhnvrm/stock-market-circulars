## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies must ensure compliance with lock-in provisions
- Shares cannot be traded until respective lock-in expiry dates
- Companies must maintain records of ISIN ranges and lock-in periods

## Important Dates

- **December 16, 2025**: Lock-in expiry for 186,350 shares
- **December 17, 2025**: Lock-in expiry for 550,600 shares
- **November 24, 2025**: Listing date (circular publication)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. These are employee-issued securities with lock-in restrictions, representing routine corporate actions under ESOP/ESOS schemes. The shares will become tradable only after their respective lock-in periods expire in mid-December 2025. The quantities involved are relatively small and will be released gradually across two dates, minimizing any potential supply-side pressure on the market.
