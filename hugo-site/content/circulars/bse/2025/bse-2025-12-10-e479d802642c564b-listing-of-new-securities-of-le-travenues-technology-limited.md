- **Trading Commencement**: December 11, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The preferential issue represents a significant capital raise for Le Travenues Technology Limited. The addition of 4.63 crore shares will increase the company's equity base and may lead to dilution for existing shareholders.

**Liquidity Impact**: The 6-month lock-in period ensures that these shares will not immediately impact trading liquidity. Post lock-in expiry on June 11, 2026, there may be increased floating stock available for trading.

**Investor Consideration**: Existing shareholders should assess the dilution impact. The issue to non-promoters at Rs. 280 per share provides a reference price point for valuation. Investors should monitor how the capital raised is deployed by the company.
