## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Framework continues to be applied for securities showing abnormal price movements or unusual trading patterns. Securities may move out of ST-ASM if they are included in other surveillance frameworks including:
- LT-ASM Framework
- Trade for Trade Framework
- GSM Framework
- Pledge Framework
- ESM Framework

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the securities under ST-ASM framework for trading purposes
- Enhanced surveillance applies to all listed securities in the framework
- Special attention required for SME scrips and T+0 scrips marked in the framework
- Traders should review position limits and margin requirements for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 19, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The ST-ASM framework is designed to curb excessive speculation and protect investor interests in securities displaying unusual price or volume behavior. Securities placed under this framework face:

- Additional margin requirements
- Price bands restrictions
- Potential liquidity constraints
- Increased scrutiny from market surveillance

Investors holding positions in the newly added securities should be aware of stricter trading conditions. The movement of Welcure Drugs & Pharmaceuticals to a lower stage indicates improved trading behavior, while securities exiting the framework suggest normalization of trading patterns or migration to other surveillance measures.
