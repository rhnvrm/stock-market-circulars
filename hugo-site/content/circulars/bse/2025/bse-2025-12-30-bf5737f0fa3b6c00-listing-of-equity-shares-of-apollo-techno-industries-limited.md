## Impact Assessment

This listing notification has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains specifically to Apollo Techno Industries Limited. The staggered lock-in periods suggest a structured release of promoter or anchor investor holdings, which helps prevent sudden supply shocks. Approximately 19.3% of the total listed shares (2,639,000) are immediately available for free trading, while the remaining shares will become tradable gradually over the next three years.
