## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact:** Existing investors in the CRISIL-IBX AAA NBFC-HFC Index Dec 2025 Fund will see their holdings transferred to the CRISIL-IBX Financial Services 9-12 Months Debt Index Fund. Investment strategy and risk profile may change based on the transferee scheme's mandate.

**Operational Impact:** BSE StAR MF Platform and participating intermediaries need to update their systems to reflect the new ISIN mappings and scheme names. Transaction processing for the transferor scheme will cease post-merger.

**Market Impact:** Limited broader market impact as this is a scheme-specific consolidation activity affecting only specific mutual fund investors on the BSE platform.
