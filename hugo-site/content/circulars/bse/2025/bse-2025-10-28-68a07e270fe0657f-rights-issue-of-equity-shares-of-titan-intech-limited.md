## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will have the opportunity to subscribe to 3 new shares for every 2 shares held, representing a 150% rights offering. This is a significant dilution event for non-participating shareholders.

**Market Impact**: The stock will trade ex-rights from October 31, 2025, likely resulting in a price adjustment to reflect the rights offering value. Investors purchasing shares on or after this date will not be entitled to participate in the rights issue.

**Trading Impact**: The 3:2 ratio indicates substantial capital raising activity, which may impact stock liquidity and price dynamics during the ex-rights period.
