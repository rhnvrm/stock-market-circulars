## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures (ISIN: INE836B07782) from January 5, 2026 onwards
- Trading members are required to take note of the suspension and ensure compliance with the no-dealing directive
- All market participants must adhere to the record date of January 5, 2026 for determining eligibility for interest payment and redemption

## Important Dates

- **December 31, 2025**: Notice issued by BSE
- **January 5, 2026**: Record Date for interest payment and redemption eligibility
- **January 5, 2026**: Trading suspension becomes effective (no dealings permitted from this date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of the specific debenture series (SCNL-11%-13-01-26-PVT). The suspension affects only debt market participants dealing in this particular NCD and does not impact the company's equity shares or other debt instruments.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders as on the record date (January 5, 2026) will receive interest payment and principal redemption. No secondary market trading will be possible from the suspension date, restricting liquidity for investors wishing to exit before redemption.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trades in the specified ISIN and communicate the suspension to clients holding or interested in trading these debentures.
