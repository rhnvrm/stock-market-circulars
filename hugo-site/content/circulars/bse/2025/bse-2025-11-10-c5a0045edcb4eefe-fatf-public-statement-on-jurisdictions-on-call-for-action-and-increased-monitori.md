---

## Summary

BSE has communicated SEBI's update regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) October 2025 Plenary statements on jurisdictions with strategic Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CFT) deficiencies. Importantly, no new jurisdictions were added to the increased monitoring list, and four countries - Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria and South Africa - have been removed from FATF increased monitoring. Members are required to take note for necessary compliance actions.

## Key Points

- FATF released Public Statements following the October 2025 Plenary session
- No new jurisdictions identified for increased monitoring
- Four countries removed from increased monitoring: Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria and South Africa
- Public statements available on FATF website covering high-risk jurisdictions and jurisdictions under increased monitoring
- Members must review and implement necessary compliance measures

## Regulatory Changes

FATF has updated its lists of jurisdictions subject to enhanced due diligence requirements:

**Removals from Increased Monitoring:**
- Burkina Faso
- Mozambique
- Nigeria
- South Africa

These jurisdictions are no longer subject to FATF's increased monitoring framework, indicating improvement in their AML/CFT systems.

**No New Additions:** FATF did not identify any new jurisdictions for increased monitoring during this review cycle.

## Compliance Requirements

**For BSE Members:**

1. **Review FATF Public Statements:** Access and review the official FATF documents at:

   - Increased Monitoring Jurisdictions: https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/High-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions/increased-monitoring-october-2025.html

2. **Update Due Diligence Procedures:** Adjust customer due diligence and enhanced due diligence requirements for entities and transactions involving the updated jurisdiction lists

3. **Transaction Monitoring:** Review and update transaction monitoring systems to reflect the removal of the four jurisdictions from enhanced monitoring

4. **Documentation:** Maintain records of compliance measures taken in response to this circular

5. **Training:** Ensure compliance teams are aware of the updated FATF lists

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** November 10, 2025
- **Notice Number:** 20251110-17
- **FATF Plenary:** October 2025
- **Effective Date:** Immediate compliance required

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The removal of four countries from FATF's increased monitoring list may facilitate smoother cross-border transactions and reduce compliance burdens for transactions involving these jurisdictions.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Members need to:
- Update internal AML/CFT policies and procedures
- Revise risk assessment frameworks for the affected jurisdictions
- Potentially reduce enhanced due diligence requirements for clients from removed jurisdictions
- Adjust transaction monitoring parameters

**Compliance Impact:** Positive - The removal of these jurisdictions from increased monitoring indicates reduced risk levels, potentially lowering compliance costs for transactions with entities from Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, and South Africa.
