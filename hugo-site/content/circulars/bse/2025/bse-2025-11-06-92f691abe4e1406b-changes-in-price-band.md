## Regulatory Changes

The price band mechanism restricts the maximum price movement allowed for a security during a trading session. A 5% price band means the stock can move only 5% up or down from its previous closing price, while a 10% band allows movement up to 10% in either direction. These bands are typically applied as surveillance measures for stocks exhibiting unusual volatility or requiring additional monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure their systems are updated to reflect the revised price bands before market opening on November 7, 2025
- Orders exceeding the new price band limits will be rejected
- Members should inform their clients about the revised trading restrictions
- Any clarifications should be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 6, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 7, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The revised price bands will restrict intraday volatility for these 9 securities. Stocks with 5% bands will have more stringent limits compared to those with 10% bands. This may reduce speculative trading activity and provide price stability.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware that intraday price movements will be capped at the specified percentages. This protects against extreme volatility but may also limit profit opportunities during high-momentum trading sessions.

**Market Operations**: Brokers and trading systems must update their risk management parameters and order validation systems to accommodate the new price bands before the effective date.
