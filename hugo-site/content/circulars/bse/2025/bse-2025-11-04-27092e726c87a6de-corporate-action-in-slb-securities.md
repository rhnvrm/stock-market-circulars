## Impact Assessment

**Market Operations:** SLB participants with open positions in these 16 securities must plan for mandatory position closure, which may impact their lending/borrowing strategies and hedging activities.

**Liquidity:** Temporary reduction in SLB liquidity for affected securities during shut periods, potentially affecting short-selling and arbitrage strategies.

**Settlement Risk:** Foreclosure mechanism ensures smooth settlement of corporate actions and prevents complications arising from open SLB positions during record dates.

**Trading Strategy:** Traders and market makers need to adjust their positions ahead of shut periods to avoid forced closures and potential penalties.
