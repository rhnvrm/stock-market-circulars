## Impact Assessment

This circular facilitates liquidity for Adani Enterprises rights issue participants by enabling trading of rights entitlements. Shareholders who do not wish to subscribe can renounce their rights during the trading period. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade mechanism ensures controlled trading environment. The requirement for prominent disclaimers protects retail investors from confusion between REs and ordinary shares. The specific 11-day trading window (Nov 25 - Dec 5) provides adequate time for market participants to make informed decisions before the rights issue closes on December 10, 2025.
