## Impact Assessment

The corporate actions will temporarily restrict SLB activities in the affected securities during their respective shut periods.

The stock split for MCX will require adjustment of SLB contracts, while dividend actions for TCS and CAMS will affect the valuation of borrowed securities during the shut periods.
