## Summary

BSE has listed further securities issued by 5 companies under their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). These new equity shares will be admitted for trading on the Exchange effective Wednesday, October 8, 2025. The issuances range from 25,063 shares (InterGlobe Aviation) to 576,888 shares (IDFC FIRST Bank), with varying lock-in periods.

## Key Points

- **Bliss GVS Pharma Limited**: 39,950 shares of ₹1 face value listed, under lock-in until March 15, 2026
- **Federal Bank Ltd**: 44,995 shares of ₹2 face value listed, no lock-in period
- **IDFC FIRST Bank Limited**: 576,888 shares of ₹10 face value listed, no lock-in period (largest issuance)

- **Smartworks Coworking Spaces Limited**: 123,100 shares of ₹10 face value listed, no lock-in period
- Trading commences on October 8, 2025 for all listed securities

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to enable trading of these securities from October 8, 2025
- Shares under lock-in (Bliss GVS Pharma) cannot be transferred until the specified date
- All securities have been assigned specific ISIN numbers and distribution number ranges

## Important Dates

- **October 7, 2025**: Circular notice date
- **October 8, 2025**: Effective date for listing and trading of all mentioned securities
- **March 15, 2026**: Lock-in expiry date for Bliss GVS Pharma Limited shares

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. ESOP/ESOS issuances are routine corporate actions representing small percentages of total share capital. The quantities are relatively small compared to typical daily trading volumes of these companies.

**Operational Impact**: Nil for investors. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new securities.

**Dilution Effect**: Negligible dilution to existing shareholders given the small quantities relative to outstanding shares. IDFC FIRST Bank has the largest issuance at 576,888 shares, but this represents minimal dilution for a large bank.

**Lock-in Consideration**: Only Bliss GVS Pharma shares are under lock-in until March 2026, restricting immediate supply to the market.
