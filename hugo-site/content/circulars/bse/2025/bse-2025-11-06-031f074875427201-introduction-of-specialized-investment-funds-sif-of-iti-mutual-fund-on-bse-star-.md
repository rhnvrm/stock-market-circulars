title: Monitoring of Minimum Investment Threshold under Specialized Investment Funds
  (SIF)
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued detailed guidelines for monitoring compliance with the Minimum Investment Threshold of INR 10 lakh under Specialized Investment Funds (SIF). The circular establishes a mechanism where active breaches result in unit freezing, a 30-day rebalancing notice period, and automatic redemption if non-compliance persists. This framework ensures continuous compliance with minimum investment requirements while providing investors an opportunity to rectify breaches.

## Key Points

- AMCs must monitor compliance with Minimum Investment Threshold (INR 10 lakh) on a daily basis
- Active breach occurs when investor's total investment falls below INR 10 lakh due to investor-initiated transactions (redemption, transfer, sale)
- Upon active breach, all units across investment strategies of the concerned SIF are frozen for debit
- Investor receives 30 calendar days notice to rebalance investments to meet minimum threshold
- If investor rebalances within 30 days, units are unfrozen with no further action
- Failure to rebalance results in automatic redemption at NAV of next business day after 30-day notice period
- AMCs, RTAs, and Depositories must implement necessary systems for this framework

## Regulatory Changes

This circular supplements the SIF Circular dated February 27, 2025, and subsequent circulars dated April 09, 2025 and April 11, 2025. Key regulatory changes include:

- **Active Breach Definition**: Formally defines "Active Breach" as fall in aggregate investment value below INR 10 lakh across all investment strategies of a SIF due to investor-initiated transactions
- **Automated Enforcement Mechanism**: Introduces systematic freeze-notice-redemption process replacing manual monitoring
- **Cross-Strategy Monitoring**: Breach monitoring applies across all investment strategies within a SIF, not individual strategies
- **Mandatory Unit Freezing**: Requires immediate freezing of all SIF units for debit upon breach detection

## Compliance Requirements

**For Asset Management Companies (AMCs):**
- Implement daily monitoring systems for Minimum Investment Threshold compliance
- Ensure no active breaches remain unaddressed
- Freeze units immediately upon detecting active breach
- Issue 30-day notice to non-compliant investors
- Execute automatic redemption if breach not rectified within notice period
- Prevent investor redemptions that would cause breach below minimum threshold

**For Registrar and Transfer Agents (RTAs):**
- Establish systems to support daily threshold monitoring
- Implement unit freezing/unfreezing mechanisms
- Process automatic redemptions as per circular requirements

**For Depositories:**
- Put in place necessary systems for implementation of monitoring framework
- Support freeze and automatic redemption processes

**For Investors:**
- Maintain minimum investment of INR 10 lakh across all SIF investment strategies
- Respond to breach notices within 30 calendar days by adding funds
- Understand that non-response results in automatic redemption

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: July 29, 2025
- **Effective Date**: July 29, 2025 (immediate effect)
- **Notice Period for Breach Rectification**: 30 calendar days from breach notice
- **Automatic Redemption**: Next immediate business day after 30th calendar day of notice period
- **Referenced Circulars**: February 27, 2025 (SIF Circular), April 09, 2025, April 11, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Establishes clear enforcement mechanism for SIF minimum investment requirements
- May result in forced redemptions for investors unable to maintain minimum threshold
- Provides 30-day window reducing immediate liquidity pressure on funds
- Enhances regulatory certainty for SIF product design and operations

**Operational Impact:**
- Requires significant system upgrades by AMCs, RTAs, and Depositories for daily monitoring
- Introduces automated workflows for breach detection, notification, and redemption
- Reduces manual intervention and potential compliance gaps
- Necessitates investor education about minimum threshold maintenance

**Investor Impact:**
- Prevents inadvertent fall below minimum investment through transaction restrictions
- Provides clear remediation path (30-day rebalancing window)
- Risk of automatic redemption if minimum not maintained
- Affects investors using stock exchange transactions or off-market transfers

**Regulatory Impact:**
- Strengthens SIF framework integrity by ensuring consistent minimum investment compliance
- Protects investor interests through structured enforcement mechanism
- Issued under Section 11(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Chapter VI-C of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations 1996
