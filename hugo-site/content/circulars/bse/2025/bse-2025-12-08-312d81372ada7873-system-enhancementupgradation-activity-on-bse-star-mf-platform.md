## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - The 3-hour maintenance window will temporarily disrupt mutual fund trading activities on the BSE StAR MF Platform. Fresh and additional purchase orders cannot be executed, and new SIP/XSIP registrations cannot be processed during this period.

**Market Impact**: Low to Medium - The impact is limited as the downtime is scheduled during late trading hours (3:00 PM to 6:00 PM) and affects only the mutual fund segment. Members have advance notice to plan their activities and inform clients.

**Mitigation**: Members can execute urgent orders before 3:00 PM or after 6:00 PM on the same day, or defer non-urgent transactions to the following trading day.
