## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The quantities being listed represent a small fraction of the total outstanding shares of these companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in float for the respective companies, with most shares having no lock-in restrictions and immediately available for trading.

**Shareholder Impact**: Dilution effect is minimal given the relatively small number of shares compared to existing equity base. Employees receiving these shares can monetize their holdings (subject to lock-in periods).

**Operational Impact**: No operational changes required for trading members beyond noting the availability of additional shares for trading.
