title: Change in Status of Era Infra Engineering Ltd from Delisted to Suspended
---

## Summary

BSE has announced a change in the status of Era Infra Engineering Ltd (Scrip Code: 530323) from "Delisted" to "Suspended" effective December 1, 2025. This change is necessitated by a moratorium declared by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The company was originally delisted from BSE on July 4, 2018.

## Key Points

- Era Infra Engineering Ltd was delisted from BSE on July 4, 2018 (Notice No. 20180702-28)
- Status will change from "Delisted" to "Suspended" due to NCLT moratorium order
- Scrip Code: 530323
- Trading members requiring clarification can email bse.delistscn@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

The company's listing status classification will be updated from "Delisted" to "Suspended" in BSE's systems. This administrative change reflects the legal proceedings and moratorium imposed by NCLT.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are informed of this status change for their records. No specific action is required from trading members, but they may seek clarification via email if needed.

## Important Dates

- **July 4, 2018**: Original delisting date of Era Infra Engineering Ltd
- **November 27, 2025**: Notice date
- **December 1, 2025**: Effective date of status change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited as the company has already been delisted since 2018 and is not actively traded. The status change is primarily an administrative update reflecting ongoing legal proceedings under NCLT. This does not affect current market operations or active trading members' activities.
