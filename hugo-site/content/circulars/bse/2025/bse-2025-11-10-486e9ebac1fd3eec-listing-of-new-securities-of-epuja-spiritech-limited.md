## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a relatively small preferential issue representing conversion of warrants. The lock-in period until May 31, 2026 ensures these shares cannot be traded immediately, minimizing any short-term market impact.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Standard listing procedure for trading members with no changes to existing trading protocols.

**Investor Impact**: The preferential allotment to non-promoters increases the non-promoter shareholding in the company. Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect of 12,00,000 additional shares in circulation.
