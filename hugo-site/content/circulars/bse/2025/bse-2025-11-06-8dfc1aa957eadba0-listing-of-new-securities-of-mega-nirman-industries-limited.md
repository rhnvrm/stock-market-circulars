## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: July 25, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine listing of preferentially allotted shares following warrant conversion. The number of shares represents a dilution to existing shareholders but is a standard corporate action.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new shares. The lock-in periods ensure these shares cannot be traded immediately, limiting near-term liquidity impact.

**Investor Impact**: The allotment to non-promoters increases the public float. Lock-in periods extending to May 2026 provide stability and prevent immediate selling pressure. Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect and pari-passu ranking of new shares.
