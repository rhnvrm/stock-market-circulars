---

## Summary

BSE has announced revisions to price bands for 102 securities in the equity segment, effective from August 25, 2025. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20%, replacing the existing levels for these scrips.

## Key Points

- 102 securities will have revised price bands effective August 25, 2025
- Price band percentages range from 2% (lowest) to 20% (highest)
- Majority of securities (74) will have a 5% price band
- 15 securities will have enhanced price bands of 10% or 20%
- 4 securities will have reduced price bands of 2%

## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions represent changes to daily price movement limits for the affected securities. These bands control the maximum percentage a stock price can move up or down in a single trading session.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with the revised price bands
- All trading systems must be updated to reflect the new price band limits
- Members should inform clients about the revised trading parameters

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** August 22, 2025
- **Effective Date:** August 25, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will affect trading dynamics for these 102 securities. Securities with reduced price bands (2%) may experience more constrained price movements, while those with increased bands (10-20%) may see higher volatility potential. This could impact trading strategies, risk management, and market liquidity for the affected stocks.
