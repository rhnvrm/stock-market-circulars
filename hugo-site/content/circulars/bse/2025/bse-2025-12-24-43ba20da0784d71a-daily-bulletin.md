- Trading members should note the record dates for client servicing
- One corporate action cancelled (Bajaj Financial Securities CP redemption on March 19, 2026) - members should update systems accordingly

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative bulletin with minimal market impact. The announcements primarily affect debt security holders and do not materially impact equity trading operations. The cancellation and rescheduling of one Bajaj Financial Securities CP redemption is a minor administrative adjustment. Investors and trading members should note the dates for settlement and entitlement purposes.
