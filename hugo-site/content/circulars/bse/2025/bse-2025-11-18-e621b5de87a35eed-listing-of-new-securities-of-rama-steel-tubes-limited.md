## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The preferential allotment of approximately 7.78 crore shares represents a significant increase in the equity base of Rama Steel Tubes Limited, which will impact the shareholding pattern and potentially dilute existing shareholders' stakes.

**Liquidity Impact**: The immediate trading impact may be limited due to the lock-in period extending until June 14, 2026, preventing these shares from being traded until then. Post lock-in expiry, increased float may improve liquidity.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders face dilution from this substantial preferential allotment to non-promoters. The issue price of Rs. 11.25 per share will be a key consideration for valuation assessment.
