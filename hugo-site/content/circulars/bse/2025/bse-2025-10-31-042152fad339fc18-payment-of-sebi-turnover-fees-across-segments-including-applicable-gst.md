## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members must ensure adequate liquidity in settlement accounts by November 06, 2025 to avoid payment failures. This is a routine monthly obligation affecting all trading members across all segments.

**Financial Impact**: Member-specific - Impact varies based on individual trading member's turnover across different segments. GST at 18% increases the total fee burden by approximately one-fifth of the base SEBI turnover fee.

**Administrative Impact**: Low - Established process with clear timelines and file formats. Members familiar with monthly cycle should face minimal administrative burden.
