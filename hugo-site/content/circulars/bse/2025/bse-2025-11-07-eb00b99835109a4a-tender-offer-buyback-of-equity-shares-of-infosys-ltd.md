- Shares will trade ex-entitlement from November 14, 2025

## Important Dates

- **November 7, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **November 14, 2025**: Record date for buyback eligibility
- **November 14, 2025**: Ex-entitlement date (Settlement DR-756/2025-2026)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Buyback announcements by large-cap companies like Infosys typically influence stock price movements and trading volumes. Investors need to hold shares before the ex-entitlement date to participate.

**Shareholder Impact**: Shareholders must ensure their holdings are settled by the record date to be eligible for the buyback offer. Those purchasing shares on or after November 14, 2025 will not be entitled to participate.

**Trading Impact**: Expected increased trading activity leading up to the ex-entitlement date as investors position themselves for buyback participation.
