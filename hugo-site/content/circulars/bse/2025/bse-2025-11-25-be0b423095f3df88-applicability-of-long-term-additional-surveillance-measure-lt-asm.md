## Summary

BSE has announced updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective November 26, 2025. Four securities have been newly shortlisted for LT-ASM, one security (Omnipotent Industries Ltd) will be moved to a higher ASM Stage II, and one security (Gopal Iron & Steels Company Gujarat Ltd) is moving out of the framework due to inclusion in GSM Framework.

## Key Points

- 4 new securities shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Bharatrohan Airborne Innovations Ltd (544535), Hanman Fit Ltd (538731), M P K Steels (I) Ltd (544553), and Virat Leasing Ltd (539167)
- Omnipotent Industries Ltd (543400) moves from current stage to ASM Stage II
- Gopal Iron & Steels Company Gujarat Ltd (531913) exits LT-ASM Framework due to GSM Framework inclusion
- No securities moving to lower ASM stages
- No securities moving directly to Stage IV
- Consolidated list includes securities across ASM Stages I and IV

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework continues to monitor securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or trading patterns over extended periods. Securities under this framework face enhanced surveillance measures with specific trading restrictions based on their assigned ASM stage.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of securities under LT-ASM and their respective stages
- Different price bands and margin requirements apply to securities in different ASM stages
- Investors trading in these securities should understand the increased surveillance and potential trading restrictions
- Securities marked with special indicators (T+0 scrips, GSM inclusion) require additional compliance attention

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 26, 2025 - All changes to LT-ASM Framework take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Trading volumes and liquidity may be affected for the newly added securities and those moving to higher ASM stages. Stage II classification for Omnipotent Industries Ltd will result in stricter trading conditions including higher margins and tighter price bands.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new ASM classifications. Investors holding positions in affected securities should be aware of potential trading restrictions and increased margin requirements.

**Investor Impact**: Securities under LT-ASM face reduced liquidity and higher transaction costs due to surveillance measures. The exit of Gopal Iron & Steels from LT-ASM (due to GSM inclusion) indicates continued surveillance under a different framework.
