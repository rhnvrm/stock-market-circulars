**Investor Impact**: Relevant only for institutional investors who participated in the private placement. The high face value (Rs. 1 lakh per unit) and private placement nature indicate this is designed for large institutional participants.

**Credit Quality**: The ICRA AAA/STABLE rating indicates highest credit quality with low credit risk, making these securities attractive for debt investors seeking stable returns.
