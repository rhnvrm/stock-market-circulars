## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited market impact as this affects only specific debenture holders of KEERTANA FINSERV LIMITED. The part redemption will return capital to debenture holders while reducing the outstanding principal amount.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure their systems reflect the reduced face value of Rs. 6,800 per debenture from November 18, 2025. The reduction in face value indicates partial principal repayment to investors.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders on record will receive both accrued interest payment and partial redemption of principal. The reduced face value suggests return of capital while the debentures remain outstanding until maturity in April 2027.
