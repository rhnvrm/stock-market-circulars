The new ISIN INE671K01027 will be effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of October 17, 2025. This follows the company's subdivision of equity shares from a face value of Rs.10/- to Rs.2/- each.

## Key Points

- Company Name: SUNRAKSHAKK INDUSTRIES INDIA LIMITED
- Scrip Code: 539300
- New ISIN Number: INE671K01027
- Subdivision Ratio: Rs.10/- face value to Rs.2/- face value
- Ex-Date: October 17, 2025
- Document Reference: DR-738/2025-2026
- Continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251008-49 dated October 08, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action notice for ISIN change following share sub-division as per existing SEBI and exchange regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number INE671K01027
- All trades executed on or after October 17, 2025 must use the new ISIN
- Settlement and clearing systems must be updated to reflect the new share denomination of Rs.2/- per equity share

## Important Dates

- **Previous Notice:** October 08, 2025 (Exchange Notice No. 20251008-49)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x (from Rs.10 to Rs.2 face value), potentially improving liquidity and making shares more affordable to retail investors. The stock price will adjust proportionately on the ex-date.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading members, custodians, and depositories need to ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN before the ex-date to prevent settlement failures. Existing shareholders will see their holdings multiplied by 5 with a corresponding reduction in price per share.
