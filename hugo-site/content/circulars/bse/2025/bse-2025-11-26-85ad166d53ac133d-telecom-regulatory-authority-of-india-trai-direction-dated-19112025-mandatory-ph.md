title: TRAI Mandates Phase-wise Adoption of 1600-Series Numbers for BFSI Sector Entities
---

## Summary

TRAI has issued a Direction on November 19, 2025, mandating phase-wise adoption of the 1600-series numbering for service and transactional calls by entities regulated by RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA. This initiative aims to enhance consumer trust, curb spam, and prevent fraudulent activities by enabling citizens to reliably identify legitimate calls from regulated financial institutions. Approximately 485 entities have already adopted the series with over 2,800 numbers subscribed.

## Key Points

- The 1600-series has been assigned by DoT specifically for BFSI sector entities and Government organizations
- About 485 entities have already adopted 1600 series with over 2,800 numbers subscribed
- Phase-wise implementation schedule issued after consultations with Joint Committee of Regulators (JCoR)
- Aims to distinguish legitimate service and transactional calls from commercial communications
- Insurance sector adoption timeline under discussion with IRDAI, to be notified separately
- Series enables citizens to reliably identify calls from trusted financial institutions
- Voluntary migration available for other SEBI-registered intermediaries not covered by mandatory deadlines

## Regulatory Changes

TRAI has mandated time-bound adoption of 1600-series numbers through official Direction, moving from voluntary to mandatory compliance for specified BFSI sector entities. This marks a significant regulatory shift requiring all covered entities to migrate from standard 10-digit numbers to the designated 1600-series for their service and transactional calls.

## Compliance Requirements

**SEBI-Regulated Entities:**
- All Mutual Funds and Asset Management Companies (AMCs) must complete adoption by February 15, 2026
- All Qualified Stockbrokers (QSBs) must complete adoption by March 15, 2026
- Other SEBI-registered intermediaries may voluntarily migrate after verification of registration details

**RBI-Regulated Entities:**
- Commercial Banks (Public Sector, Private Sector, and Foreign Banks) must onboard by January 1, 2026
- Large NBFCs (asset size above ₹5,000 crore), Payments Banks, and Small Finance Banks must onboard by February 1, 2026
- Remaining NBFCs, Co-operative Banks, Regional Rural Banks, and smaller entities must onboard by March 1, 2026

**PFRDA-Regulated Entities:**
- Central Recordkeeping Agencies (CRAs) and Pension Fund Managers must onboard by February 15, 2026

## Important Dates

- **January 1, 2026**: Commercial Banks (PSU, Private, Foreign) adoption deadline
- **February 1, 2026**: Large NBFCs (>₹5,000 cr assets), Payments Banks, Small Finance Banks adoption deadline
- **February 15, 2026**: Mutual Funds and AMCs adoption deadline; CRAs and Pension Fund Managers adoption deadline
- **March 1, 2026**: Remaining NBFCs, Co-operative Banks, Regional Rural Banks adoption deadline
- **March 15, 2026**: Qualified Stockbrokers (QSBs) adoption deadline

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - affects all major financial institutions including listed banks, mutual funds, AMCs, stockbrokers, NBFCs, and pension fund entities. Entities must ensure technical infrastructure readiness and customer communication updates.

**Operational Impact:** Entities need to coordinate with Telecom Service Providers for number allocation, update their calling systems, modify customer communication materials, and educate customers about the new numbering series. Failure to comply by deadlines could affect customer service operations.

**Consumer Protection Impact:** Positive - significantly improves consumer safety by enabling easy identification of legitimate calls from financial institutions, reducing impersonation-based financial frauds and building trust in financial sector communications.

**Compliance Impact:** Mandatory compliance with strict timelines requires immediate action planning by covered entities. Non-compliance could result in regulatory action and inability to make service/transactional calls through standard numbers.
