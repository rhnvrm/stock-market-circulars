## Summary

BSE has issued a notice regarding the change in status of Noble Polymers Limited (Scrip Code: 539200) following an order from the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). The delisting of the company has been rescinded, and consequently, the company's status will be changed from "Delisted" to "Suspended" with effect from November 13, 2025. This change means that the provisions of Regulation 24(1) and Regulation 24(2) of the SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 will no longer be applicable to the company.

- Regulation 24(1) and Regulation 24(2) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 are no longer applicable to the company

## Compliance Requirements

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 11, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to shareholders and stakeholders of Noble Polymers Limited. The change from delisted to suspended status provides a potential path for the company to eventually resume trading, subject to compliance with listing requirements.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may have renewed hope for liquidity as the company is no longer permanently delisted. However, the suspended status still restricts trading until further regulatory actions are completed.

**Legal Impact**: The SAT order overturns the previous delisting decision, indicating successful legal recourse by the company or affected parties. This sets a precedent for similar cases where delisting decisions may be challenged through appellate mechanisms.
