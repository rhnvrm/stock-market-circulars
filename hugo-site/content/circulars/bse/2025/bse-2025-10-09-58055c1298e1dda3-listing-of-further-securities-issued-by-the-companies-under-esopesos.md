title: Listing of Further Securities Issued Under ESOP/ESOS - Five Companies
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the listing and admission for trading of further securities issued by five companies under their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). The new shares will be available for trading from Friday, October 10, 2025. All listed shares have no lock-in period restrictions.

## Key Points

- **ICICI Lombard General Insurance**: 96,554 shares (Face Value: ₹10, Scrip Code: 540716)
- **Kirloskar Industries Ltd**: 82,034 shares (Face Value: ₹10, Scrip Code: 500243)
- **Quick Heal Technologies**: 13,783 shares (Face Value: ₹10, Scrip Code: 539678)
- **Rishabh Instruments**: 60,000 shares (Face Value: ₹10, Scrip Code: 543977)
- **Tata Motors Ltd**: 56,720 shares (Face Value: ₹2, Scrip Code: 500570)
- Total of 309,091 new shares across five companies
- None of the shares are subject to lock-in restrictions

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities availability
- Companies have completed necessary compliance for ESOP/ESOS share issuance
- Shares are fully tradeable with no restrictions from listing date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 9, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: October 10, 2025 (Friday)
- **Lock-in Period**: Not Applicable (NA) for all securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The additional shares represent a very small percentage of each company's total outstanding equity. For example, Tata Motors' 56,720 new shares are negligible compared to its total equity base of over 3.68 billion shares.

**Liquidity Impact**: Neutral to slightly positive. The additional shares may marginally increase float but are unlikely to materially affect trading volumes or liquidity.

**Dilution**: Minimal dilution effect given the small quantum of shares relative to existing equity base for all companies.

**Employee Benefit**: Reflects successful execution of employee compensation plans, potentially positive for employee retention and motivation at these companies.
