---

## Summary

BSE has announced the removal of SKN Industries Limited from its Dissemination Board effective Monday, August 18, 2025. This action is taken pursuant to SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/DSA/CIR/P/2016/110 dated October 10, 2016, as the company has exercised its exit option.

## Key Points

- SKN Industries Limited (CIN: U27320DL1992PLC050472) will be removed from BSE Dissemination Board
- Company shares will no longer be available on the Exchange's Dissemination Board
- Removal is due to the company exercising its exit option
- Escrow account will remain open for one year as per SEBI regulations

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This action follows existing SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/DSA/CIR/P/2016/110 dated October 10, 2016 regarding exclusively listed companies.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members requiring clarifications on exit option should contact designated officials
- Company must maintain escrow account for one year period
- Standard exit option procedures as per SEBI guidelines to be followed

## Important Dates

- **August 18, 2025**: Effective date for removal from Dissemination Board
- **One year from removal**: Escrow account closure date

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this affects only one exclusively listed company. Trading members lose access to SKN Industries shares on BSE Dissemination Board, but standard exit option procedures provide investor protection through maintained escrow account.
