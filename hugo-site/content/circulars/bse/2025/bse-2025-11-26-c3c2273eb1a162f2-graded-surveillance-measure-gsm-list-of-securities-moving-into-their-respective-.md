title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Securities Moving to Stages I, II, and
  III
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of 9 securities into various stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. This includes 3 securities moving to GSM Stage I, 3 securities to GSM Stage II, and 3 securities to GSM Stage III. The GSM framework is designed to enhance market surveillance and protect investor interests by imposing additional restrictions on securities exhibiting unusual market behavior.

## Key Points

- 9 securities are being moved into different GSM stages effective immediately
- 3 securities moved to GSM Stage I: Kapil Cotex Ltd, Phaarmasia Ltd, Shivansh Finserve Ltd
- 3 securities moved to GSM Stage II: Sungold Capital Ltd, Gopal Iron & Steels Company Gujarat Ltd, Soni Medicare Ltd
- 3 securities moved to GSM Stage III: Cresanto Global Ltd, Nagarjuna Agri Tech Ltd, Senthil Infotek Ltd
- Securities may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure) or IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) frameworks

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework imposes progressive restrictions as securities move through stages:

- **Stage I**: Additional disclosure requirements and price bands
- **Stage II**: Stricter surveillance with reduced price bands and periodic call auctions
- **Stage III**: More stringent restrictions including 100% upfront margin requirements and trade-for-trade settlement

Higher GSM stages indicate increased regulatory concern and require enhanced monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with GSM-specific margin and settlement requirements for affected securities
- Investors trading in GSM securities must provide 100% upfront margins as applicable to the respective stage
- Market participants should be aware that securities in higher GSM stages have restricted liquidity and higher trading costs
- Brokers must inform clients about the implications of trading in GSM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 26, 2025 (as per circular date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High impact on the 9 affected securities with significantly reduced liquidity and trading flexibility. Securities in Stage III face the most severe restrictions with trade-for-trade settlement and 100% margin requirements, which typically leads to reduced trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may face difficulty exiting positions due to reduced liquidity. New investors face higher entry barriers due to margin requirements and trading restrictions.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update systems to enforce appropriate margins and settlement procedures for these securities.
