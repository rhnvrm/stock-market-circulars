## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a company-specific takeover offer affecting only EMA INDIA LTD shareholders. The offer size of 2.61 lakh shares is relatively small and unlikely to have broader market implications.

**Operational Impact**: Medium for participating members. Trading members and custodians need to ensure proper UCC registration, platform access, and compliance with bidding procedures during the 14-day offer period.

**Investor Impact**: Relevant only to current EMA INDIA LTD shareholders holding shares in demat form who wish to participate in the takeover offer at Rs. 124 per share, representing a specific exit opportunity at the stated price.
