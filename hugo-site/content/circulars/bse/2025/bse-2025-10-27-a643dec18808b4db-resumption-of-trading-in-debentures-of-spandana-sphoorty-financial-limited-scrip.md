BSE announces the resumption of trading in three series of debentures of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited (Scrip Codes: 975811, 974793 and 974502) effective October 28, 2025. Trading had been suspended following the company's request to fix a record date of October 8, 2025 for optional accelerated redemption of these debentures. The company has now requested resumption of trading in the outstanding debentures.

- Normal trading operations to apply from October 28, 2025 for Scrip Codes: 975811, 974793 and 974502

## Important Dates

- **October 6, 2025**: Original notice (20251006-62) announcing record date and trading suspension
- **October 8, 2025**: Record date for optional accelerated redemption
- **October 27, 2025**: Notice date for trading resumption

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this affects only three specific debenture series of one issuer. Holders of these debentures will regain liquidity and ability to trade from October 28, 2025. The resumption indicates that the optional accelerated redemption process for the record date has been completed, and remaining outstanding debentures will return to normal trading. Impact is confined to existing debenture holders and potential investors in these specific instruments.
