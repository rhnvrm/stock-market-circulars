## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it announces a routine NFO launch. The impact is limited to BSE StAR MF Platform members and investors interested in sector-specific ETF exposure to the chemicals industry through the NIFTY CHEMICALS index. The availability of both regular and direct plan options provides flexibility for different investor segments. Standard operational procedures apply with clear timelines for fund settlements and transaction processing.
