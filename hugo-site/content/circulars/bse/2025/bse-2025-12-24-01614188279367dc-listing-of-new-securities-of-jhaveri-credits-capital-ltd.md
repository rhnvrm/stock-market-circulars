Minimal market impact expected. This is a relatively small issuance representing additional equity shares from warrant conversion. The shares are subject to a lock-in period until June 30, 2026, preventing immediate selling pressure. The issuance to non-promoters on preferential basis is a standard capital raising mechanism. Trading members can facilitate transactions in these securities starting December 26, 2025.
