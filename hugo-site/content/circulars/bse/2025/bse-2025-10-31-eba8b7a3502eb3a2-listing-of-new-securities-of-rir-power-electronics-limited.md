No regulatory changes announced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the listing of new securities
- All 2,835,150 shares are subject to lock-in restrictions until May 30, 2026
- Shares issued under preferential allotment regulations to non-promoters

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment**: September 12, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: November 3, 2025 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Expiry Date**: May 30, 2026
- **Circular Notice Date**: October 31, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing notification for preferential allotment shares. The lock-in period until May 30, 2026 means these shares cannot be traded freely until then, limiting immediate supply-side pressure.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact as all issued shares are locked in for approximately 7 months from the trading commencement date.

**Shareholder Impact**: Dilutive to existing shareholders as 2.84 million new shares have been issued to non-promoters, though the shares were issued via warrant conversion indicating prior commitment and pricing.
