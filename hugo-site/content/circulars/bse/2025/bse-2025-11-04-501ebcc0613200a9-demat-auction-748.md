## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 104 securities with varying liquidity profiles. High-volume auctions (Vantage Knowledge with 31,060 shares, Cressanda Rail with 18,341 shares) may experience temporary price volatility.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Affects brokers and clearing members who have short delivery positions in these specific securities. They must arrange for securities or participate in the auction to close positions.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Direct impact limited to investors whose trades are subject to auction. May result in additional costs if auction prices are unfavorable. Blue-chip stocks like State Bank of India (8 shares), Maruti Suzuki (5 shares), and Exide Industries (320 shares) show minimal quantities suggesting isolated delivery failures.
