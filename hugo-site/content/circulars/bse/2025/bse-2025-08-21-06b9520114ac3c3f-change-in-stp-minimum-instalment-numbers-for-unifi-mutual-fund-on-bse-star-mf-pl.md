## Summary

Unifi Mutual Fund has announced a reduction in the minimum number of instalments for Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) under their Liquid Fund from 12 to 6 instalments, effective from a date to be announced in 2025.

## Key Points

- Minimum STP instalments reduced from 12 to 6 for Unifi Liquid Fund
- Applies to both Direct and Regular Plan Growth Options
- Monthly frequency with minimum amount of Rs. 1000 and multiples of Re. 1
- STP can be scheduled on any day except 29th, 30th and 31st
- Change requires addendum to Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)

## Regulatory Changes

Modification to the STP facility parameters in the scheme documents:
- Previous minimum instalments: 12
- New minimum instalments: 6
- All other terms and conditions remain unchanged including risk-o-meter

## Compliance Requirements

- Application forms for Unifi Liquid Fund to be modified accordingly
- Updated SID and KIM documents to reflect the change
- Investors to be notified of the revised terms

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: To be announced in 2025
- Notification issued: August 21, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This change provides greater flexibility to investors by reducing the minimum commitment period for STP from 12 months to 6 months. The modification is limited to one specific mutual fund scheme and has minimal broader market impact, primarily benefiting existing and potential investors in Unifi Liquid Fund by lowering entry barriers for systematic transfer plans.
