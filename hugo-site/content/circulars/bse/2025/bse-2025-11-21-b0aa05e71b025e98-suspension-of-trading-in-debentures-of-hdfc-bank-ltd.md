## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to Medium. The suspension affects only a specific series of HDFC Bank's non-convertible debentures. While HDFC Bank is a major financial institution, this is a routine corporate action affecting debt securities rather than equity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure systems are updated to prevent trading in the affected ISIN from November 28, 2025. Debenture holders will receive their final redemption proceeds and interest payment as scheduled.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these debentures will need to have them in demat form by the record date to receive redemption proceeds. No action required for existing holders, but new purchases are not possible from the suspension date.
