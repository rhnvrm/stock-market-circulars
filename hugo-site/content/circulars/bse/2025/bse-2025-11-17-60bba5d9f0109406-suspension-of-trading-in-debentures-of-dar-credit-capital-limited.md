title: Suspension of Trading in Debentures of DAR CREDIT & CAPITAL LIMITED
---

## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in two series of Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) issued by DAR CREDIT & CAPITAL LIMITED effective November 25, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for early redemption of these debentures. Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Two NCD series of DAR CREDIT & CAPITAL LIMITED will be suspended from trading
- ISIN INE04Q907066 (Code: 960472) - DCCL-12.25%-10-2-26-PVT
- ISIN INE04Q907082 (Code: 960473) - DCCL-NIFTY-10-2-26-PVT
- Suspension reason: Early redemption of NCDs
- Record date and no dealings date coincide on November 25, 2025
- Notice reference: DR-763/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard suspension procedure for debentures undergoing early redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from November 25, 2025
- Trading members must inform their clients holding these securities about the suspension and early redemption
- No dealings permitted in both NCD series from the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **November 17, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **November 25, 2025**: Record date for early redemption
- **November 25, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date (no dealings from this date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of these specific NCD series. The suspension prevents any secondary market transactions, ensuring all holders as of the record date are eligible for early redemption.

**Investor Impact**: Medium - Investors holding these debentures will receive early redemption proceeds but lose the ability to trade these securities from November 25, 2025. This affects liquidity but provides early exit for debenture holders.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trades in these two ISIN codes and communicate the suspension to affected clients within the short notice period (8 days).
