## Summary

BSE has issued comprehensive procedural guidelines for members to report cyber incidents through the BEFS (BSE Electronic Filing System) portal. The circular outlines two types of reporting: Quarterly Incident Reporting to be submitted within 15 days after quarter-end, and Immediate Incident Reporting to be submitted within 6 hours of any cyber-attack, threat, or breach. Members must use designated Excel templates and submit digitally signed PDF reports through their Designated Officers.

## Key Points

- Two types of cyber incident reporting required: Quarterly and Immediate
- Quarterly reports must be submitted within 15 days after the end of each quarter
- Immediate incidents must be reported within 6 hours of receipt of information
- All submissions must be made through BEFS portal at https://befs.bseindia.com/Login.aspx
- Microsoft Excel version 2007 or above required for CIR templates
- Templates must have macros enabled and data validated before submission
- Final reports must be digitally signed by Designated Officer
- System-generated acknowledgement email confirms successful submission

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular provides detailed procedural guidance for existing cyber incident reporting requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Designated Officer Responsibilities**: Must submit quarterly reports within 15 days after quarter-end and immediate reports within 6 hours of cyber incidents
- **Template Download**: Download CIR templates from BEFS portal for respective year and quarter
- **Data Entry**: Complete all required fields in Excel template, enable macros, and validate all sheets
- **Report Types**: Indicate whether cyber-attacks/breaches were observed (Yes/No) and provide detailed information if applicable
- **Digital Signature**: PDF reports must be digitally signed by Designated Officer before final submission
- **Acknowledgement**: Retain system-generated acknowledgement email as proof of submission
- **Email Notifications**: Compliance Officer and Designated Officer will receive confirmation emails

## Important Dates

- **Quarter Ending**: December 31, 2025
- **Quarterly Report Deadline**: Within 15 days after end of respective quarter
- **Immediate Incident Deadline**: Within 6 hours of receipt of cyber incident information

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Members must ensure their Designated Officers are trained on the BEFS portal procedures and maintain readiness for both quarterly and immediate incident reporting. The requirement for digital signatures and strict timelines (6 hours for immediate incidents, 15 days for quarterly reports) necessitates robust internal processes.

**Compliance Impact**: All BSE trading members are required to comply with these reporting procedures. Non-compliance or delayed reporting could result in regulatory action. Members must have appropriate cyber incident detection and escalation mechanisms in place to meet the 6-hour reporting requirement for immediate incidents.
