- **Reference Notice**: 20250225-30 dated February 25, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The trading suspension affects holders of two specific debt securities of Piramal Finance Limited. The upward revision in coupon rates (increase of 25 basis points for INE516Y07014 and 25 basis points for INE516Y07063) is favorable for debt holders as they will receive higher interest payments. However, trading will be temporarily suspended starting December 02, 2025 to facilitate the restructuring process. Market participants holding or trading these specific ISINs need to plan accordingly for the suspension period.
