## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine NFO launch for a new small cap equity fund scheme. It provides investment opportunities for mutual fund investors but does not affect broader market operations or trading activities.

**Operational Impact**: Low to moderate for BSE StAR MF Platform members who need to process NFO transactions. Members must ensure compliance with fund initiation deadlines and manage client transactions according to specified timelines.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for investors seeking small cap equity exposure through HELIOS MUTUAL FUND. Multiple plan options (Regular/Direct) and variants (Growth/IDCW) provide flexibility for different investor preferences.
