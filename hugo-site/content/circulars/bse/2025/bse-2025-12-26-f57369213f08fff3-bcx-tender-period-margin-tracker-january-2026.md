## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects liquidity and trading activity in commodity derivatives during tender period as higher margins may reduce speculative positions.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and clients with open positions in these commodity futures must plan for increased margin requirements. The progressive increase helps manage delivery risk and ensures adequate collateral as contracts approach physical delivery.

**Risk Management:** The escalating margin structure reduces settlement risk and ensures participants are adequately capitalized for potential delivery obligations. The 25% minimum delivery margin on expiry date provides substantial buffer for final settlement.
