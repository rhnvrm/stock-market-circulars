## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions represent enhanced surveillance measures to control excessive volatility and protect investor interests. Lower price bands (2%-5%) indicate tighter restrictions on daily price movements, while higher bands (10%-20%) allow greater intraday fluctuation.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect revised price bands before market opening on December 17, 2025
- All orders must comply with new price band limits from the effective date
- Members should communicate these changes to clients trading in affected securities
- Any clarifications should be sought from bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 16, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 17, 2025 (from market opening)

## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will restrict intraday price movements for these securities, potentially reducing trading volumes and volatility. Securities with 2% price bands face the strictest limits, which may impact liquidity. Traders and investors in these scrips should adjust their strategies accordingly. The measure aims to prevent speculative trading and ensure orderly market conditions in these securities.
