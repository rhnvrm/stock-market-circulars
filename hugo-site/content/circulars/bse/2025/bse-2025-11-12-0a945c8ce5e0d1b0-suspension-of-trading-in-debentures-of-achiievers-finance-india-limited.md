---

## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in debentures of ACHIIEVERS FINANCE INDIA LIMITED (Scrip Code: 960412, ISIN: INE065507316) effective November 18, 2025. The suspension is imposed because the company has fixed November 18, 2025 as the record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest on AFIL-11.75%-1-12-25 series.

## Key Points

- Trading Members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures from November 18, 2025
- The affected debenture series is AFIL-11.75%-1-12-25 with ISIN INE065507316
- Scrip code: 960412
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Notice issued under DR-758/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard operational measure implemented when a company sets a record date for debenture redemption and interest payment to ensure proper settlement.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must cease all dealing in the specified debentures of ACHIIEVERS FINANCE INDIA LIMITED from November 18, 2025
- Trading Members must note the record date and suspension details for client communications
- No new trades should be executed in the affected debenture series

## Important Dates

- **November 12, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 18, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **November 18, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date (no dealings from this date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders and potential traders of ACHIIEVERS FINANCE INDIA LIMITED debentures. The suspension prevents trading to establish clear ownership for redemption proceeds and interest payments.

**Operational Impact**: Trading Members must update their systems to block trades in scrip code 960412. Debenture holders will receive their redemption proceeds and interest payment based on holdings as of the record date.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these debentures cannot exit their positions after the suspension date. However, this is expected as the debentures are being redeemed, and investors will receive principal plus accrued interest.
