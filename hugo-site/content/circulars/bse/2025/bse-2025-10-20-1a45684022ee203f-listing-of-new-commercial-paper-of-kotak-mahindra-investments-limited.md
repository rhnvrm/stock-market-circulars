The high credit ratings (A1+ from both CRISIL and ICRA) indicate strong creditworthiness and low default risk. The discount-based pricing (issue price of Rs. 4,70,723.50 against face value of Rs. 5,00,000) implies an effective yield of approximately 6.22% annualized. This listing provides institutional investors with an additional money market instrument option from a highly-rated financial services entity.
