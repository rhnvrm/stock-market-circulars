title: Suspension of Trading in Debentures of Ahmedabad Ring Road Infrastructure Ltd
---

## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in debentures of Ahmedabad Ring Road Infrastructure Ltd (ARRIL) effective October 30, 2025, following the company's notification of early full redemption. The affected security is the ARRIL 20% NCD originally scheduled to mature on June 30, 2026 (ISIN: INE091I07011, Scrip Code: 975947). Trading members are advised to cease dealing in these debentures immediately.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension effective from October 30, 2025
- Reason: Early full redemption of non-convertible debentures
- Affected security: ARRIL-20%-30-6-26-PVT (20% coupon rate debenture)
- ISIN: INE091I07011
- Scrip Code: 975947
- Reference: DR-746/2025-2026
- Notice issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President â€“ Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard suspension procedure following early redemption notification from the issuer.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the specified debentures from October 30, 2025 onwards
- Trading members are required to take note of this suspension and update their systems accordingly
- No new trades should be executed in the affected ISIN

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 29, 2025
- **Suspension Effective Date**: October 30, 2025
- **Original Maturity Date**: June 30, 2026 (now subject to early redemption)

## Impact Assessment

The suspension affects holders and potential traders of ARRIL's 20% debentures. Early redemption benefits debenture holders who will receive principal repayment ahead of the original June 2026 maturity. The impact is localized to this specific debt security and does not affect other market segments. Trading members must ensure compliance to avoid dealing in suspended securities. The early redemption indicates the issuer's financial capacity to prepay debt obligations.
