## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 107 securities with varying liquidity profiles. Large-cap stocks listed have minimal quantities suggesting limited market impact, while some mid/small-cap stocks have substantial quantities that could experience price volatility during auction.

**Operational Impact:** Participants with delivery shortfalls in these scrips must participate in the auction mechanism, potentially at prices different from market rates. The auction ensures settlement integrity and penalty enforcement for delivery failures.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders of affected companies may see temporary price movements during auction execution. The relatively small quantities for most blue-chip stocks suggest minimal impact on overall market capitalization.
