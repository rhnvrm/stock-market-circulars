## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing announcement with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment represents capital raising through warrant conversion. The lock-in periods (until June 2026 and June 2027 for different tranches) will restrict immediate liquidity of these shares. The total new shares represent a relatively small issuance for a listed company, and the lock-in provisions ensure gradual entry into the tradable float. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and be aware of the lock-in restrictions when processing trades.
