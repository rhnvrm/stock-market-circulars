## Summary

Tilak Ventures Limited (Scrip Code: 503663) has announced a rights issue of equity shares with a record date of December 15, 2025. The company is offering 2 new equity shares of Re.1/- each at par for every 1 existing equity share held. Trading in the company's shares will be conducted on an ex-rights basis effective December 15, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-777/2025-2026).

## Key Points

- Rights ratio: 2 new equity shares for every 1 existing share held
- Face value: Re.1/- per share
- Issue price: Re.1/- per share (at par)
- Payment terms: Full issue price payable on application
- Security type: Dematerialised securities in rolling settlement segment
- Notice number: 20251210-11

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action notification in compliance with exchange listing requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure all transactions in Tilak Ventures Limited shares are conducted on ex-rights basis from December 15, 2025
- Settlement number DR-777/2025-2026 must be used for transactions from the ex-rights date
- Members must take note of the rights entitlement ratio when processing client orders and entitlements

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: December 15, 2025 - Shareholders on this date will be eligible for rights entitlement
- **Ex-Rights Date**: December 15, 2025 - Trading begins on ex-rights basis
- **Settlement Number**: DR-777/2025-2026
- **Circular Date**: December 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High dilution potential as the rights issue offers 2 shares for every 1 held, potentially tripling the outstanding share capital if fully subscribed. Shareholders who do not participate will face significant dilution of their ownership percentage.

**Price Impact**: The share price will be adjusted to trade ex-rights from December 15, 2025. The theoretical ex-rights price will reflect the dilution from the 2:1 rights offer at par value.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders must decide whether to subscribe to maintain their proportional ownership. The at-par pricing (Re.1/-) suggests the rights issue is fairly priced at face value. Non-participating shareholders will see their ownership diluted by approximately 66.67%.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and inform clients about rights entitlements, subscription procedures, and the ex-rights trading adjustment.
