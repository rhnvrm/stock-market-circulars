## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal to none. This is a case-specific appellate order relating to past conduct in Golden Tobacco Limited.

**Entity Impact:** Provides temporary relief to Ashok Kumar Joshi by staying the debarment order, allowing continued participation in securities market operations pending final appeal resolution. However, partial penalty payment required.

**Precedent Value:** The order highlights SAT's consideration of procedural delays in enforcement proceedings, particularly the 5-year gap between resignation and show cause notice issuance, as a factor meriting interim relief.

**Compliance Significance:** Market participants facing similar enforcement actions may note SAT's willingness to grant interim stays on debarment where significant procedural delays exist, subject to partial penalty deposit as security.
