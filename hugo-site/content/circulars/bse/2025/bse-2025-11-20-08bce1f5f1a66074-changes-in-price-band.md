title: Changes in Price Band for Six Securities

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for six securities effective November 21, 2025. The changes include tightening or widening of circuit limits that restrict daily price movements. The revisions affect AIK Pipes and Polymers Ltd (10%), Asarfi Hospital Ltd (5%), Piramal Finance Ltd (20%), Securekloud Technologies Ltd (10%), Synthiko Foils Ltd (2%), and True Colors Ltd (5%).

## Key Points

- Six scrips will have revised price bands from November 21, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive)
- Piramal Finance Ltd has the widest band at 20%
- Synthiko Foils Ltd has the tightest band at 2%
- Changes implemented by BSE Surveillance Department
- Trading members can seek clarification at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This is an operational adjustment of existing price band mechanisms under BSE surveillance measures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure their systems reflect the new price bands from November 21, 2025
- Orders exceeding the revised price bands will be rejected by the trading system
- Members should inform clients trading in these scrips about the revised circuit limits

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 20, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 21, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The varying price bands indicate different levels of surveillance concern for each security. Tighter bands (2-5%) suggest higher volatility concerns or surveillance measures, while wider bands (20%) indicate normal trading parameters. Traders in these securities will face different daily price movement limits, potentially affecting liquidity and trading strategies. The 2% band on Synthiko Foils is particularly restrictive and may signal enhanced surveillance measures.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems and risk management frameworks must be updated to reflect new circuit limits. Day traders and algorithmic systems need to adjust for the new price movement constraints.
