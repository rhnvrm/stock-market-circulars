## Summary

BSE has announced updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective December 31, 2025. Three securities have been newly shortlisted under LT-ASM, and two existing securities will be moved to higher ASM stages. No securities are being moved to lower stages or exiting the framework.

## Key Points

- 3 new securities shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: ANS Industries Ltd, K&R Rail Engineering Ltd, and Prakash Steelage Ltd
- 2 securities moved to higher Stage II ASM: Refex Renewables & Infrastructure Ltd and U. H. Zaveri Ltd
- No securities moved to lower ASM stages
- No securities moving out of Long Term ASM Framework
- No securities placed directly in Stage IV under Direct stage IV LT-ASM Framework
- Consolidated list includes 14+ securities under various ASM stages (ranging from Stage I to Stage IV)

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework continues to monitor securities exhibiting unusual price movements or excessive volatility over extended periods. Securities under this framework face additional trading restrictions including:

- Enhanced margin requirements
- Trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday squaring off)
- Price bands and other surveillance measures
- Progressive escalation through ASM stages (I through IV) based on continued anomalous behavior

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with enhanced surveillance measures for affected securities
- Investors should be aware of trade-for-trade settlement requirements
- Higher margin requirements apply for positions in LT-ASM securities
- No delivery-based short selling permitted in these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 31, 2025 - All LT-ASM changes become applicable

## Securities Affected

### Part A - Newly Shortlisted (Stage I):
1. ANS Industries Ltd (531406, INE234J01018)
2. K&R Rail Engineering Ltd (514360, INE078T01026)
3. Prakash Steelage Ltd (533239, INE696K01024)

### Part B - Moved to Higher Stage II:
1. Refex Renewables & Infrastructure Ltd (531260, INE332F01018)
2. U. H. Zaveri Ltd (541338, INE556Z01010)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The inclusion of securities in LT-ASM typically results in reduced liquidity and increased trading costs due to trade-for-trade settlement and higher margins. This affects both retail and institutional investors holding or trading these securities.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in the 5 affected securities will face stricter trading conditions. The two securities moving to Stage II will see further tightening of surveillance measures, potentially leading to reduced trading volumes and higher volatility.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members must update their systems to enforce additional margin requirements and settlement restrictions for these securities from December 31, 2025.
