## Impact Assessment

This listing represents a significant corporate restructuring under insolvency proceedings. The complete elimination of promoter holdings and substantial reduction in public shareholding (from 7.49 crore to 4.43 lakh shares) indicates major capital reorganization. The restriction to XT group and trade-to-trade segment suggests higher risk classification and surveillance measures. The lock-in of 95% of total shares until December 2026 will significantly limit liquidity. Investors should exercise caution given the insolvency background and trading restrictions.
