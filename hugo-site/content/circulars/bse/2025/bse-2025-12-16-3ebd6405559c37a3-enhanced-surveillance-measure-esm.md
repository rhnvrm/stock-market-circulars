## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects trading in 8 securities with stage changes or new additions

**Operational Impact**: 
- Increased scrutiny on 3 newly added securities (Amkay Products, Space Incubatrics Technologies, TV Vision)
- Enhanced restrictions on 5 securities moving to higher ESM stages
- Traders and investors in these securities will face additional surveillance and potential trading limitations

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of enhanced monitoring and potential liquidity constraints associated with ESM classification.
