## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or planning to transact in international mutual fund schemes need to plan their transactions around these non-business days. Purchase and redemption requests cannot be placed on these dates.

**Market Impact**: Limited market impact as this is routine operational practice aligned with foreign market holidays. Affects only specific international fund categories.

**Operational Impact**: AMCs and distributors must ensure proper communication to investors and update their systems to block transactions on specified dates for affected schemes.
