## Summary

BSE has published the demat auction settlement schedule No. 787 dated December 31, 2025, listing 154 securities across various scrips that will be auctioned due to delivery shortages. The auction includes major blue-chip stocks like Reliance Industries (2,150 shares), Siemens (2,250 shares), and TCS (757 shares), as well as large quantities of mid and small-cap stocks like Suzlon Energy (72,000 shares), Rama Steel Tubes (268,000 shares), and Vodafone Idea (33,030 shares).

## Key Points

- Settlement Number: 787
- Settlement Date: December 31, 2025
- Total securities listed: 154 scrips
- Includes major blue-chip companies: Reliance Industries, TCS, Siemens, Wipro, NTPC, State Bank of India
- Large volume auctions include: Suzlon Energy (72,000 shares), Rama Steel Tubes (268,000 shares), Vodafone Idea (33,030 shares), Wardwizard Innovations (10,906 shares)
- Mid-cap stocks affected: JSW Energy (13,794 shares), NMDC (12,000 shares), Federal Bank (10,000 shares), Indus Towers (10,200 shares)
- Auction triggered due to non-delivery by selling brokers in regular settlement

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard operational auction settlement process.

## Compliance Requirements

- Buying brokers whose clients did not receive securities must participate in the auction to procure shares
- Selling brokers who failed to deliver will bear the auction price differential and penalties
- All auction participants must comply with BSE auction settlement procedures
- Settlement obligations must be fulfilled as per exchange regulations

## Important Dates

- **Settlement Date**: December 31, 2025
- **Settlement Number**: 787
- Auction execution date: To be announced by BSE (typically within 2-3 trading days of settlement)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - While the auction includes major stocks, the quantities are relatively small compared to daily trading volumes for large-cap stocks. However, significant volumes in some mid and small-cap stocks (Suzlon: 72,000 shares, Rama Steel: 268,000 shares) may cause temporary price volatility.

**Operational Impact**: Affects brokers and clearing members who failed to deliver securities in the regular settlement. They will need to arrange funds for auction purchases and bear price differences.

**Investor Impact**: Limited direct impact on retail investors. Primarily affects institutional and broker settlement processes. Stocks under auction may experience temporary price pressure during auction execution.
