## Summary

BSE has issued a notice regarding the rescission of delisting for Typhoon Holdings Ltd (Scrip Code: 512307) following an order from the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal. The company's status will be changed from "Delisted" to "Suspended" effective December 17, 2025. As a result of this status change, the provisions of Regulation 24(1) and Regulation 24(2) of SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 will no longer be applicable to the company.

## Key Points

- Delisting of Typhoon Holdings Ltd (Scrip Code: 512307) has been rescinded pursuant to Securities Appellate Tribunal order
- Company status will change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"
- SEBI Delisting Regulations provisions (Regulation 24(1) and 24(2)) are no longer applicable
- Notice issued by Deputy Vice President and Manager of Listing Compliance

## Regulatory Changes

The Securities Appellate Tribunal has issued an order that reverses the previous delisting status of Typhoon Holdings Ltd. This regulatory intervention overturns the delisting decision and reinstates the company under suspended status. The provisions of Regulation 24(1) and Regulation 24(2) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009, which typically govern delisting procedures, are now inapplicable to this company.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements are outlined in this circular. The notice is informational, notifying market participants of the change in company status resulting from the tribunal order. Typhoon Holdings Ltd will need to comply with requirements applicable to suspended securities rather than delisted securities.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 15, 2025
- **Effective Date of Status Change**: December 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact is primarily limited to Typhoon Holdings Ltd and its shareholders. The rescission of delisting provides a potential pathway for the company to address issues that led to suspension and eventually resume trading. For the broader market, this is a procedural update with minimal impact. Shareholders of Typhoon Holdings Ltd may benefit from the change as it reopens possibilities for future relisting if the company meets regulatory requirements. The Securities Appellate Tribunal's intervention demonstrates the appeal mechanism available for delisting decisions.
