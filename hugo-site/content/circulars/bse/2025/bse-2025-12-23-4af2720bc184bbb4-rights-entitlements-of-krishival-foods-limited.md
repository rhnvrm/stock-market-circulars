## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular follows existing procedures for Rights Entitlements trading as per previous notices dated March 5, 2020 (notice no-20200305-21) and May 18, 2020 (notice no-20200518-34).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must inform all clients about commencement of trading in REs, mentioning the ISIN (INE0GGO20015)
- Trading Members must clarify that REs are not ordinary shares of the company
- Contract notes/bills for purchase of REs must include a prominent disclaimer stating:
  - Purchase of REs only gives right to participate in ongoing rights issue by making application with requisite money OR renounce REs before issue closes
  - REs which are neither subscribed nor renounced on or before Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished
- Trading Members must refer to previous notices for additional details

## Important Dates

- **December 26, 2025**: Rights Entitlements trading begins; Rights Issue opens
- **December 31, 2025**: Last day for Rights Entitlements renunciation trading
- **January 5, 2026**: Rights Issue closes; deadline for subscription or renunciation

## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium impact on KRISHIVAL FOODS LIMITED shareholders who wish to trade their rights entitlements. The 6-day renunciation trading window (December 26-31, 2025) provides limited time for shareholders to decide whether to subscribe, renounce, or trade their rights. Trading Members must ensure proper client communication and disclaimer inclusion to prevent confusion between REs and ordinary shares. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis requires careful attention to settlement timelines. Un-renounced rights will lapse, potentially diluting existing shareholders who fail to act within the specified timeframe.
