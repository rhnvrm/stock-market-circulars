title: Removal of Restriction on Subscription in Certain Schemes of Aditya Birla Sun
  Life Mutual Fund
---

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited has announced the removal of the maximum subscription limit restriction of Rs. 10 crores per PAN per investor across all transactions for two specific schemes. This change takes effect from Monday, December 8, 2025, and applies to Aditya Birla Sun Life Medium Term Plan and Aditya Birla Sun Life Credit Risk Fund. The removal allows investors to subscribe above the previous cap without restrictions.

## Key Points

- Maximum subscription limit of Rs. 10 crores per PAN per investor is being removed
- Applies to Aditya Birla Sun Life Medium Term Plan
- Applies to Aditya Birla Sun Life Credit Risk Fund
- Restriction removal across all transaction types
- All other scheme features and terms remain unchanged
- This addendum (No. 53/2025) forms integral part of SID and KIM

## Regulatory Changes

The Investment Manager has removed the investment cap that previously limited individual investors to a maximum subscription of Rs. 10 crores per PAN across all transactions in the specified schemes. This regulatory change enables unlimited subscription amounts for investors meeting scheme eligibility criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

Investors and distributors should:
- Note that the Rs. 10 crore per PAN subscription limit no longer applies to these two schemes
- Update internal systems and processes to reflect unlimited subscription capability
- Continue to follow all other terms and conditions as outlined in the SID and KIM
- Read all scheme related documents carefully before investing

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 4, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 8, 2025 (Monday)

## Impact Assessment

This change has medium positive impact for high-net-worth investors and institutional investors who were previously constrained by the Rs. 10 crore cap. The removal of subscription limits in the Medium Term Plan and Credit Risk Fund may attract larger ticket sizes and increase AUM for these schemes. However, the overall market impact remains limited as this affects only two specific mutual fund schemes and does not impact equity market operations or broader trading activities.
