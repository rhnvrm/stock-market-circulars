- This notice references previous communications dated September 23, 2025 (Notice No. 20250923-24 & 20250923-25)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational update regarding the availability of mutual fund schemes on the BSE StAR MF trading platform.

## Compliance Requirements

Members should note the availability of these schemes for processing ongoing transactions starting October 17, 2025. No specific compliance actions required beyond normal mutual fund transaction processing procedures.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 16, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 17, 2025 - Schemes become available for ongoing transactions

## Impact Assessment

This is a low-impact operational notice affecting only investors and distributors interested in THE WEALTH COMPANY MUTUAL FUND schemes. The reopening provides investors access to four schemes across equity and liquid categories, enabling diversification options. Market-wide impact is minimal as this pertains to a single fund house's scheme availability on the platform.
