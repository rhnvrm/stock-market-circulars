## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Addition of 12.5+ million shares to BSE trading platform increases market float for Mother Nutri Foods Limited.

**Trading Impact:** Significant portion of shares under lock-in (promoter holdings) will restrict immediate tradeable float, potentially affecting liquidity in early trading days.

**Investor Impact:** Anchor investors have short-term lock-in (1-3 months), while promoters face extended lock-in periods of 1-3 years, providing stability signal to market participants.
