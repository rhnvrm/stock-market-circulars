## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects SLB participants with open positions in these two securities. The short shut periods minimize market disruption.

**Operational Impact**: SLB participants must actively monitor and close positions in advance. Failure to close positions by foreclosure dates may result in penalties or forced closeout. The rights issue entitlement determination requires clean shareholding records, necessitating the temporary suspension of SLB activities in these securities.

**Liquidity Impact**: Temporary reduction in lending/borrowing liquidity for these specific securities during shut periods. Participants seeking to short or leverage these stocks must plan alternative strategies during the affected dates.
