## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of over 131 million shares represents significant equity dilution. However, immediate trading impact is limited as all shares are locked-in until end of 2027. The preferential allotment to promoters may indicate capital raising efforts or debt restructuring initiatives.

**Shareholding Impact**: The promoter shareholding will increase substantially given the preferential nature of the allotment. The conversion from warrants suggests previously planned capital infusion is now materialized.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact on free float as shares remain locked for approximately 2 years. Post lock-in expiry, significant supply may enter the market affecting share price dynamics.

**Investor Consideration**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution impact on earnings per share and voting rights. The issue price of Rs. 29.84 will serve as a reference point for valuation assessment.
