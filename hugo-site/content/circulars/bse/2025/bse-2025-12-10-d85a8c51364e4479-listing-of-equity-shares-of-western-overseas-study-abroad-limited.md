## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to a single company in the education services sector. The staggered lock-in structure suggests a typical post-IPO or promoter shareholding arrangement. Approximately 30% of the total listed shares (17,98,000 out of 60,12,000) are immediately available for trading, while the remaining 70% will gradually unlock over the next three years. This phased unlock mechanism helps prevent sudden supply shocks in the stock price.
