## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt security listing with minimal market impact. The securities are issued by a private limited company on a private placement basis, targeting institutional or qualified investors. The CARE A- (Stable) rating indicates adequate credit quality. The monthly interest payment structure and relatively short tenure (approximately 2 years) make these suitable for investors seeking regular income with moderate credit risk. Market-wide impact is negligible as this affects only participants in the debt segment interested in private placement securities.
