## Impact Assessment

This change provides investors with an additional option to receive income distributions along with capital withdrawal from the Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund. The IDCW option is particularly relevant for investors seeking periodic income from their mutual fund investments rather than pure capital appreciation.

**Investor Impact**: Existing investors can choose to switch to the IDCW option if they prefer income distribution, while new investors will have the choice between growth and IDCW options. The underlying investment strategy and asset allocation remain unchanged.

**Market Impact**: Minimal direct market impact as this is an operational change specific to one mutual fund scheme. However, it may attract a different investor segment interested in dividend/income distribution options.

**Fund Operations**: The fund management company will need to track and process dividend distributions for IDCW option holders while maintaining the same portfolio management strategy across all options.
