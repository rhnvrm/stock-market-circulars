## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Existing Shareholders**: The resolution plan significantly dilutes public shareholding from existing levels to just 10% of total capital, with massive dilution through the 90% allocation to the SRA. The capital reduction from Rs. 10 to Rs. 1 per share represents a 90% reduction in face value, impacting book value calculations.

**Trading Restrictions**: Continuation in T Group and Trade-to-Trade segment severely restricts liquidity, preventing intraday trading and requiring full delivery of shares. This limits trading flexibility and may impact price discovery.

**Corporate Restructuring**: The insolvency resolution represents a complete change in control and business direction. Public shareholders face significant ownership dilution and uncertainty regarding future business operations under new management.

**Regulatory Oversight**: Special pre-open session requirements and restrictive trading segments indicate enhanced surveillance, reflecting the company's distressed history and need for investor protection measures.
