## Summary

BSE has announced the listing of further securities issued by 16 companies under their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). These newly issued shares will be listed and admitted for trading on the Exchange with effect from Friday, December 5, 2025. The circular covers major companies including ICICI Bank, Wipro, Federal Bank, L&T Finance, and others. None of the listed shares are under lock-in period.

## Key Points

- 16 companies are listing additional equity shares issued under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Total new shares being listed: approximately 4.38 million shares across all companies
- Effective trading date: December 5, 2025
- No lock-in period applicable for any of the listed securities

- Face values range from Re 1 to Rs 10 depending on the company
- All companies have designated ISIN and scrip codes for trading

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for securities already approved under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to update their systems for the new securities
- Companies must ensure proper disclosure and transparency regarding the ESOP/ESOS issuances
- Standard listing compliance requirements apply as per BSE regulations
- No special compliance obligations due to absence of lock-in restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 4, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: December 5, 2025
- **Lock-in Period**: Not Applicable (NA) for all companies

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine corporate action with negligible impact on stock prices or market liquidity.

**Dilution Impact**: Very low. The number of new shares represents a small percentage of the existing share capital for most companies. For example, ICICI Bank's 714,457 new shares are minimal compared to its large float.

**Liquidity Impact**: Neutral to slightly positive. Additional shares in circulation may marginally improve liquidity, though the quantum is too small to materially affect trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: No immediate action required by investors. The ESOP/ESOS shares are immediately tradeable without lock-in restrictions, allowing employee shareholders to participate in the market if they choose.

**Company-Specific Considerations**: Companies like Jyoti Structures, L&T Finance, and IIFL Capital Services have relatively larger issuances, but still within normal ESOP grant parameters.
