## Summary

BSE has extended the timelines for submission of System Audit reports (Type-III) for trading members who use algorithmic trading or provide algorithmic trading facilities to clients. This extension applies to the half-yearly audit period from April 2025 to September 2025 and was granted following representations from market participants in consultation with SEBI.

## Key Points

- Extension applies to stockbrokers using algorithmic trading or providing algorithmic trading facilities
- Covers half-yearly audit period: April 2025 - September 2025
- Extension granted after consultation between Exchanges and SEBI
- Applies to all eligible members including Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs)
- Three separate deadlines extended: Audit Plan submission, Preliminary Audit Report, and Action Taken Report

## Regulatory Changes

This circular modifies the timelines originally specified in Exchange notice no. 20251017-29 dated October 17, 2025. The extension does not change the fundamental requirement for system audits but provides additional time for compliance.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members using algorithmic trading must:

1. **Complete System Auditor Appointment & Submit Audit Plan** - by December 10, 2025
2. **Submit Preliminary Audit Report** - by December 31, 2025
3. **Submit Action Taken Report (ATR)** - by March 31, 2026 (if applicable)

These requirements apply to the half-yearly period from April 2025 to September 2025.

## Important Dates

- **December 10, 2025**: Deadline for completion of System Auditor Appointment and submission of Audit Plan
- **December 31, 2025**: Deadline for submission of Preliminary Audit Report
- **March 31, 2026**: Deadline for submission of Action Taken Report (if applicable)
- **Audit Period Covered**: April 2025 - September 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Affected Entities**: Trading members who use algorithmic trading or provide algorithmic trading facilities to clients, including Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs).

**Operational Impact**: Medium - The extension provides relief to trading members by allowing additional time to complete system audits and submit required reports. This reduces immediate compliance pressure while maintaining audit requirements.

**Market Impact**: Low - This is an administrative extension that does not affect trading operations or market structure. It demonstrates regulatory flexibility in response to industry feedback while maintaining oversight of algorithmic trading systems.
