## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational circular for debt segment participants. The non-competitive bidding facility allows trading members and investors to participate in G-sec auctions without competing on yield. The auction provides liquidity in the government securities market but has minimal impact on equity markets or general trading operations. Only members dealing in debt securities need to take action.
