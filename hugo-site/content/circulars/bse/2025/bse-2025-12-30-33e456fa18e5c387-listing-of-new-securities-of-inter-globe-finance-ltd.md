This is a routine listing notification for a single company's preferential allotment. The impact is limited to Inter Globe Finance Ltd. shareholders and does not affect broader market operations. The lock-in provisions ensure these shares cannot be freely traded until specified dates, minimizing immediate dilution impact. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and lock-in details.
