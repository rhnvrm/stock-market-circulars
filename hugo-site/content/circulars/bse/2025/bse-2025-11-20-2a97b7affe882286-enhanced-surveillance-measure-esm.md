## Securities Moving to Higher ESM Stage

- **Synthiko Foils Ltd** (Scrip Code: 513307, ISIN: INE363L01045) - Moving to higher ESM stage

## Regulatory Changes

Securities under ESM framework are subject to:
- Additional surveillance due to abnormal price movements or trading patterns
- Staged restrictions based on severity (Stage I or Stage II)
- Potential trade-for-trade settlement
- Enhanced monitoring by the exchange

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note the ESM classification of these securities
- Investors trading in these securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance status
- Brokers must ensure appropriate risk disclosures to clients trading these securities
- Additional margin requirements may apply

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 21, 2025
- All changes to ESM classification take effect from this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 6 securities to ESM indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny on these stocks due to unusual price or volume patterns. This typically results in reduced liquidity and increased trading costs.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should exercise increased caution. ESM classification often leads to:
- Reduced trading volumes
- Wider bid-ask spreads
- Potential migration to trade-for-trade segment
- Higher margin requirements

**Operational Impact**: The movement of Synthiko Foils Ltd to a higher ESM stage suggests continued concerns about the security's trading pattern, warranting additional caution from market participants.
