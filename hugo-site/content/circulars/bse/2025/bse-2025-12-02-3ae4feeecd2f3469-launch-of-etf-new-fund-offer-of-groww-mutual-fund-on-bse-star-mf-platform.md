## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it is a routine NFO announcement. It provides members and investors an opportunity to participate in a new metal sector ETF offering. The impact is limited to:

- **Operational**: Members need to coordinate payment processing and fund clearance within specified timelines
- **Investor Access**: New investment option for exposure to Nifty Metal index through ETF structure
- **Market Participation**: Standard NFO process with no disruption to existing trading or settlement activities

The extended trading hours until midnight on the last day provides additional flexibility for lumpsum subscriptions.
