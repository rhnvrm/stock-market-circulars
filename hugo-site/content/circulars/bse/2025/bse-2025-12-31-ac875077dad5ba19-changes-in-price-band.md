## Summary

BSE has announced revised price bands for eight securities effective from January 1, 2026. The revised bands range from 2% to 20%, with three scrips moved to 2% band, three to 5% band, one to 10% band, and one to 20% band. This surveillance measure is designed to control volatility in these securities.

## Key Points

- Getalong Enterprise Ltd (543372) - revised to 5% band

- Soma Textiles & Industries Ltd (521034) - revised to 2% band
- Unisem Agritech Ltd (544648) - revised to 20% band
- Notice issued by BSE Surveillance Department

## Regulatory Changes

Price bands have been revised from their existing levels for the mentioned scrips. Price bands restrict the maximum price movement (both upward and downward) that a security can experience during a trading session. Tighter bands (2-5%) indicate higher surveillance, while wider bands (10-20%) allow greater price movement.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised price bands for these scrips
- All trades in these securities must comply with the new price band limits from January 1, 2026
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 31, 2025
- **Effective Date**: January 1, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The revised price bands will impact intraday trading strategies for these securities. Scrips with narrower bands (2%) will experience limited price movement, potentially affecting liquidity and trading volumes. The 20% band for Unisem Agritech suggests higher volatility expectations. Trading members need to adjust their risk management systems and inform clients about the restricted price movements in these securities.
