## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine listing notice for preferential allotment. The shares were allotted to non-promoters through warrant conversion, representing capital infusion at Rs. 17.50 per share.

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal immediate impact as all 26,39,000 shares are locked-in until May 30, 2026, preventing trading until lock-in expiry.

**Dilution Impact:** The addition of 26,39,000 equity shares will dilute existing shareholding. The exact dilution percentage would depend on the pre-issue share capital of the company.

**Investor Considerations:** The lock-in period indicates these shares were issued to strategic or identified investors as part of a preferential allotment, with restrictions on transferability for approximately 6 months from the listing date.
