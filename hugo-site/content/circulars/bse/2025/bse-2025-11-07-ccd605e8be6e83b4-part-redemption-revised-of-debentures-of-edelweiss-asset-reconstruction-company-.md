## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This affects only holders of specific privately placed debentures of Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company Limited.

**Debenture Holders**: The part redemption reduces the outstanding face value to Rs. 1000 per debenture. Debenture holders will receive partial redemption proceeds based on the reduction from the original face value.

**Trading Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the revised face value post-redemption for accurate pricing and settlement of these debentures in the debt segment.
