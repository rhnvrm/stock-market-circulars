- Restrictions on derivatives trading
- Enhanced monitoring and disclosure requirements

The stage of ESM determines the intensity of surveillance measures applied.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure 100% upfront margin collection for ESM securities
- All trades in ESM securities will be settled on a Trade-for-Trade basis
- No intraday trading or netting of positions allowed
- Clients must have adequate funds/securities before order placement
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in ESM securities

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** December 2, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 3, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 7 securities to ESM and upward stage movement of 3 securities will impact:
- **Liquidity:** Reduced trading activity due to T2T settlement and margin requirements
- **Investor Participation:** Retail and institutional investors may reduce exposure
- **Price Discovery:** Trading restrictions may affect price formation
- **Market Integrity:** Enhanced surveillance aims to curb excessive speculation and protect investors
- **Trading Members:** Need to update systems and ensure compliance with ESM requirements
