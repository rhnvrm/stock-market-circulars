## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This is a routine surveillance measure where BSE adjusts price bands based on factors such as stock volatility, trading patterns, and risk assessment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new price bands
- Orders exceeding the revised price band limits will be rejected
- Members should inform their clients about the revised trading limits
- Clarifications can be requested at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 3, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 4, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The revised price bands will directly affect the maximum intraday price movement allowed for these 16 securities. Stocks with tighter bands (2%-5%) will have more restricted price movements, while those with 20% bands will have greater flexibility.

**Market Participants**: Traders and investors in these securities need to adjust their strategies, particularly for intraday trading and stop-loss orders. The strictest band of 2% on Tradewell Holdings Ltd suggests heightened surveillance concerns.

**Risk Management**: Wider bands (20%) on securities like Ghushine Fintrrade Ocean Ltd, Shlokka Dyes Ltd, Sihora Industries Ltd, SK Minerals & Additives Ltd, and U H ZAVERI Ltd indicate either lower concern or need for greater price discovery, while tighter bands suggest the need for volatility control.
