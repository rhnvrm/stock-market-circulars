These securities will be listed and admitted for trading on the Exchange effective Tuesday, October 28, 2025. The circular lists the specific companies, ISINs, scrip codes, number of shares, face values, and distinctive numbers for each issuance. None of the listed securities are subject to lock-in periods.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced in this circular. This is a routine listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the listing of these new securities in their systems
- The securities will be available for trading from October 28, 2025
- Companies must ensure compliance with existing ESOP/ESOS disclosure and reporting requirements

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 27, 2025
- **Listing and Trading Effective Date**: October 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this circular is minimal. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine administrative process that facilitates employee stock option exercises. The total number of shares being listed (298,994) is relatively small and unlikely to cause significant market movement. The absence of lock-in periods means these shares are immediately tradable, but given the quantities involved, no substantial liquidity or price impact is expected. This circular primarily serves to inform trading members of the availability of these securities for trading.
