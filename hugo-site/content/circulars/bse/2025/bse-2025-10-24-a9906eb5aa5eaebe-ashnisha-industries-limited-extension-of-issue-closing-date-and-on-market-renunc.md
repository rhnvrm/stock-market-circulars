## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium. The extension provides additional opportunity for shareholders to participate in the rights issue, potentially improving subscription levels. The 8-day extension may positively impact overall participation rates.

**Shareholder Impact:** Medium. Existing shareholders have more time to arrange funds and make informed decisions about exercising their rights or renouncing them on the market. Extended renunciation trading period until November 4, 2025 provides greater flexibility for those wishing to sell their entitlements.

**Operational Impact:** Low. The extension is procedural and affects only the timeline. All other terms and conditions of the Rights Issue remain unchanged as per the original LOF and CAF dated October 3, 2025.
