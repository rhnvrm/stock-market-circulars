## Summary

BSE has announced the listing and trading permission for 175 bonus equity shares of ICICI Bank Limited (Scrip Code: 532174) that were kept in abeyance. These shares will be listed and permitted to trade effective from Wednesday, November 12, 2025. The shares have a face value of Rs. 2/- each and are allocated under ISIN INE090A01021.

## Key Points

- 175 bonus equity shares of Rs. 2/- each kept in abeyance are now being listed
- Scrip Code: 532174
- ISIN: INE090A01021
- Shares distributed across three distinctive number ranges: 75 shares (6412604387-6412604461), 50 shares (6412305013-6412305062), and 50 shares (6412300863-6412300912)
- Notice Number: 20251111-26

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard administrative listing notification for shares previously kept in abeyance.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members of BSE are informed to note the listing of these securities for trading purposes. No specific compliance actions required beyond standard trading protocols.

## Important Dates

- Notice Date: November 11, 2025
- Trading Commencement Date: Wednesday, November 12, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact is minimal as only 175 bonus shares are being listed. These shares were kept in abeyance and are now being released for specific shareholders. Given the small quantity relative to ICICI Bank's total outstanding shares, there will be negligible impact on market liquidity or stock price. This is a routine administrative action completing the bonus share distribution process for shareholders whose entitlements were previously held in abeyance.
