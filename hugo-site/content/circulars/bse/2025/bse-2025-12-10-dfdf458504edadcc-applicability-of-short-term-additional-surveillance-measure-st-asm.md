## Regulatory Framework Details

**Short Term ASM Framework** is designed to alert investors about securities showing abnormal price movements or unusual trading patterns over short periods (5/15/30 days). Securities under this measure face enhanced surveillance and potential trading restrictions.

**Framework Transitions:**
- Securities marked with ($) move to Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework
- Securities marked with (*) move to Long Term ASM (LT-ASM) Framework
- Securities marked with (@) indicate SME scrips
- Securities marked with (~) indicate T+0 scrips shortlisted as per parent company

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 11, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The addition of 5 securities to ST-ASM may result in reduced liquidity and higher trading costs for these stocks. Investors should exercise caution when trading these securities.

**Investor Impact:** Securities under ST-ASM framework typically face additional price bands, higher margin requirements, and potential restrictions on intraday trading, which may affect short-term trading strategies.

**Positive Development:** One security moving to lower stage indicates improved price stability, while 8 securities exiting the framework (though some moving to other surveillance measures) suggests varied market conditions across different stocks.
