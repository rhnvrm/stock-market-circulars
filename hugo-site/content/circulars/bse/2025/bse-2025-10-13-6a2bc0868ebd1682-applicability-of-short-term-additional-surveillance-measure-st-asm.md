## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework is a short-term surveillance mechanism applied to securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or trading patterns. Securities under this framework are subject to additional surveillance measures for periods of 5, 15, or 30 days depending on the stage. The framework aims to protect investor interests and maintain market integrity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must take note of securities under ST-ASM framework
- Enhanced due diligence may be required for transactions in these securities
- Clients should be informed about the surveillance status of these securities
- Additional margin requirements or trading restrictions may apply to securities under ST-ASM

## Important Dates

- **October 14, 2025**: Effective date for all changes to ST-ASM framework
  - 7 new securities enter ST-ASM
  - 7 securities exit ST-ASM

## Impact Assessment

The ST-ASM framework impacts liquidity and trading conditions for the affected securities. Securities entering the framework may experience:
- Reduced trading activity due to additional surveillance
- Potential margin increases
- Enhanced scrutiny of trading patterns

Securities exiting ST-ASM either graduate to stricter frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM) or have normalized trading patterns. Investors holding these securities should review their positions and understand the implications of the surveillance measures. The transition of some securities to ESM and LT-ASM indicates continued concerns requiring longer-term or more stringent surveillance.
