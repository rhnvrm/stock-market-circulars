title: Resumption of Subscription in fresh subscriptions of Invesco Mutual Fund
---

## Summary

Invesco Mutual Fund has revoked the temporary suspension of subscriptions in three overseas fund of fund schemes, effective December 5, 2025. The suspension was originally imposed on October 9, 2025. Subscriptions through lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh registrations for SIP/STP/IDCW Transfer Plans will now be permitted subject to available headroom within overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022.

## Key Points

- Suspension revoked for three designated overseas fund of fund schemes effective December 5, 2025
- Affected schemes: Invesco India - Invesco Global Equity Income Fund of Fund, Invesco India - Invesco Pan European Equity Fund of Fund, and Invesco India - Invesco Global Consumer Trends Fund of Fund
- Subscriptions allowed through lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh registrations for SIP/STP/IDCW Transfer Plans
- Subscriptions subject to available headroom within overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022 at Fund level
- AMC reserves right to re-suspend subscriptions if overseas investment limits are approached
- All other terms and conditions of SIDs and KIMs remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. The notice implements operational changes to manage compliance with existing overseas investment limits established as of February 1, 2022.

## Compliance Requirements

- Invesco Asset Management must monitor overseas investment levels against February 1, 2022 limits
- AMC must suspend subscriptions if limits are approached
- Notice cum addendum forms integral part of Scheme Information Documents (SIDs) and Key Information Memorandums (KIMs)

## Important Dates

- **October 9, 2025**: Original suspension notice issued
- **December 3, 2025**: Current notice dated
- **December 5, 2025**: Effective date for resumption of subscriptions in designated schemes
- **February 1, 2022**: Reference date for overseas investment limits

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Existing and prospective investors in the three designated overseas fund of fund schemes can now make fresh investments through multiple channels (lumpsum, SIP, STP, IDCW Transfer Plans). However, subscriptions remain conditional on available headroom and may be re-suspended without prior notice.

**Market Impact**: Limited direct market impact as this affects only specific mutual fund schemes. The resumption provides liquidity options for investors interested in global equity exposure through fund of fund structures.

**Operational Impact**: Invesco must actively monitor overseas investment levels and maintain flexibility to suspend subscriptions quickly if limits are approached, requiring robust monitoring systems.
