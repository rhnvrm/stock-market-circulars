**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium - Impacts debt market participants, particularly those utilizing the non-competitive bidding facility. Trading members need to coordinate with their clients and ensure timely bid submission within the specified timelines.

**Investor Impact**: The non-competitive bidding facility allows retail and smaller institutional investors to participate in government securities auctions without competing on price, making T-Bills accessible to a broader investor base. The minimum investment of Rs. 10,000 keeps the entry barrier relatively low.
