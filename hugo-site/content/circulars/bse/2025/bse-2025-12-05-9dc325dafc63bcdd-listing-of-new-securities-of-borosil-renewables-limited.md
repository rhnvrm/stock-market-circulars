## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The addition of 25,471 shares represents a small increment to Borosil Renewables Limited's total outstanding equity and is unlikely to materially affect trading volumes or liquidity.

**Company Impact**: Standard capital raising activity through warrant conversion. The preferential allotment to non-promoters provides additional capital to the company.

**Investor Impact**: Lock-in period until June 10, 2026 means these shares cannot be traded immediately, reducing potential supply pressure. Investors should note the existence of these locked-in shares when analyzing the company's free float.
