## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Inform all clients about commencement of trading in REs, mentioning the ISIN (INE549A20026)
- Clarify that REs should not be mistaken for ordinary shares of HCC
- Include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases stating:
  - Purchase of REs gives right to participate in ongoing Rights Issue by making application with requisite money
  - REs can be renounced before issue closes
  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced before Issue Closing Date shall lapse and be extinguished
- Refer to notices 20200305-21 and 20200518-34 for additional guidance

**For Investors:**
- REs must be held in demat form for trading
- Decide to either subscribe, renounce, or allow REs to lapse before December 22, 2025

## Important Dates

- **December 12, 2025**: Rights Entitlements trading begins; Rights Issue opens
- **December 17, 2025**: Last day for trading REs for renunciation
- **December 22, 2025**: Rights Issue closes; last day to subscribe or renounce REs
- **Post December 22, 2025**: Unsubscribed and unrenounced REs will lapse and be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects only HCC shareholders and potential investors interested in the rights issue.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure proper communication to clients about RE characteristics and deadlines. The 6-day renunciation trading window (Dec 12-17) is shorter than the full 11-day rights issue period (Dec 12-22), requiring timely action from shareholders wishing to trade their entitlements.

**Shareholder Impact:** Existing HCC shareholders have three options: (1) subscribe to the rights issue with application money, (2) renounce/sell their REs in the market between Dec 12-17, or (3) allow REs to lapse. Failure to act results in automatic lapse of entitlements.
