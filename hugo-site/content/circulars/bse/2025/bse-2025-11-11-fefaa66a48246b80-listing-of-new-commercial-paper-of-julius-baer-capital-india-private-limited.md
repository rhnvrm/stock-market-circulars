## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt instrument listing with minimal market impact. The listing of commercial paper on private placement basis is a standard corporate financing activity. The securities will be traded on the debt segment only and do not affect equity markets. The short-term nature of commercial paper (91-day tenure) and private placement basis indicate limited broader market implications.
