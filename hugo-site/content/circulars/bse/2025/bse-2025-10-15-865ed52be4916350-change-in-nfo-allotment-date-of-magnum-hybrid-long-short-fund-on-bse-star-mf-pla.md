---

## Summary

BSE has announced a change in the tentative allotment date for SBI Mutual Fund's MAGNUM HYBRID LONG SHORT FUND (SIF) NFO on the BSE StAR MF Platform. The allotment date has been advanced from October 23, 2025 to October 20, 2025. This change affects payment timelines, transaction processing rules, and the NFO extended period deadline.

## Key Points

- Clear funds must be available in ICCL Account by 6:00 PM on October 20, 2025
- NFO period extended till midnight on October 15, 2025 on BSE StAR MF Platform
- Transactions without client-initiated funds by 9:00 AM on T+1 day will be cancelled
- Transactions with initiated payments remain pending until 3:00 PM on the last payout day to AMC or T+5, whichever is earlier
- Allotment to be done immediately on October 20, 2025
- Cheques and OTM payments acceptable during NFO period subject to clear funds receipt by deadline
- Switches accepted during NFO period subject to fund receipt on or before allotment date

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is an operational schedule modification for an existing NFO process.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Members**: Must ensure clear funds availability in ICCL Account by 6:00 PM on October 20, 2025
- **Payment Processing**: Cheques and OTM payments must result in clear funds in ICCL account by 6:00 PM on October 20, 2025 to avail unit allotment
- **Transaction Cancellation**: Transactions where clients have not initiated funds by 9:00 AM on T+1 day (including extended period transactions) will be cancelled with CC and N flag reported to RTA/AMC
- **Switch Transactions**: Must ensure funds for switch-out scheme are received on or before allotment date; funds received after NFO allotment date will not be considered for allotment

## Important Dates

- **October 15, 2025 (midnight)**: Extended NFO period deadline on BSE StAR MF Platform
- **October 20, 2025 (6:00 PM)**: Deadline for clear funds availability in ICCL Account
- **October 20, 2025**: New tentative allotment date (changed from October 23, 2025)
- **T+1 day (9:00 AM)**: Deadline for client fund initiation to avoid transaction cancellation
- **T+5 or last payout day (3:00 PM)**: Pending transaction deadline (whichever is earlier)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - The three-day advancement of the allotment date requires members and investors to adjust their payment and settlement timelines. The accelerated schedule compresses the timeframe for fund clearing and transaction processing.

**Market Participants Affected**: BSE StAR MF platform members, distributors, and investors participating in the MAGNUM HYBRID LONG SHORT FUND NFO.

**Process Changes**: Tighter deadlines for payment processing and fund availability. Members must ensure operational readiness to meet the advanced allotment date and associated payment timelines.

**Risk Factors**: Potential for increased transaction cancellations if clients are not informed of the accelerated timeline and updated fund initiation requirements.
