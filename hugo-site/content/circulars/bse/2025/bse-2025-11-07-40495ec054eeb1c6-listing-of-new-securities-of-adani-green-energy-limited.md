- **Trading Commencement**: November 10, 2025 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Period Ends**: May 14, 2027

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. While the number of shares is significant (approximately 5.5 million shares), the 2-year lock-in period until May 2027 means these shares will not be available for trading in the immediate term, limiting potential dilution or supply pressure on the stock price.

**Shareholding Impact**: Increases promoter shareholding through conversion of warrants issued earlier. The preferential allotment strengthens promoter stake in the company.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact on market liquidity as shares are locked-in. The shares will rank pari-passu with existing shares and will add to the equity base once lock-in expires.

**Financial Impact**: The allotment raised approximately Rs. 818.42 crores (55,27,802 shares × Rs. 1,480.75) for the company, providing capital for business expansion and operations.
