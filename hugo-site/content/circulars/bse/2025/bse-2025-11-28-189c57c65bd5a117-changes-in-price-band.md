title: Revision of Price Bands for 31 Securities Effective December 1, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced revisions to price bands for 31 securities, effective December 1, 2025. The revised bands range from 2% to 20%, representing tightened or adjusted trading limits. These changes are surveillance measures to control price volatility in specific scrips, including companies like Alan Scott Enterprises (2%), Mcleod Russel India (5%), Oceanic Foods (20%), and Trescon (10%).

## Key Points

- 31 securities will have revised price bands effective December 1, 2025
- Price band percentages range from 2% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive)
- Majority of securities (22 out of 31) have 5% price band
- 3 securities have 2% band: Alan Scott Enterprises, Emergent Industrial Solutions
- 5 securities have 10% band: Captain Technocast, Gilada Finance, Trescon, Tuni Textile Mills, Varvee Global
- 1 security has 20% band: Oceanic Foods
- Changes implemented under BSE Surveillance division
- Trading members notified via Notice No 20251128-48

## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions are surveillance measures under BSE's market oversight framework. Price bands limit the maximum price movement (up or down) allowed in a single trading session. Tighter bands (2%-5%) indicate higher surveillance concern, while wider bands (10%-20%) allow more price discovery. These revisions typically respond to volatility patterns, liquidity concerns, or compliance issues.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect new price band limits by December 1, 2025
- Orders exceeding revised price bands will be rejected starting December 1, 2025
- Members should ensure clients are informed about trading restrictions on affected securities
- For clarifications, members may contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com
- No action required from investors, but awareness of trading limits is recommended

## Important Dates

- **November 28, 2025**: Notice issued
- **December 1, 2025**: Revised price bands take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Moderate. The 31 affected securities represent a small fraction of BSE-listed stocks, limiting systemic impact. However, investors and traders in these specific scrips will experience restricted price movements.

**Trading Impact**: High for affected securities. Tighter price bands (2%-5%) will significantly limit intraday volatility, potentially reducing liquidity and making large trades more difficult. The 2% band on Alan Scott Enterprises and Emergent Industrial Solutions indicates heightened surveillance concerns.

**Investor Impact**: Medium. Long-term investors are minimally affected, but day traders and short-term traders will face constraints. Oceanic Foods with 20% band has the most trading flexibility among the list.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update risk management systems and notify clients. Automated trading systems require reconfiguration to prevent order rejections.
