---

## Summary

BSE has announced mandatory adjustments to all Futures and Options contracts of Computer Age Management Services Ltd (CAMS, Scrip Code: 543232) following the company's stock split. The company will subdivide one equity share of Rs. 10 each into five equity shares of Rs. 2 each, with a record date of December 05, 2025. The exchange will implement adjustments at end of day on December 04, 2025 (ex-date: December 05, 2025) in compliance with SEBI guidelines.

## Key Points

- Stock split ratio: 1:5 (one share of Rs. 10 split into five shares of Rs. 2)
- Adjustment factor: 5 (calculated as 5/1)
- Record date: December 05, 2025
- Adjustment implementation: End of day December 04, 2025
- Applies to all available Futures & Options contracts on CAMS
- Derivatives Asset Code: CAMS
- Scrip Code: 543232

## Regulatory Changes

Adjustments are being made in pursuance of SEBI guidelines for adjustment of Futures & Options Contracts on announcement of corporate actions. The exchange is mandated to adjust all derivative contracts to reflect the underlying stock split.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Be aware of all adjusted contract specifications effective December 05, 2025
- Update systems and risk management parameters for revised strike prices, market lot, and positions
- Contact designated Relationship Managers for clarifications
- Inform clients holding CAMS F&O positions about the adjustments

**Contract Adjustments:**

1. **Strike Price**: Divide old strike price by adjustment factor (5)
   - Example: 3100 → 620, 3200 → 640, 3300 → 660, 3400 → 680

2. **Market Lot**: Multiply old market lot by adjustment factor (5)
   - Old market lot: 150
   - New market lot: 750 (150 × 5)

3. **Position**: Multiply old position by adjustment factor (5)

4. **Futures Price**: Divide old futures price by adjustment factor (5), rounded to nearest tick size

## Important Dates

- **November 24, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **December 04, 2025**: Adjustments to be implemented at end of day
- **December 05, 2025**: Ex-date and record date for stock split

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - All existing CAMS derivatives positions will be automatically adjusted with a 5x adjustment factor, significantly affecting contract values, strike prices, and lot sizes.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their systems, risk management frameworks, and margin requirements to reflect the new contract specifications. The 5x increase in market lot (150 to 750 shares) will substantially increase the notional value per contract.

**Investor Impact:** All traders holding CAMS F&O positions will see their positions adjusted automatically. Strike prices will be divided by 5, while the number of contracts and market lot will be multiplied by 5, maintaining equivalent economic exposure but with different contract parameters.
