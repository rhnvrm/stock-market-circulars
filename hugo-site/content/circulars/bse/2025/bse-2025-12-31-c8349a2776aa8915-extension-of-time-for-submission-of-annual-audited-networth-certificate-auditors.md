## Summary

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has issued General Circular No. 08/2025 dated December 30, 2025, extending the deadline for filing annual financial statements and annual returns for FY 2024-25. Companies can now complete their annual filings up to January 31, 2026 without payment of additional fees. This circular continues the relief measures introduced in General Circular No. 06/2025 dated October 17, 2025.

## Key Points

- Extension granted for filing e-Forms pertaining to FY 2024-25 until January 31, 2026
- No additional fees will be charged for filings made within the extended deadline
- Applies to Forms: MGT-7, MGT-7A, AOC-4, AOC-4 CFS, AOC-4 NBFC (Ind AS), AOC-4 CFS NBFC (Ind AS), and AOC-4 (XBRL)
- Extension granted in response to stakeholder representations
- All other requirements of General Circular No. 06/2025 remain unchanged
- Circular issued with competent authority approval

## Regulatory Changes

This circular modifies the timeline for annual compliance filing requirements under the Companies Act, 2013. It provides temporary relief by waiving additional fees that would normally apply to late filings. The extension specifically covers:

- **MGT-7/MGT-7A**: Annual Return forms
- **AOC-4 series**: Financial statements and accounts in various formats including standalone, consolidated (CFS), NBFC-specific (Ind AS), and XBRL formats

The circular is issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs under File No. Policy-17/111/2022-CL-V-MCA and supersedes the timeline provisions in the previous circular while maintaining all other requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

**Applicable Entities**: All companies required to file annual returns and financial statements under the Companies Act, 2013

2. Complete and file Forms AOC-4 series (Financial Statements and Accounts) for FY 2024-25
3. Ensure filings are completed by January 31, 2026 to avoid additional fees
4. Continue to comply with all other requirements specified in General Circular No. 06/2025

**Forms Covered**:
- MGT-7 (Annual Return)

## Important Dates

- **December 30, 2025**: Date of circular issuance
- **January 31, 2026**: Extended deadline for filing annual returns and financial statements for FY 2024-25 without additional fees
- **Reference**: Circular continues relief measures from General Circular No. 06/2025 dated October 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact**:
- Provides significant compliance relief to all companies by extending the filing deadline
- Eliminates financial burden of additional fees for companies facing difficulties in meeting original deadlines
- Demonstrates regulatory responsiveness to stakeholder concerns
- Allows companies additional time to ensure accuracy and completeness of annual filings
- Particularly beneficial for companies dealing with year-end audit and reporting complexities

**Operational Considerations**:
- Companies should utilize the extended time to ensure compliance with all filing requirements
- Auditors and company secretaries gain additional time to complete and verify annual filings
- ROC and MCA systems may experience higher filing volumes closer to the January 31, 2026 deadline
- Companies should not delay filings unnecessarily and should aim to complete them as early as possible

**Market Impact**: Neutral to positive - ensures companies remain compliant without financial penalties, maintaining overall market integrity and regulatory compliance levels
