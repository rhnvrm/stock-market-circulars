## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The demerger involves separation of a complete business division (Yarn Division) which will fundamentally change the business composition of Modern Insulators Ltd. The 1:2 share ratio means significant dilution consideration for shareholders.

**Trading Impact**: High - Movement to XT Group indicates heightened surveillance, typically applied to scrips undergoing corporate actions. SPOS implementation means only call auction trading on ex-date, restricting normal continuous trading.

**Investor Impact**: High - Existing shareholders will receive new shares in a separately listed entity (Modern Polytex Limited). This creates a forced portfolio change and potential tax implications. Investors need to evaluate both entities post-demerger.

**Operational Impact**: The demerger separates the Yarn Division operations located at Surat from the parent company, creating two independent listed entities with distinct business focuses.
