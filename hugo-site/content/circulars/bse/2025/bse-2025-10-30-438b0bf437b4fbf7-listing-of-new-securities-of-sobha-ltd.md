The impact of this listing is minimal given the small quantity of shares (7,320) being added to the tradable pool. This represents a routine corporate action where partly paid shares issued under a rights issue have been fully paid up and are now being listed for trading. The shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares, meaning they carry identical rights and privileges.
