## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The issuance represents a relatively small number of shares (50,000) issued to promoters on a preferential basis. The lock-in period until May 2027 ensures these shares will not be available for trading in the near term, minimizing immediate market impact.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. This is a standard listing procedure following warrant conversion. Trading members need only update their systems to reflect the increased share capital of Comrade Appliances Limited.
