- **Financial Services Sector**: Both HDB Financial Services and Tata Capital being added to BSE Financial Services index strengthens financial sector representation
- **Large Cap Indices**: Addition of LG Electronics India and Tata Capital to BSE LargeCap indicates their market capitalization has reached large-cap thresholds
- **Liquidity**: Inclusion in major indices typically improves stock liquidity and visibility among institutional investors

**Operational Impact**: Market participants will need to adjust index replication strategies, derivatives positions, and benchmark tracking mechanisms before the December 02 effective date.
