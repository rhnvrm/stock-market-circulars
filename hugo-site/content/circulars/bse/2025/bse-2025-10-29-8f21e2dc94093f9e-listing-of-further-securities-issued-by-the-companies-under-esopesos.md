## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced in this circular. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities available for trading
- Companies have fulfilled listing requirements for ESOP/ESOS issued securities
- No lock-in restrictions apply to any of the listed securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 29, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: October 30, 2025 (Thursday)

## Impact Assessment

The market impact is expected to be minimal as these are routine ESOP/ESOS issuances representing small dilutions to existing equity bases. Yes Bank's issuance of 1.29 million shares is the largest but still represents a minor percentage of its total outstanding shares. The absence of lock-in periods means these shares are immediately available for trading, though typical ESOP holders tend to retain shares for tax optimization. No significant price volatility is anticipated from these listings.
