## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The QIP represents a significant capital raise of approximately Rs. 3,500 crore for Brookfield India REIT, one of India's leading real estate investment trusts. This will increase the REIT's capital base for potential acquisitions and development activities.

**Investor Impact**: Existing unitholders will experience dilution of approximately 17-18% (assuming pre-QIP units around 60-62 crore). The issue price of Rs. 320 per unit will serve as a reference point for institutional valuation.

**Operational Impact**: The substantial capital infusion strengthens Brookfield India REIT's ability to pursue growth opportunities in commercial real estate, potentially through acquisitions or development of new properties in its portfolio.
