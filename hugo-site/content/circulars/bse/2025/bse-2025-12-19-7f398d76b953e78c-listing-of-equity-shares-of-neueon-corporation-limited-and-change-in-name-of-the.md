## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Existing Shareholders**: Public shareholders (including erstwhile promoters) collectively retain only 10% of the total issued, subscribed, and paid-up equity share capital after the resolution plan implementation, while 90% is allotted to the Successful Resolution Applicant or its nominees. The capital reduction from Rs. 10 to Rs. 1 per share significantly dilutes existing shareholder value.

**Trading Restrictions**: Continued placement in Trade-to-Trade segment limits intraday trading and requires delivery-based settlement, potentially impacting liquidity. T Group classification indicates higher surveillance and risk categorization.

**Market Access**: Inclusion in special pre-open session provides price discovery mechanism before regular trading, offering some protection to investors in this restructured entity.
