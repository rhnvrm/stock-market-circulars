- Gold and Silver contracts expire on December 5, 2025 with tender period from December 1-5
- SilverKG and SilverM contracts expire on December 31, 2025 with tender period from December 24-31
- Holiday adjustments are included for December 25, 27, and 28, 2025 for SilverKG and SilverM contracts

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine publication of margin requirements for the tender period.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects traders holding positions in gold and silver futures contracts as they approach expiry. The progressive margin increase encourages position squaring before delivery period.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure adequate margin collection from clients holding positions during tender period. The progressive margin structure provides clear visibility for risk management and capital planning for both members and clients trading commodity derivatives on BSE.
