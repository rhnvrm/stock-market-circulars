## Impact Assessment

This corporate action has minimal market impact as it affects only holders of specific debentures issued by INTERISE TRUST. The part redemption will reduce the outstanding face value of these NCDs, providing partial liquidity to debenture holders while maintaining the remaining investment at the reduced face value. Trading members dealing with these debentures need to update their records and trading systems accordingly. No impact on equity markets or broader debt market operations.
