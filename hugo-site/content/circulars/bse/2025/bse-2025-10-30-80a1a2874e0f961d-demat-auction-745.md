## Summary

BSE has published the list of scrips scheduled for demat auction under Settlement No. 745 dated October 30, 2025. The auction covers 104 scrips across various sectors, ranging from large-cap stocks like Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, and State Bank of India to mid and small-cap companies. The quantities range from as low as 1 share to as high as 170,011 shares (Harshil Agro). This auction is conducted to close out pending delivery obligations where sellers have failed to deliver securities.

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Buying brokers whose clients are awaiting delivery of these securities should inform their clients about the auction process
- Selling brokers must ensure funds are available to cover auction purchase costs if their delivery obligations remain unfulfilled
- Market participants should note the scrips and quantities involved for reconciliation purposes
- Members must comply with BSE's auction settlement procedures as per existing regulations

## Important Dates

- Settlement Number: 745
- Auction execution will follow BSE's standard auction settlement timeline

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 104 scrips, indicating delivery failures across multiple trades. While the quantities for most large-cap stocks are relatively small, some mid and small-cap stocks have significant quantities that may face price volatility during auction execution.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Brokers and their clients involved in these trades will face potential financial impact due to auction pricing, which typically occurs at a premium to market prices. YES Bank (8,002 shares), Bandhan Bank (2,701 shares), and BHEL (2,500 shares) have notably high quantities that could result in substantial auction costs.

**Investor Impact:** Buyers awaiting delivery will receive their shares through the auction mechanism, but sellers who failed to deliver will bear the cost difference. This reinforces the importance of ensuring adequate securities in demat accounts before executing sell trades.

**Systemic Impact:** Low - Demat auctions are routine settlement mechanisms and do not indicate broader market issues. The presence of blue-chip stocks in small quantities suggests isolated delivery failures rather than systemic concerns.
