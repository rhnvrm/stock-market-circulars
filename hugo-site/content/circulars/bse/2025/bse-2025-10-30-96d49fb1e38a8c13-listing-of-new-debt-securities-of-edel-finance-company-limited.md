## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it represents a routine private placement of debt securities by Edel Finance Company Limited. The securities have a 3-year tenure with cumulative interest payment at maturity. The CRISIL A+/STABLE rating indicates adequate safety with stable outlook. Impact is limited to debt market participants, institutional investors, and existing stakeholders of Edel Finance Company Limited. The high face value (Rs. 1 lakh) suggests these securities are targeted at institutional and high net-worth investors rather than retail participants.
