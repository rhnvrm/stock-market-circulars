- **Listing Date**: December 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The listing represents a capital raise through preferential allotment to promoters via warrant conversion. All 2 million shares are subject to lock-in until June 30, 2027, meaning they cannot be traded on the market during this period, limiting immediate liquidity impact.

**Shareholder Impact**: The preferential allotment to promoters may increase promoter holding percentage. The lock-in period ensures promoter commitment for approximately 1.5 years from the listing date.

**Company Impact**: The fundraise of Rs. 24 crores (2 million shares × Rs. 120) strengthens the company's capital base and demonstrates promoter confidence through warrant conversion and long-term lock-in commitment.
