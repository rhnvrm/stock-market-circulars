## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 90 scrips with varying quantities. While this is a routine settlement mechanism, the breadth of securities involved indicates delivery failures across multiple stocks.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading members with short delivery positions must participate in the auction, potentially at premium prices, affecting their settlement costs.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Investors who were expecting delivery may experience delays. The auction mechanism ensures eventual delivery but may result in price variations from the original transaction price.
