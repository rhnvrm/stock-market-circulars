- **December 29, 2025**: Indicated maturity date (based on debenture nomenclature)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High impact on debenture holders and trading members. The suspension prevents any secondary market trading, effectively locking in current holders until redemption. Investors seeking liquidity before redemption date will be unable to exit their positions.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trades in these securities and communicate the suspension to clients. Back-office operations need to prepare for redemption processing and interest payment distributions.

**Financial Impact**: Debenture holders will receive their principal redemption and final interest payment on the record date. No trading opportunities available for arbitrage or portfolio adjustments after December 12, 2025.
