## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction involves 76 scrips with varying quantities. While this is a routine settlement process, the involvement of major scrips like Infosys, Biocon, and Tech Mahindra, along with significant quantities in some counters (Avance Technologies with 119,138 shares), may cause temporary price volatility in affected scrips.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Brokers and clearing members with delivery shortfalls in these scrips must arrange for securities through the auction mechanism. The wide range of quantities (from 1 share to over 100,000 shares) indicates varying degrees of settlement pressure across different scrips.

**Member Impact:** Members with outstanding obligations in the listed scrips will face auction settlement costs, which typically include auction premiums and associated charges, potentially affecting their operational margins for these transactions.
