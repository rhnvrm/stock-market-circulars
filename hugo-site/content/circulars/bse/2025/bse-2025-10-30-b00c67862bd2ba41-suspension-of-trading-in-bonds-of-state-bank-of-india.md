## Impact Assessment

This suspension affects bondholders and traders of SBI's perpetual AT1 bonds. The two-day suspension period before the record date ensures proper settlement and determination of eligible bondholders for redemption proceeds and interest payment. Trading members must adjust their positions before November 7, 2025. The redemption will impact the debt market as these are perpetual bonds being redeemed, potentially affecting liquidity in the AT1 bond segment.
