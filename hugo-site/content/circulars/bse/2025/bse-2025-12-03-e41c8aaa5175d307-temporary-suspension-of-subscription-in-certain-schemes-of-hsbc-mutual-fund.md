title: Temporary Suspension of Subscription in Four HSBC Mutual Fund Schemes Investing
  in Overseas Securities
---

## Summary

HSBC Mutual Fund has announced temporary suspension of fresh subscriptions in four schemes that invest in overseas securities, effective from close of business hours on December 03, 2025. This measure is taken to comply with SEBI's overseas investment limits framework established in June 2022, which restricts AMCs from breaching the headroom available as of February 1, 2022. The suspension applies to lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh registrations of SIP/STP/IDCW Transfer Plans but does not affect existing investments, redemptions, or ongoing systematic plans.

## Key Points

- Four HSBC schemes temporarily suspend fresh subscriptions: HSBC Global Equity Climate Change Fund of Fund, HSBC Asia Pacific (Ex Japan) Dividend Yield Fund, HSBC Brazil Fund, and HSBC Global Emerging Markets Fund
- Suspension effective from close of business hours on December 03, 2025 until further notice
- Restricted activities: lumpsum purchases, switch-ins to these schemes, fresh SIP/STP/IDCW Transfer Plan registrations
- Permitted activities: switch-outs, redemptions, switches between plans/options, fresh SWP registrations, processing of existing SIP/STP/IDCW/SWP instalments
- Fresh applications received after 3:00 PM cutoff on Effective Date will be rejected with refund within 5 business days
- Existing SIP and IDCW Transfer Plan instalments will be reviewed based on available headroom
- Suspension driven by SEBI limits on overseas investments established via letter dated June 17, 2022

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes are introduced. This circular implements compliance with existing SEBI framework from June 17, 2022, which permits AMCs to invest in overseas funds/securities only up to the headroom available without breaching overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022 at the Fund level. The temporary suspension is a preventive measure to avoid potential breach of these established limits.

## Compliance Requirements

- HSBC Asset Management (India) Private Limited must monitor overseas investment headroom to prevent breaching SEBI limits
- Processing of existing SIP and IDCW Transfer Plan instalments targeting the designated schemes must be reviewed based on available headroom
- Appropriate notices must be issued from time to time regarding the status of existing systematic plans
- Fresh applications received after cutoff time must be rejected with refunds processed within 5 business days
- All other terms and conditions of SID and KIM remain unchanged

## Important Dates

- **December 03, 2025**: Effective Date - Temporary suspension begins from close of business hours (3:00 PM cutoff for applications)
- **June 17, 2022**: SEBI issued letter permitting AMCs to invest in overseas securities up to headroom available as of February 1, 2022
- **February 1, 2022**: Reference date for determining overseas investment limits baseline
- **Until further notice**: Suspension continues until SEBI/RBI enhances limits or headroom increases

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Investors seeking fresh exposure to these four international equity schemes will be unable to invest through lumpsum or new systematic plans. Existing investors can continue redeeming and existing SIP instalments will be processed subject to headroom availability. This limits investment options for those seeking diversification through overseas markets including global climate change themes, Asia Pacific dividends, Brazil, and global emerging markets.

**Market Impact**: Limited direct market impact as this affects specific mutual fund schemes rather than broader market operations. Reflects broader industry challenge of managing overseas investment limits imposed by SEBI/RBI framework.

**Operational Impact**: HSBC Asset Management must closely monitor headroom and review processing of existing systematic plans on ongoing basis. The suspension will remain until regulatory limits are enhanced or market conditions provide additional headroom, creating operational uncertainty regarding timeline for resumption of normal subscription activities.
