## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification with minimal market-wide impact. The securities are privately placed debt instruments with a CARE B credit rating, indicating higher credit risk. The listing affects only investors who participated in the private placement and trading members dealing in debt securities. The relatively small issue size (500 debentures) and private placement nature limit broader market implications.
