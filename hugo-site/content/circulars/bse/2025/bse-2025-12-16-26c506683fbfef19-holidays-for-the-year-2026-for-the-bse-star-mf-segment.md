## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - All mutual fund segment participants need to plan their trading activities, settlement schedules, and client communications around these 15 non-trading days. This is essential for operational planning and resource allocation.

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine annual notification that provides advance notice for calendar planning. The holidays are standard Indian public holidays that market participants expect annually.

**Planning Considerations**: The concentration of holidays in certain months (4 holidays in March-April, 3 holidays in October-November) may affect trading volumes and require adjusted operational planning during these periods.
