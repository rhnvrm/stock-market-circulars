## Impact Assessment

This is a routine preferential allotment with minimal market impact. The relatively small issuance of 270,000 shares at Rs. 250/- per share (total value of Rs. 6.75 crores) represents a modest capital raise. The six-month lock-in period on all shares ensures no immediate dilution impact on existing shareholders. Trading members should update their records to reflect the new share capital and distinctive numbers.
