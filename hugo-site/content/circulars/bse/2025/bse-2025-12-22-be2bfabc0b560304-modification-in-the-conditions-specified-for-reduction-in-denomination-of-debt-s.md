## Summary

SEBI has modified Clause 1.3 of Chapter V of the NCS Master Circular to allow zero coupon debt securities to be issued at a reduced face value of Rs. Ten Thousand. Previously, only interest/dividend bearing securities paying regular coupons could be issued at this reduced denomination. The amendment recognizes that zero coupon bonds, which are issued at a discount and redeemed at par, provide investors with compounded returns and portfolio diversification opportunities.

## Key Points

- Zero coupon debt securities can now be issued at face value of Rs. Ten Thousand on private placement basis
- Zero coupon bonds must have fixed maturity without structured obligations
- These instruments are issued at a discount and redeemed at par, with returns realized through the difference
- The modification expands the July 03, 2024 circular (SEBI/HO/DDHS/DDHS-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/94) which originally allowed only interest/dividend bearing securities at reduced denomination
- Applies to both debt securities and non-convertible redeemable preference shares
- All other conditions for reduced denomination issuance remain unchanged (including appointment of debenture trustee)

## Regulatory Changes

Clause 1.3 of Chapter V of the Master Circular no. SEBI/HO/DDHS/DDHS-PoD/P/CIR/2025/0000000137 dated October 15, 2025 has been partially modified.

**Previous Requirement:**
Debt securities at Rs. Ten Thousand face value had to be "interest/dividend bearing security paying coupon/dividend at regular intervals with a fixed maturity without any structured obligations"

**Modified Requirement:**
Debt securities at Rs. Ten Thousand face value can now be either:
- Interest/dividend bearing security paying coupon/dividend at regular intervals with fixed maturity without structured obligations; OR
- Zero coupon debt security with fixed maturity without structured obligations

## Compliance Requirements

**Applicable to:**
- Issuers who have listed and/or propose to list non-convertible securities
- Recognized Stock Exchanges
- Registered Depositories
- Registered Credit Rating Agencies
- Debenture Trustees
- Merchant Bankers
- Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents
- Bankers to an Issue

**Requirements:**
- Issuers must appoint debenture trustee (as per existing conditions)
- Zero coupon debt securities must have fixed maturity
- No structured obligations are permitted
- All other conditions from the original circular remain applicable

## Important Dates

- **Circular Reference Date:** July 03, 2024 (SEBI/HO/DDHS/DDHS-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/94)
- **Master Circular Date:** October 15, 2025 (SEBI/HO/DDHS/DDHS-PoD/P/CIR/2025/0000000137)
- **Current Circular Date:** December 18, 2025
- **Effective Date:** Immediate (no specific implementation date mentioned)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Increases flexibility for debt issuers to structure offerings at reduced denominations
- Expands investor access to zero coupon instruments at lower entry points (Rs. Ten Thousand vs. higher denominations)
- May increase liquidity in the debt market by allowing smaller ticket sizes for zero coupon bonds

**Operational Impact:**
- Issuers gain additional structuring options for private placement debt securities
- Zero coupon bonds provide compounded returns without interim payouts, attractive for long-term investors
- Investors benefit from portfolio diversification opportunities through discounted issuance structures

**Regulatory Rationale:**
Market participants highlighted that zero coupon bonds are economically similar to interest-bearing securities as they provide returns through discount-to-par structure, justifying their inclusion in the reduced denomination framework. The exclusion was deemed unnecessary given their fixed maturity and structured return profile.
