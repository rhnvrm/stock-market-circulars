## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - Demat auctions are routine settlement mechanisms that handle delivery failures. The quantities involved are relatively small and affect specific brokers/clients with delivery obligations.

**Operational Impact:** Limited to participants with delivery shortfalls in the listed securities. Most quantities are small (under 500 shares) though some scrips like Fineotex Chemicals (8,159 shares), LS Industries (1,165 shares), and Wardwizard Innovations (2,994 shares) have higher volumes.

**Investor Impact:** Minimal for general investors. Only affects those with pending delivery obligations in the specified securities.
