## Summary

Samco Asset Management Private Limited has announced two key changes to its mutual fund schemes effective July 11, 2025: introduction of weekly SIP frequency and reduction in minimum SIP installment amounts from Rs. 500 to Rs. 250 for amounts up to Rs. 1,000.

## Key Points

- Introduction of weekly SIP frequency (Monday to Friday) for all open-ended schemes
- Reduction in minimum SIP amount from Rs. 500 to Rs. 250 for daily and monthly SIPs
- Lower minimum installment requirements: 24 installments for amounts up to Rs. 1,000, 6 installments for Rs. 1,000 and above
- Special provisions for Samco ELSS Tax Saver Fund with Rs. 500 minimum in multiples of Rs. 500
- Changes apply to new SIP enrollments on or after July 11, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Amendment to Statement of Additional Information (SAI), Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) to reflect new SIP terms and conditions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Fund house to update all scheme documents (SAI, SID, KIM)
- New SIP enrollments must comply with revised minimum amounts and installment requirements
- Existing SIPs remain unaffected by these changes

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 11, 2025
- **Notice Date**: July 11, 2025
- **Applicability**: New SIP enrollments on or after effective date

## Impact Assessment

Positive impact on retail investor participation by lowering entry barriers. Weekly SIP option provides more flexibility for investors. Changes make mutual fund investments more accessible to smaller investors while maintaining fund house operational efficiency.
