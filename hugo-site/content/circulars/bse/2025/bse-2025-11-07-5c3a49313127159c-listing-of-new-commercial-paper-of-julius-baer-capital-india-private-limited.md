## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt market listing with minimal market-wide impact. The listing adds short-term debt instruments to BSE's debt segment for institutional investors and trading members dealing in commercial paper. The high credit ratings (A1+ from both CRISIL and ICRA) indicate strong creditworthiness. The discount to face value (issue price of Rs.4,91,628.50 against face value of Rs.5,00,000) represents the implicit yield for investors. Impact is limited to debt segment participants and does not affect equity markets or broader trading operations.
