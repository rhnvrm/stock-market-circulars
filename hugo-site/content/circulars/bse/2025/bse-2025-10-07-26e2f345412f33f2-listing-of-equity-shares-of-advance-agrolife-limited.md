## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The phased unlock of shares over 18 months will gradually increase the free float. The immediate free float is limited to 21% of total shares (public IPO portion), which may affect liquidity in the initial trading period.

**Trading Implications**:
- Short-term: Limited supply with only 13.5 million shares freely tradable
- November 2025: Additional 2.89 million shares (30-day anchor lock-in expires)
- January 2026: Further 2.89 million shares (90-day anchor lock-in expires)
- April 2026: Significant unlock of 34.4 million shares (6-month lock-in expires)
- April 2027: Final unlock of 13.7 million shares (18-month lock-in expires)

**Investor Considerations**: Lock-in expiry dates are critical for understanding future supply dynamics and potential price pressure points.
