title: Cancellation of shifting of Viji Finance Ltd to 'Z' group
---

## Summary

BSE has cancelled the shifting of Viji Finance Ltd (scrip code 537820) to the 'Z' group, which was previously announced in Exchange Notice No. 20251215-21 dated December 15, 2025. The company will not be moved to 'Z' group effective December 26, 2025 as originally planned.

## Key Points

- Notice cancels previous decision to shift Viji Finance Ltd to 'Z' group
- Scrip code: 537820
- Cancellation effective from December 26, 2025
- Refers to earlier notice dated December 15, 2025 (Notice No. 20251215-21)
- All other provisions of the original notice remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This notice reverses a previously announced trading category change for one company.

## Compliance Requirements

Market participants should note that Viji Finance Ltd will continue trading in its current group and will not be shifted to 'Z' group as previously announced. No specific compliance action required from market participants.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 23, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 26, 2025 (date when shift was to occur, now cancelled)
- **Original Notice Date**: December 15, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a positive development for Viji Finance Ltd as the 'Z' group classification (typically assigned to companies with compliance issues or pending corporate actions) has been cancelled. The stock will continue normal trading without the restrictions associated with 'Z' group securities. Impact is limited to a single scrip with likely low trading volumes.
