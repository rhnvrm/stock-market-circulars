## Regulatory Changes

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects all equity derivatives traders and market makers. Proper strike price intervals ensure balanced liquidity across the options chain.

**Operational Impact:** Low to Medium - Trading systems and platforms need to maintain accurate strike price interval data for contract generation and display.

**Trader Impact:** Medium - Strike price intervals affect option strategy implementation, particularly for specific strike selection in strategies like iron condors, butterflies, and calendar spreads. Wider intervals reduce choice but may concentrate liquidity.
