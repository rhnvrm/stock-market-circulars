## Impact Assessment

Low impact on overall market operations. Demat auctions are routine mechanisms to resolve delivery failures in the settlement system. The auction ensures that investors who were supposed to receive shares can obtain them, while penalizing brokers/clients who failed to deliver. The relatively small quantities for most scrips indicate minor settlement issues rather than systemic problems.
