  'Encumbrance' as per Reg. 28(3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulation 2011
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update on the surveillance measure for companies with high promoter as well as non-promoter encumbrance as per Regulation 28(3) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulation 2011. One security has been added to the framework effective December 09, 2025, bringing the total consolidated list to 7 securities.

## Key Points

- Premier Energy and Infrastructure Ltd (Scrip Code: 533100, ISIN: INE429K01012) has been newly added to the high encumbrance surveillance measure
- No securities are moving out of the framework in this update
- The consolidated list now contains 7 securities under this surveillance measure
- This measure is applied when companies have high levels of pledged shares by both promoters and non-promoters
- Changes are effective from December 09, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements surveillance measures under Regulation 28(3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulation 2011, which requires disclosure of encumbrance created on shares. The framework identifies companies where significant portions of shareholding (both promoter and non-promoter) are encumbered or pledged, potentially indicating financial stress or elevated risk.

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies must comply with disclosure requirements regarding encumbrance of shares
- Companies must maintain compliance with SEBI (SAST) Regulation 2011 regarding substantial acquisition and encumbrance disclosures
- Market participants should be aware of additional surveillance applicable to these securities
- Enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions may apply to securities in this framework

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 09, 2025 - Implementation of updated surveillance measure list

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of Premier Energy and Infrastructure Ltd to the high encumbrance framework signals elevated risk levels for this security. Investors should exercise caution when trading in this stock.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under this measure may face enhanced surveillance, potential price bands, or other trading restrictions to protect investors. The presence of high encumbrance levels indicates that significant portions of shares are pledged, which could lead to forced selling if margin calls occur.

**Investor Protection**: This measure serves as a warning mechanism for investors about companies where shareholding encumbrance poses potential risks to market stability and shareholder interests.

The following 7 securities are currently under this surveillance measure:

1. **B. L. Kashyap and Sons Ltd** (532719 | INE350H01032)
