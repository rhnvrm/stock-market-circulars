The order stems from the Investment Adviser's failure to cooperate during a scheduled inspection and non-compliance with the requirement to keep SEBI informed about changes in contact details as mandated under Regulation 13(b) of SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulation, 2013.

- Violation of Regulation 13(b) of SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulation, 2013 which requires IAs to inform SEBI of any material changes in information including contact details

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This order affects a single Investment Adviser and does not have broader market implications.

**Regulatory Impact**: Medium - Reinforces SEBI's strict enforcement of compliance requirements for registered intermediaries, particularly regarding maintaining current contact information and cooperating with inspections.

**Industry Impact**: This case serves as a reminder to all Investment Advisers about their ongoing obligations to:
1. Maintain accurate and current registration details with SEBI
2. Be available and cooperative during regulatory inspections
3. Respond promptly to communications from SEBI and stock exchanges

**Investor Protection**: The action demonstrates SEBI's commitment to ensuring that registered Investment Advisers remain accessible and accountable to both regulators and clients. Non-cooperative behavior and outdated contact information raise concerns about investor protection and the ability of clients to reach their advisers.
