## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine listing notification following preferential allotment procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are informed of the new securities listing and lock-in restrictions. All 5,70,000 shares are subject to lock-in provisions and cannot be transferred until June 30, 2026.

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: October 22, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this is a standard preferential allotment listing for a single company. The lock-in period until June 30, 2026 ensures these shares will not add to immediate market liquidity. The issuance represents capital raising through warrant conversion, which is a routine corporate action with no broader market implications.
