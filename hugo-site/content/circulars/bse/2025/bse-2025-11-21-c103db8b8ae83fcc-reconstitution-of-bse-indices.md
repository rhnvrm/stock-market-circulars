## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a periodic index reconstitution as part of BSE's standard index maintenance procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Index funds and ETFs tracking these indices must rebalance portfolios to reflect new composition
- Market participants should adjust derivative positions based on revised index constituents
- Fund managers must execute trades at opening prices on effective dates to minimize tracking error

## Important Dates

- **November 21, 2025**: Announcement date
- **December 22, 2025**: Effective date for BSE SENSEX, BSE 100, BSE SENSEX 50, and BSE SENSEX Next 50 reconstitution
- **December 26, 2025**: Effective date for BSE BANKEX reconstitution

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Index reconstitution typically generates significant trading volume as passive funds rebalance. Stocks being added may experience buying pressure while removed stocks may face selling pressure. The addition of Interglobe Aviation to BSE SENSEX and removal of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles is particularly notable given SENSEX's flagship status.

**Sector Impact**: Banking sector sees expansion in BSE BANKEX with addition of four banks, indicating broader representation of the banking sector. Healthcare sector gains prominence with Max Healthcare's inclusion in SENSEX 50.

**Investor Impact**: Passive investors tracking these indices will automatically gain exposure to new constituents and exit removed stocks. Active managers may anticipate these flows for trading opportunities around effective dates.
