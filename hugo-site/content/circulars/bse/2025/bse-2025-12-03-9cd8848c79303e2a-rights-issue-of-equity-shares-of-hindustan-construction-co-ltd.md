The company will issue 277 equity shares of Re.1/- each at a premium of Rs.11.50 per share (total issue price Rs.12.50) for every 630 equity shares held by shareholders. Trading on ex-rights basis will commence from December 5, 2025.

- Shareholders on record as of December 5, 2025 will be eligible to participate in the rights issue
- Issue price of Rs.12.50 per rights share is payable at the time of application

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: December 5, 2025
- **Ex-Rights Trading Commencement**: December 5, 2025
- **Settlement**: DR-771/2025-2026
- **Notice Date**: December 3, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will have the opportunity to subscribe to additional shares at Rs.12.50 per share, representing a premium of Rs.11.50 over face value. The rights entitlement ratio of 277:630 (approximately 44% additional shares) represents a significant equity dilution if fully subscribed.

**Market Impact**: Stock will trade ex-rights from December 5, 2025, which typically results in a price adjustment reflecting the theoretical value of the right. Shareholders not participating in the rights issue will experience dilution of their holdings.

**Trading Impact**: All transactions from December 5, 2025 onwards will be conducted on ex-rights basis, meaning buyers will not be entitled to participate in this rights issue.
