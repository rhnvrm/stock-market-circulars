## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a company-specific listing event affecting only Sanmitra Commercial Ltd. The listing adds liquidity to the stock but represents a dilution of approximately 95% increase in shares outstanding (4.87 crore new shares).

**Investor Impact:** Moderate for existing shareholders due to significant dilution. New shareholders should be aware of lock-in restrictions preventing immediate sale by promoters and non-promoters.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal - Routine listing procedure with standard lock-in provisions as per SEBI regulations for preferential allotment and share swap arrangements.
