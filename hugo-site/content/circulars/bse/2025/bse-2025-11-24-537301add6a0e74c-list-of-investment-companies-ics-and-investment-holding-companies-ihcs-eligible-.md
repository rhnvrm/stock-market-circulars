## Summary

BSE has issued an update regarding Investment Companies (ICs) and Investment Holding Companies (IHCs) eligible for Special Call-Auctions. This notice continues previous communications dated November 13, November 6, November 3, and October 15, 2025. The circular announces the transfer of Haryana Capfin Limited from the trade-for-trade segment to Group X effective December 3, 2025, while Easy Fincorp Limited will continue in the trade-for-trade segment with call auction until further notice.

## Key Points

- Haryana Capfin Limited (Scrip Code: 532855) will be transferred from trade-for-trade segment to Group X effective December 3, 2025
- Easy Fincorp Limited (Scrip Code: 511074) will continue trading in trade-for-trade segment (Group Z) with call auction until further notice
- This notice is a continuation of previous circulars issued on November 13, November 6, November 3, and October 15, 2025
- Trading members are required to note these segment changes for proper execution

## Regulatory Changes

The exchange is implementing segment transfers for Investment Companies (ICs) and Investment Holding Companies (IHCs) as part of ongoing market surveillance and trading arrangement modifications. The transfer from trade-for-trade segment to regular group trading represents a change in the trading mechanism and liquidity arrangements for the affected security.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of the segment change for Haryana Capfin Limited effective December 3, 2025
- Members should ensure their systems are updated to reflect the new group classification (Group X) for Haryana Capfin Limited
- Trading in Easy Fincorp Limited must continue to follow trade-for-trade segment rules with call auction procedures
- For clarifications, trading members should contact Mr. Samit Mattoo at 022-2272 8103

## Important Dates

- **November 24, 2025**: Notice date
- **December 3, 2025**: Effective date for Haryana Capfin Limited's transfer to Group X
- **Until further notice**: Easy Fincorp Limited continues in trade-for-trade segment with call auction

## Impact Assessment

The transfer of Haryana Capfin Limited from trade-for-trade to Group X will likely improve liquidity and trading flexibility for the scrip, as it moves away from the more restrictive trade-for-trade mechanism. This change may attract increased trading interest and potentially reduce execution risk for investors. Conversely, Easy Fincorp Limited remains in the restricted trade-for-trade segment with call auction, indicating continued surveillance concerns. Trading members need to adjust their operational procedures and inform clients about these changes, particularly regarding the different trading mechanisms applicable to each security.
