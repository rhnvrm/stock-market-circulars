  Yarns Limited
---

## Summary

BSE has announced that Rishab Special Yarns Limited (scrip code: 514177) has signed agreements with both depositories, enabling compulsory dematerialised settlement of trades. Effective November 14, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-756/2025-2026), the scrip will move from Group P to Group X, with the market lot revised from 100 shares to 1 share. All trades will be settled in compulsory demat form with netting allowed and shortages subject to auction.

## Key Points

- Scrip code: 514177 (Rishab Special Yarns Limited)
- Group change: P to X
- Market lot revised: 100 shares to 1 share
- Compulsory demat settlement mandatory
- Trading in Normal Rolling Segment
- Netting permitted in the scrip
- Shortages will be auctioned
- ISIN remains: INE351D01013

## Regulatory Changes

The company has completed the necessary agreements with both depositories (NSDL and CDSL), enabling the transition to compulsory dematerialised settlement. This marks a shift from the previous settlement framework to mandatory demat-only trading and settlement.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must:
- Ensure all trades in scrip code 514177 are settled in dematerialised form only from November 14, 2025
- Adjust trading systems to reflect the new market lot of 1 equity share (reduced from 100 shares)
- Recognize the scrip's movement from Group P to Group X
- Be prepared for auction procedures in case of settlement shortages
- Update client communication regarding the new trading modalities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 14, 2025 (Friday)
- **Settlement Number**: DR-756/2025-2026
- **Notice Date**: November 13, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems and procedures to accommodate the reduced market lot from 100 to 1 share, which increases trading flexibility but requires system configuration changes.

**Market Impact**: The shift to compulsory demat settlement eliminates physical certificate trading, improving settlement efficiency and reducing settlement risks. The reduced market lot of 1 share lowers the entry barrier for retail investors, potentially improving liquidity.

**Compliance Impact**: Members must ensure their operations are fully compliant with demat-only settlement from the effective date, as physical settlements will no longer be permitted. Failure to deliver in demat form will result in auction penalties.
