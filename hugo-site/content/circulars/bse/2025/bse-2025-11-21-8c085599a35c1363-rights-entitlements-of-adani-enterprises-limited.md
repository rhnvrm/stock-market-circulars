## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must inform all clients about commencement of trading in REs, mentioning the ISIN (INE423A20016)
- Trading Members must clarify that REs shall not be mistaken for ordinary shares
- Contract notes/bills for purchase of REs must include a prominent disclaimer stating:

  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced on or before Issue Closing Date shall lapse and be extinguished

## Important Dates

- **November 25, 2025**: Rights Entitlements trading commences; Rights Issue opens
- **November 25 - December 5, 2025**: Trading period for Renunciation of Rights Entitlements
- **December 5, 2025**: Last date for renunciation of REs
- **December 10, 2025**: Rights Issue closes; last date to subscribe
- **After December 10, 2025**: Unsubscribed/unrenounced REs will lapse and be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. Existing shareholders of Adani Enterprises Limited will have the opportunity to trade their Rights Entitlements if they do not wish to subscribe to the rights issue. This provides liquidity and price discovery for the rights.

**Operational Impact**: Trading Members need to ensure proper client communication and include required disclaimers in contract notes. The trade-for-trade settlement and demat-only requirement necessitates careful operational handling.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders must decide whether to: (1) subscribe to the rights issue with application money, (2) renounce and sell their REs in the market between November 25-December 5, or (3) take no action and let REs lapse (resulting in dilution of their shareholding).
