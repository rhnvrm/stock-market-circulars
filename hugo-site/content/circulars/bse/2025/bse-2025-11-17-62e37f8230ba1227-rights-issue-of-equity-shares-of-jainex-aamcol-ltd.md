## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The announcement of a rights issue typically affects the stock price as shares begin trading ex-rights. Existing shareholders will have the opportunity to maintain their proportionate ownership by subscribing to new shares.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders as of the record date will receive rights entitlements in the ratio of 1:2. Non-participation in the rights issue will result in dilution of their shareholding percentage.

**Trading Impact**: From November 20, 2025, all trading will occur on an ex-rights basis, meaning buyers will not be entitled to the rights issue while sellers retain the rights. This may impact short-term price movements and trading volumes.
