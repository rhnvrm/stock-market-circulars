## Regulatory Changes

The price band mechanism is a surveillance tool used by BSE to control excessive volatility in securities. By revising price bands:

- Trading in affected securities will be restricted to the specified percentage movement (up or down) from the previous closing price
- Tighter bands (1-5%) indicate higher concern about price manipulation or excessive speculation
- Wider bands (10-20%) allow greater price discovery while maintaining some control
- This is part of BSE's ongoing surveillance and market integrity measures

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must adhere to the revised price bands for all 36 listed securities
- Orders exceeding the price band limits will be rejected by the trading system
- Members should update their risk management systems and inform clients about the revised bands
- Surveillance department contact: bse.surv@bseindia.com for clarifications
