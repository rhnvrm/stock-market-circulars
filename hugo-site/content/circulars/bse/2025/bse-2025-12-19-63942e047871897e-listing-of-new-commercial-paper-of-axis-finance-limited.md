## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market impact as it represents a routine debt instrument listing. The Commercial Papers provide Axis Finance Limited with short-term financing (approximately 10 months tenure) and offer debt market participants additional investment options in highly-rated instruments. The Rs. 250 crore total issue size (500 units × Rs. 5 lakhs) is standard for corporate Commercial Paper programs. Trading will be limited to institutional investors and high net-worth participants due to the Rs. 5 lakh minimum denomination requirement.
