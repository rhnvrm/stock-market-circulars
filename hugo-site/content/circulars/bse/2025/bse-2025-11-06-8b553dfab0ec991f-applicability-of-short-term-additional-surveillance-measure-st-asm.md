## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The surveillance measure affects 7 new securities and releases 4 securities from restrictions. Traders and investors in these specific stocks will face additional compliance requirements and potential liquidity constraints.

**Trading Impact**: Securities newly added to ST-ASM framework will experience reduced trading activity and increased margin requirements, potentially affecting price discovery and liquidity.
