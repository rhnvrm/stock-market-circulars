Transfer of two investment companies from restricted trade-for-trade segment to regular group trading, allowing for normal trading mechanisms instead of auction-based trading. This change indicates these companies have met the required criteria for regular segment trading.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the effective dates for group changes
- Members must continue to follow trade-for-trade with call auction procedures for Haryana Capfin Limited and Easy Fincorp Limited
- Any clarifications can be sought from Mr. Shyam Bhagirath (Contact: 022-22728013)

## Impact Assessment

The transfer of Kama Holdings Limited and Elcid Investments Limited from trade-for-trade to regular groups will improve liquidity and trading flexibility for these securities. Investors will be able to trade these stocks through normal market mechanisms rather than being restricted to call auction sessions. The continuation of trade-for-trade for Haryana Capfin Limited and Easy Fincorp Limited indicates ongoing surveillance or concerns requiring restricted trading arrangements.
