## Summary

BSE has issued a notice confirming that trading in debentures of Shriram Finance Ltd (Scrip Code 974379) will not be suspended and will continue from November 6, 2025. This follows the company's disclosure that only 114 NCD holders out of 500 total outstanding NCDs have exercised their put option rights for early redemption. Since this represents a partial redemption rather than full redemption, the company requested that trading continue uninterrupted.

## Key Points

- 114 NCDs out of 500 total outstanding NCDs have exercised put option for early redemption
- Partial redemption means 386 NCDs (77.2%) will remain outstanding
- Trading in debentures with Scrip Code 974379 will continue without suspension from November 6, 2025
- This notice supersedes the potential suspension mentioned in previous Exchange Notice No. 20251030-61 dated October 30, 2025
