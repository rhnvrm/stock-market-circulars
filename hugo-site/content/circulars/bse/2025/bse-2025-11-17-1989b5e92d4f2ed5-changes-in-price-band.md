title: Changes in Price Band for 13 Securities Effective November 18, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced revisions to price bands for 13 securities effective November 18, 2025. The price bands vary from 2% to 20%, with the most significant change being Welspun Investments and Commercials Ltd moving to a 20% price band. This surveillance measure restricts the maximum daily price movement allowed for these scrips to help control volatility and protect investor interests.

## Key Points

- 13 scrips will have revised price bands effective November 18, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% (most restrictive for intraday movement) to 20% (least restrictive)
- Three securities have 2% price band: Chandni Machines, Mrugesh Trading, and Soma Textiles & Industries
- Welspun Investments and Commercials Ltd has the widest band at 20%
- Two securities (Jhandewalas Foods and Pioneer Investcorp) have 10% bands
- Remaining eight securities have 5% price bands
- Changes are part of BSE's surveillance measures to manage market volatility

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements price band adjustments as a surveillance mechanism. Price bands limit the percentage change in stock price from the previous closing price during a trading session. Tighter bands (2%-5%) indicate higher regulatory scrutiny and restrict price volatility, while wider bands (10%-20%) allow greater price discovery.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure all trades in the affected scrips comply with the revised price bands from November 18, 2025
- Orders placed beyond the applicable price band limits will be rejected by the trading system
- Members should update their risk management systems and inform clients about the revised price bands
- For clarifications, members may contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 17, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 18, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revised price bands will directly affect trading activity and liquidity in these 13 scrips. Tighter bands (2%-5%) suggest these securities are under enhanced surveillance, potentially due to abnormal price movements or low liquidity. This may reduce speculative trading but could also impact genuine price discovery.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will experience restricted price movement within a single trading session. This protects against extreme volatility but may require multi-day strategies to achieve desired position sizes or exits.

**Specific Concerns**: 
- Securities with 2% bands (Chandni Machines, Mrugesh Trading, Soma Textiles) face the strictest trading restrictions
- Welspun Investments' 20% band, while wider, still indicates it requires surveillance monitoring
- The changes suggest BSE is actively managing volatility concerns across these small and mid-cap securities
