title: GSM Framework Updates - 5 Securities Moving to Higher Surveillance Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of 5 securities to higher stages under the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. Galaxy Agrico Exports Ltd moves to GSM Stage I, while Dhenu Buildcon Infra Ltd advances to Stage III, and three other securities (Bacil Pharma Ltd, Shri Niwas Leasing And Finance Ltd, and Jyotirgamya Enterprises Ltd) move to GSM Stage IV.

## Key Points

- 5 securities are moving to higher GSM surveillance stages
- 1 security moving to GSM Stage I (Galaxy Agrico Exports Ltd)
- 1 security moving to GSM Stage III (Dhenu Buildcon Infra Ltd)
- 3 securities moving to GSM Stage IV (highest surveillance level)
- Securities marked with special symbols may move to lower GSM stages due to ESM or IBC framework inclusion

## Regulatory Changes

Enhanced surveillance measures will apply to the affected securities based on their new GSM stage classifications. Higher GSM stages typically involve stricter trading conditions and monitoring requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must adhere to enhanced surveillance requirements for these securities
- Investors should be aware of the additional surveillance measures when trading these stocks
- Market participants must comply with any additional disclosure or reporting requirements applicable to GSM securities

## Important Dates

Effective date: July 29, 2025 (as per circular date)

## Impact Assessment

The movement to higher GSM stages will result in enhanced monitoring and potentially stricter trading conditions for the affected securities. This may impact liquidity and trading volumes for these stocks as market participants adjust to the new surveillance framework requirements.
