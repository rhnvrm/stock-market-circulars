## Summary

BSE has issued the updated list of securities under the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective October 30, 2025. The circular identifies 15 securities being newly added to the ST-ASM framework, 3 securities moving out of the framework, and provides a consolidated list of all securities currently under surveillance. The ST-ASM framework is applied to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements and involves enhanced monitoring and trading restrictions.

## Key Points

- 15 securities shortlisted for inclusion in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework from October 30, 2025
- 3 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework (Bhagwati Autocast Ltd, John Cockerill India Ltd, Jetking Infotrain Ltd)
- Jetking Infotrain Ltd is moving out due to inclusion in LT-ASM Framework
- No securities are moving to higher or lower stage ASM within the ST-ASM framework
- The framework includes both main board and SME securities
- T+0 scrips are also covered under the framework based on parent company classification
- Consolidated list provides current ST-ASM stage classification for all affected securities

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies additional surveillance measures to securities showing abnormal price movements. Securities under this framework are subject to:

- Enhanced monitoring by the exchange
- Potential trading restrictions based on stage (5/15/30 days)
- Periodic review for continuation, upgrade, downgrade, or removal from the framework

Securities can exit ST-ASM by moving to other surveillance frameworks including LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM (Graded Surveillance Measure), Pledge Framework, or ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure).

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must ensure awareness of securities under ST-ASM and apply appropriate risk management measures
- **Investors**: Should note that securities under ST-ASM may have restricted liquidity and higher volatility
- **Listed Companies**: Companies whose securities are under ST-ASM should ensure timely disclosures and compliance with all regulatory requirements
- All market participants must comply with the additional surveillance requirements applicable to these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 30, 2025 - New ST-ASM list becomes applicable
- **Circular Issue Date**: October 29, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The inclusion of 15 securities in ST-ASM will result in enhanced surveillance and potential trading restrictions, which may reduce liquidity and increase bid-ask spreads for these securities. Investors may experience difficulty in executing large orders.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders of affected securities should expect increased volatility monitoring and potential additional margin requirements. The surveillance measure serves as a warning signal for abnormal price movements.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members will need to update their risk management systems to account for the revised ST-ASM list. SME securities marked with @ symbol require special attention as they may have lower liquidity.

**Positive Aspect**: The exit of 3 securities from ST-ASM indicates improved price stability for those companies, with Jetking Infotrain moving to long-term surveillance framework indicating sustained monitoring needs.
