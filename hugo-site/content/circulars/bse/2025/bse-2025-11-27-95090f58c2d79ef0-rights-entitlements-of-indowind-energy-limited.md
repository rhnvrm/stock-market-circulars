## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects existing shareholders of INDOWIND ENERGY LIMITED who hold rights entitlements and wish to trade them during the renunciation period.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure proper client communication, include mandatory disclaimers in contract notes, and handle T+1 settlement on trade-for-trade basis for this security. The four-day trading window for renunciation provides limited time for shareholders to trade their entitlements before the rights issue closes.
