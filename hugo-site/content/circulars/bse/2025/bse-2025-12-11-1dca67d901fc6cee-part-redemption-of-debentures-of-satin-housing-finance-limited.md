## Impact Assessment

**For Debenture Holders**: Holders as of the record date will receive interest payment and partial principal repayment. The face value reduction to Rs. 50 lakh per debenture reflects the part redemption amount being returned to investors.

**For Trading Members**: Systems and processes must be updated to reflect the reduced face value for trading and settlement from December 16, 2025 onwards. This ensures accurate pricing and settlement calculations post-redemption.
