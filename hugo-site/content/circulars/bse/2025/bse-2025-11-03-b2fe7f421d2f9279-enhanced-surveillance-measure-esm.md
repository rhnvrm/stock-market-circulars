## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework is designed to alert investors about securities showing abnormal price movements or other concerning trading patterns. Securities under ESM are subject to:
- Increased surveillance and monitoring
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Potential trading restrictions depending on ESM stage
- Progressive escalation through higher stages if concerns persist

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must inform clients about ESM status of these securities
- **Investors**: Should exercise additional caution when trading in ESM securities
- **Listed Companies**: Must comply with enhanced disclosure and surveillance requirements
- **Market Participants**: Need to be aware of the ESM status for risk management

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 4, 2025
- **Circular Date**: November 3, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities added to or moved within the ESM framework may experience:
- Reduced liquidity due to investor caution
- Increased volatility monitoring
- Additional compliance burden on trading members
- Potential reputational impact on listed companies

**Market Significance**: The addition of 4 securities and upgrade of 1 security indicates ongoing surveillance activities. The relatively small number suggests targeted action rather than systemic concerns. Companies under ESM need to address underlying issues to avoid further escalation or continued surveillance.

**Investor Implications**: Investors holding or considering these securities should:
- Conduct enhanced due diligence
- Be aware of potentially lower liquidity
- Monitor company disclosures closely
- Understand the reasons for ESM inclusion
