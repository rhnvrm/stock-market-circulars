title: Non Suspension of Trading in Debentures of Shriram Finance Ltd (Scrip Code
  974379)
---

## Summary

BSE has announced that trading in the non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of Shriram Finance Ltd (Scrip Code: 974379) will continue without suspension from November 6, 2025. This follows the company's notification that it received put option exercise notices from holders of 114 NCDs out of 500 total outstanding NCDs. Since this represents a partial redemption rather than full redemption, the company requested that trading not be suspended.

## Key Points

- Shriram Finance Ltd received put option exercise notices for 114 NCDs out of 500 total outstanding NCDs
- Record date for payment of interest and early redemption on exercise of put option is November 6, 2025
- Trading in debentures with Scrip Code 974379 will continue from November 6, 2025 onwards
- Partial redemption means 386 NCDs will remain outstanding after the redemption
- This notice is in continuation to Exchange Notice No. 20251030-61 dated October 30, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are requested to note that debentures with Scrip Code 974379 will continue to trade on and from November 6, 2025
- No suspension of trading will be implemented for these debentures

## Important Dates

- **October 30, 2025**: Original exchange notice issued (Notice No. 20251030-61)
- **November 4, 2025**: Current notice issued
- **November 6, 2025**: Record date for interest payment and early redemption; trading continues from this date

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this circular is minimal as it confirms normal trading operations will continue. The partial redemption of 114 NCDs (22.8% of total outstanding) does not warrant suspension of trading, allowing continued liquidity in the remaining 386 NCDs. This is a routine corporate action that maintains market efficiency while facilitating the put option exercise for a portion of NCD holders. Trading members and investors holding these debentures should note the continuation of trading without interruption.
