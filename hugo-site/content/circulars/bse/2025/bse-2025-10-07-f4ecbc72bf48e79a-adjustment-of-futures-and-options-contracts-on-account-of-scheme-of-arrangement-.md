## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Tata Motors is a major index constituent with significant derivatives trading volume. Early expiry affects all outstanding futures and options positions across all expiries. Traders holding positions beyond October 13, 2025 must close or roll over positions.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to adjust risk management systems, margin calculations, and position monitoring. Price discovery on October 14, 2025 depends on special pre-open session results.

**Investor Impact**: Open interest holders must decide whether to close positions before October 13, 2025 or wait for new contracts post-demerger. Price volatility expected due to corporate action and contract reintroduction.
