## Compliance Requirements

- All allotted shares must comply with the lock-in period ending June 30, 2026
- Shares cannot be transferred or sold until the lock-in period expires
- Depository participants (CDSL and NSDL) must maintain lock-in records as per depository credit confirmation

## Important Dates

- **Listing Date**: December 10, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry Date**: June 30, 2026 (applicable to all allotted shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of 11.4 crore new equity shares represents a substantial increase in the issued capital of Soma Papers & Industries Ltd. This will result in:

- Significant dilution for existing shareholders
- Increased market capitalization
- No immediate impact on trading liquidity due to 18-month lock-in period
- Potential overhang concern when lock-in expires in June 2026

**Liquidity Impact**: With all shares locked-in until June 30, 2026, there will be no immediate change to the free float or trading volumes. However, investors should be aware of potential supply pressure post lock-in expiry.

**Company Impact**: The preferential allotment suggests significant capital raising by the company, likely for expansion, debt reduction, or working capital purposes. The large allotments to a few investors indicate strategic or institutional participation.
