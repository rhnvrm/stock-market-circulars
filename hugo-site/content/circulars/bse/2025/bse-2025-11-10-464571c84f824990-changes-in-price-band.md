title: Revised Price Bands for 18 Securities Effective November 11, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 18 securities effective November 11, 2025, implementing tighter trading restrictions ranging from 2% to 10% price movement limits. These surveillance measures significantly impact trading flexibility and liquidity for the affected scrips.

## Key Points

- 18 securities subject to revised price bands effective November 11, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 10%
- Three securities restricted to 2% band: Maitri Enterprises Ltd, Titan Intech Ltd, Vaxfab Enterprises Ltd
- Four securities restricted to 10% band: Ashnisha Industries Ltd, Betex India Ltd, Ghushine Fintrrade Ocean Ltd, Shahi Shipping Ltd, Transformers and Rectifiers (India) Ltd
- Eleven securities set to 5% price band
- Notice issued under BSE Surveillance department authority

## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions represent enhanced surveillance measures to control volatility and potential manipulation in specific securities. The varying levels (2%, 5%, 10%) indicate different risk assessments for each scrip.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands from November 11, 2025
- All trades in affected securities must comply with new price movement limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect new restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 10, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 11, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Narrow price bands significantly restrict trading flexibility and may reduce liquidity in affected securities. Investors holding these scrips face limited price discovery and potential difficulty in executing large orders.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update risk management systems and alert clients about the enhanced restrictions. The 2% bands on three scrips represent severe trading limitations that may effectively freeze these securities.
