## Impact Assessment

This is a company-specific listing event with limited broader market impact. The listing of partly paid-up shares increases the tradable equity of Suraj Industries Ltd by approximately 2.99 crore shares. The classification in 'X' Group indicates these are newly listed securities. Investors and traders of Suraj Industries should note that these are partly paid shares with future call obligations (Rs. 30/- remaining), which creates a contingent liability for shareholders. The dividend entitlement being proportionate to paid-up value (Rs. 2.50/-) means shareholders will receive reduced dividends until full payment is made.
