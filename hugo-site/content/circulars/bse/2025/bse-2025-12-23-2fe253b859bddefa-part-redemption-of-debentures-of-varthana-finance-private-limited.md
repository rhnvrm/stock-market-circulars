## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. This part redemption affects holders of specific unlisted debentures of Varthana Finance. The reduction in face value from the original to Rs. 25,000 indicates a partial return of principal to investors.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will receive partial redemption proceeds along with interest payment. The reduced face value will proportionally decrease the remaining investment exposure and future interest receipts on these securities.

**Trading Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new face value effective December 26, 2025, two days before the record date, ensuring proper settlement and valuation of positions.
