## Key Points

- Company: Provident Cedar Private Limited
- ISIN: INE0NF907031
- Scrip Code: 974311 (PCPL-17-4-28-PVT)

- Reference: DR-768/2025-2026
- Notice Number: 20251201-14

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a notification of a corporate action (partial redemption) that affects the trading parameters of the debentures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the reduced face value for trading purposes
- All trades in these debentures from December 02, 2025 onwards must reflect the new face value of Rs. 280,223.47 per debenture
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the revised face value

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 01, 2025
- **Effective Date for Trading with Reduced Face Value**: December 02, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market-wide impact as it pertains to debentures of a private limited company. The impact is primarily on:

- **Debenture Holders**: Will receive partial redemption proceeds; their remaining investment will be reflected at the reduced face value
- **Trading Members**: Must update trading systems to reflect the new face value
- **Market Impact**: Minimal, as this affects a specific private placement debt security with likely limited trading activity

The partial redemption reduces the outstanding principal amount per debenture, which is a normal corporate debt management action.
