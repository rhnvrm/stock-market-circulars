## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing with minimal market-wide impact. The listing affects only shareholders of Annvrridhhi Ventures Ltd. who participated in the rights issue. As partly paid-up shares with only 25% paid, shareholders should note their obligation to pay the remaining Rs. 7.50/- per share on future calls by the Board. The 'X' Group classification indicates higher risk/surveillance category. Trading members need to update their systems to recognize the new scrip code and ISIN. The suspension of the temporary ISIN ensures proper tracking and prevents trading confusion between temporary and permanent securities.
