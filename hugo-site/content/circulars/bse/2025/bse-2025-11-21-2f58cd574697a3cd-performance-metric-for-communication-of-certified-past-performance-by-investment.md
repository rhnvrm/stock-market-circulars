---

## Summary

BSE has communicated SEBI Circular no. HO/38/12/11(1)2025-MIRSD-POD/I/73/2025 dated October 30, 2025, which permits Investment Advisers (IAs) to communicate their past performance certified by ICAI/ICMAI members to clients in one-to-one communication. The circular establishes seven standardized performance metrics that IAs may use, along with mandatory accompanying information and disclosure requirements.

## Key Points

- IAs can communicate certified past performance to clients (including prospective clients) in one-to-one communication
- Performance data must be certified by a member of ICAI (Institute of Chartered Accountants of India) or ICMAI (Institute of Cost Accountants of India)
- Seven performance metrics are available: Absolute Returns (INR and %), CAGR, Rolling Returns, Hits/Misses, Performance Charts, and Range of Returns
- IAs may select one or more metrics; disclosure of all metrics is not mandatory
- A single, consistent performance calculation methodology must be adopted for each category of advice
- All communications must include six mandatory information items

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has introduced a standardized framework for Investment Advisers to communicate past performance, which was previously restricted. The key changes include:

1. **Permitted Performance Metrics**: Seven standardized metrics are now defined for communicating past performance
2. **Certification Requirement**: Performance data must be certified by ICAI/ICMAI members
3. **Methodology Consistency**: IAs must adopt a single, consistent performance calculation methodology for each advice category
4. **Transparency Enhancement**: Mandatory accompanying information ensures clients understand the performance data context

## Compliance Requirements

Investment Advisers must ensure the following when communicating past performance:

**Mandatory Accompanying Information:**
1. Name/nature of service/advice/recommendation to which performance relates
2. Applicable time period for the performance
3. Information/details explaining how performance has been calculated
4. Assumptions made during performance calculation
5. Disclaimers specified in the SEBI circular
6. Certification provided by ICAI/ICMAI member for past performance data

**Performance Metrics (Choose one or more):**
1. **Absolute Returns (INR)** - Returns in INR terms for assumed investment amount with time period
2. **Absolute Returns (%)** - Percentage returns with time period
3. **CAGR** - Compounded average annual growth rate with time period
4. **Rolling Returns** - Returns over overlapping periods with time period
5. **Hits/Misses** - Success ratio of calls with time period and number of recommendations
6. **Performance Charts** - Charts showing NAV or price with dates
7. **Range of Returns** - Maximum/minimum returns or categorized performance ranges with time period and number of recommendations

**General Requirements:**
- Adopt single, consistent performance calculation methodology for each advice category
- Ensure certification by ICAI/ICMAI members
- Limit communication to one-to-one basis with clients

## Important Dates

- **October 30, 2025**: SEBI Circular issued
- **November 21, 2025**: BSE communication date
- **Effective Date**: Not specified; appears to be effective immediately

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts:**
- Enhances transparency in Investment Advisory services
- Provides standardized framework for performance communication
- Helps clients make informed decisions based on certified past performance
- Reduces ambiguity in performance reporting

**Operational Impact:**
- Investment Advisers need to establish processes for performance certification by ICAI/ICMAI members
- IAs must document and maintain consistent performance calculation methodologies
- Additional compliance burden for preparing mandatory accompanying information
- Cost implications for obtaining professional certification

**Market Impact:**
- Limited direct market impact as applicable only to Investment Advisers
- May improve investor confidence in advisory services
- Could lead to increased competition among IAs based on transparent performance metrics
- No impact on stock trading or listed securities directly
