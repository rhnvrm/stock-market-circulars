title: 'GSM Framework: Three Securities Moving to Different GSM Stages'

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular announcing the movement of three securities into different stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. Two securities - Mediaone Global Entertainment and Bcl Enterprises Limited - are moving to GSM Stage I, while Lynx Machinery & Commercials Limited is moving to GSM Stage IV, indicating more stringent surveillance.

## Key Points

- Total of 3 securities affected by GSM stage changes
- Mediaone Global Entertainment (Security Code: 503685, ISIN: INE828I01019) moved to GSM Stage I
- Bcl Enterprises Limited (Security Code: 539621, ISIN: INE368E01023) moved to GSM Stage I
- Lynx Machinery & Commercials Limited (Security Code: 505320, ISIN: INE732D01014) moved to GSM Stage IV
- Securities marked with (#) may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM Framework
- Securities marked with ($) may move to lower GSM stages if included in IBC Framework

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities based on various criteria. Movement to higher GSM stages typically involves:
- Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) requirements
- Price bands or trading restrictions
- Periodic call auctions instead of continuous trading
- Enhanced disclosure requirements

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note the GSM stage classifications for affected securities
- Trading members must comply with applicable ASD and trading restriction requirements
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance status when trading these securities

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: December 31, 2025
- Effective implementation as per BSE surveillance framework

## Impact Assessment

The movement of securities into GSM stages indicates regulatory concerns about price volatility, corporate governance, or compliance issues. Stage I placement (for Mediaone and Bcl Enterprises) represents initial surveillance, while Stage IV placement (for Lynx Machinery) indicates more serious concerns with stricter trading restrictions. This may result in reduced liquidity, wider bid-ask spreads, and potential investor caution for these securities.
