title: International Holidays 2026 for Custodian Confirmation of Institutional Trades
---

## Summary

BSE has notified trading members and custodians of 11 international holidays in 2026 on which institutional trades not confirmed by custodians will not attract penalties. This applies to settlements where the custodian confirmation day (T+1) falls on these specified international holidays.

## Key Points

- Penalty waiver applies only when T+1 custodian confirmation day falls on listed international holidays
- Circular continues the existing framework established in 2023 and 2005 notices
- Relates to Delivery versus Payment (DvP) settlement mechanism for institutional trades
- Custodians and trading members are the primary stakeholders affected

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular provides the annual calendar update for existing penalty waiver provisions under the custodian confirmation framework for institutional trades.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and custodians must note the specified international holidays
- No penalties will be imposed for non-confirmation on these dates when they coincide with T+1 settlement day
- Custodians should plan confirmation processes accounting for these holiday dates

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a procedural circular that provides operational clarity for institutional settlement processes.

**Operational Impact:** Low to moderate for custodians and institutional trading members who need to plan their confirmation workflows around these dates. Provides certainty and prevents unintended penalties when international holidays coincide with Indian settlement cycles.

**Target Audience:** Primarily custodians and trading members handling institutional trades under the DvP mechanism.
