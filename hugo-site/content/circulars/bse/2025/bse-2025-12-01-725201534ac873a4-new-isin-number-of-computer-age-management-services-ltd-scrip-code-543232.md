This is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251124-12 dated November 24, 2025. The new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date of December 5, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company Name: Computer Age Management Services Ltd
- Scrip Code: 543232

- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Old Face Value: Rs.10/- per share
- New Face Value: Rs.2/- per share
- Split Ratio: 1:5 (each share of Rs.10 subdivided into 5 shares of Rs.2)
- Demat Request Number: DR-771/2025-2026
- Notice issued by: Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action requiring ISIN number modification in accordance with securities market procedures for stock sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number INE596I01020
- All trades from the ex-date must use the new ISIN
- Depository participants need to ensure proper mapping of old and new ISIN for shareholder accounts
- Systems must reflect the new face value of Rs.2/- per share

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 1, 2025
- **Ex-Date:** December 5, 2025 (new ISIN becomes effective)
- **Reference Circular:** Exchange Notice No. 20251124-12 dated November 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Trading members must update their trading terminals and back-office systems to recognize the new ISIN before the ex-date. Failure to do so could result in trade rejections or settlement issues.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders will see their holdings automatically adjusted in demat accounts - 1 share of Rs.10 will become 5 shares of Rs.2 each. Total investment value remains unchanged. Improved liquidity expected due to lower per-share price.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - requires coordinated updates across trading, clearing, and settlement systems. Depository participants must ensure seamless transition in investor accounts.
