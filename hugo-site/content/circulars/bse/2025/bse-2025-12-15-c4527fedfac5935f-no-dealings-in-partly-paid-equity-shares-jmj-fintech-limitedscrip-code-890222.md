## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that dealings in partly paid equity shares of JMJ Fintech Limited (Scrip Code 890222) must cease from December 19, 2025. This suspension is implemented to facilitate the record date process for identifying shareholders eligible to receive call notices for payment of first and final call money on rights equity shares. The call amount is Rs. 7.35 per share, with Rs. 7 towards face value and Rs. 0.35 towards securities premium.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must immediately cease all dealings in partly paid equity shares of JMJ Fintech Limited from December 19, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: High - Complete suspension of trading in partly paid equity shares prevents any market transactions for affected securities.

**Shareholder Impact**: Shareholders holding partly paid shares must prepare to pay the first and final call money of Rs. 7.35 per share upon receiving call notices. Failure to pay may result in forfeiture of shares.

**Market Operations**: Trading members must update their systems to block trades in scrip code 890222 (partly paid shares) to ensure compliance with the no-dealings restriction.

**Liquidity Impact**: Zero liquidity for partly paid shares from the effective date until conversion to fully paid shares is completed.
