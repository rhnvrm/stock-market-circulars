## Summary

BSE Index Services Pvt Ltd has announced significant methodology changes to the BSE Focused IT Index pursuant to SEBI Circular No.HO/47/15/11(1)2025-MRD-TPD1 dated October 30, 2025. The index will expand from 10 to 14 constituents, with revised selection criteria prioritizing derivative-linked stocks. The constituent weighting methodology has been substantially revised with more stringent capping constraints to improve diversification.

## Key Points

- Top 3 stocks aggregate weight cap reduced from 63% to 45%
