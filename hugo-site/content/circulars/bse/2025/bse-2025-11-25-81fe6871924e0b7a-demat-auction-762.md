## Impact Assessment

**Trading Members:** Members with failed delivery obligations face auction buy-in risk and potential financial penalties. They must arrange funds for auction settlement.

**Investors:** Investors expecting delivery of these securities will receive them through the auction process, though timing may be delayed.

**Market Impact:** Limited overall market impact as demat auctions are routine mechanisms to ensure settlement discipline. Individual scrips may experience temporary price volatility during auction execution.

**Specific Stock Impact:** High-quantity auctions in Murae Organics (999,999 shares), GV Films (700,000 shares), Epuja Spirits (8,215 shares), and Orient Cement (7,280 shares) may see localized price pressure during auction settlement.
