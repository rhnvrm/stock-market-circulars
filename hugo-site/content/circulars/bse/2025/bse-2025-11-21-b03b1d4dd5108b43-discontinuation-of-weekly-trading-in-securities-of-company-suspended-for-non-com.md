title: Discontinuation of Weekly Trading in Securities of Neogem India Ltd
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the discontinuation of weekly trading facility for Neogem India Ltd (Scrip Code: 526195) effective December 09, 2025. The company had been suspended for non-compliance with SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, and was allowed limited trading on a Trade for Trade basis in Z group on the first trading day of every week. With the completion of the mandated six-month period, this limited trading facility will now be discontinued.

## Key Points

- Trading discontinuation applies to Neogem India Ltd (Scrip Code: 526195)
- Previous arrangement allowed Trade for Trade basis trading in Z group only on first trading day of every week
- Discontinuation follows completion of mandated six-month suspension period
- Decision based on SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024
- Original suspension notice was issued on April 21, 2025 (Notice No. 20250421-22)
- Suspension was for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015

## Regulatory Changes

This action implements the provisions of SEBI Master Circular dated November 11, 2024, Chapter-VII(A) regarding Penal Actions for Non-Compliance. The circular establishes Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for suspension and revocation of equity shares for listed entities that fail to comply with SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015. After the six-month limited trading window expires, complete trading discontinuation follows.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific new compliance requirements are imposed by this circular. The discontinuation is a consequence of the company's failure to remedy non-compliance issues during the six-month grace period. Market participants should note that no trading in Neogem India Ltd securities will be permitted after the effective date.

## Important Dates

- **April 21, 2025**: Initial suspension notice issued (Exchange Notice No. 20250421-22)
- **November 21, 2025**: Current notice issued announcing discontinuation
- **December 09, 2025**: Effective date for discontinuation of weekly trading facility

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited market-wide impact as this affects a single suspended company. However, shareholders of Neogem India Ltd face complete inability to trade their holdings after December 09, 2025.

**Shareholder Impact**: High - existing shareholders will have no trading avenue after the discontinuation date, resulting in complete illiquidity of their holdings until the company achieves compliance and is reinstated.

**Operational Impact**: Market participants should update their systems to prevent any trading attempts in this security after the effective date. The Z group Trade for Trade facility will no longer be available.
