## Summary

BSE Surveillance Department sought clarifications from Bajaj Auto Limited (BSE Code: 532977) and Ganesh Housing Limited (Scrip Code: 526367) regarding significant increases in trading volumes of their equity shares. Both companies responded that they have been making timely disclosures as required under SEBI Listing Regulations and confirmed there is no unpublished price sensitive information pending disclosure. The volume increases are market-driven.

## Key Points

- Bajaj Auto clarified volume increase following press release about launch of Riki 3-Wheeler E-Rickshaw on November 26, 2025
- Both companies confirmed compliance with Regulation 30 of SEBI Listing Regulations for timely disclosure of material events
- No unpublished price sensitive information or events due for disclosure
- Volume movements are purely market-driven according to both companies
- Companies remain committed to adherence with disclosure requirements

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must continue making prompt disclosures of all material events within stipulated timelines under Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015
- Companies must disclose any unpublished price sensitive information that may impact operations, performance, or share price/volume

## Important Dates

- November 26, 2025: Bajaj Auto issued press release about Riki E-Rickshaw launch
- November 28, 2025: BSE Surveillance queries issued (ref. L/SURV/ONL/PV/AA/2025-2026/709 for Bajaj Auto and /710 for Ganesh Housing)
- November 28, 2025: Companies submitted clarifications

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine surveillance action where exchanges seek clarification on unusual trading activity. Both companies confirmed proper disclosure practices and absence of undisclosed material information. Bajaj Auto's volume increase appears related to the legitimate news about their new E-Rickshaw product launch. Ganesh Housing attributed volume increase to general market conditions. No corrective actions or sanctions indicated.
