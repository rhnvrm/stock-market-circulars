---

## Summary

Space Incubatrics Technologies Ltd (Scrip Code: 541890) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share with face value of Rs.10/- will be split into 10 equity shares with face value of Re.1/- each. The record date for this corporate action is December 19, 2025, and the new share structure will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Company: Space Incubatrics Technologies Ltd (Scrip Code: 541890)
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares (stock split)
- Split Ratio: 1:10 (One share of Rs.10/- into Ten shares of Re.1/-)
- Record Date: December 19, 2025
- Effective Date: December 19, 2025
- Segment: Equity - Dematerialised Securities (Rolling Settlement)
- Notice Reference: DR-781/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action involving share sub-division that complies with existing securities regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that the existing ISIN No. INE797Z01010 (for Rs.10/- paid up shares) will not be valid for transactions on the Exchange on or after December 19, 2025
- Market participants must await separate notice from BSE announcing the new ISIN number for Re.1/- paid up shares
- All trading and settlement systems must be updated to reflect the new share denomination and ISIN from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **December 8, 2025**: Circular announcement date
- **December 19, 2025**: Record date for sub-division
- **December 19, 2025**: Effective date - old ISIN becomes invalid, new share structure takes effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The 1:10 stock split will increase the number of outstanding shares tenfold while reducing the per-share price proportionally. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors without changing the company's market capitalization.

**Operational Impact**: 
- Shareholders will receive 10 shares of Re.1/- each for every 1 share of Rs.10/- held as on record date
- The stock price will adjust to approximately one-tenth of the pre-split price
- Trading participants must ensure systems are updated with new ISIN before December 19, 2025
- Demat accounts will reflect the increased number of shares post-split

**Investor Impact**: Neutral to positive - while shareholder value remains unchanged proportionally, increased liquidity and lower absolute share price may attract more retail participation.
