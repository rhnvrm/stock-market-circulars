title: Performance Metric for Communication of Certified Past Performance by Investment
  Advisers
---

## Summary

BSE has notified Investment Advisers (IAs) about SEBI Circular no. HO/38/12/11(1)2025-MIRSD-POD/I/73/2025 dated October 30, 2025, which permits IAs to communicate their past performance certified by ICAI/ICMAI members to clients in one-to-one communication. The circular establishes seven performance metrics that IAs may use, along with mandatory disclosure requirements to ensure transparency and uniformity.

## Key Points

- Investment Advisers can communicate certified past performance to clients (including prospective clients) in one-to-one communication
- Performance data must be certified by a member of ICAI (Institute of Chartered Accountants of India) or ICMAI (Institute of Cost Accountants of India)
- Seven performance metrics are available: Absolute Returns (INR and %), CAGR, Rolling Returns, Hits/Misses, Performance Charts, and Range of Returns
- IAs may select one or more metrics from the list; disclosure of all metrics is not mandatory
- Investment Advisers must adopt a single, consistent performance calculation methodology for each category of advice or recommendation
- All performance communications must include six specific pieces of mandatory information

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has introduced a standardized framework for Investment Advisers to communicate past performance data. Previously, such communications were restricted. The new framework permits certified past performance communication through specified performance metrics:

1. **Absolute Returns (INR terms)** - Returns for assumed investment amount over specified time period
2. **Absolute Returns (%)** - Percentage returns over specified time period
3. **CAGR** - Compounded average annual growth rate
4. **Rolling Returns** - Returns over overlapping time periods within total timeframe
5. **Hits/Misses** - Success ratios represented as:
   - Ratio of successful to unsuccessful calls
   - Ratio of successful to total calls
   - Number of successful calls as percentage of total calls
6. **Performance Charts** - Charts showing NAV or price of recommended securities
7. **Range of Returns** - Maximum/minimum returns or categorization across performance ranges

## Compliance Requirements

Investment Advisers must ensure all performance communications include:

1. Name/nature of service/advice/recommendation of IA
2. Applicable time period for the performance
3. Information/details explaining performance calculation methodology
4. Assumptions made during performance calculation
5. Disclaimers specified in SEBI circular
6. Certification provided by ICAI/ICMAI member for past performance data

**Additional Requirements:**
- Each performance metric must include minimum mandatory information (time period in days/months/years)
- For Hits/Misses and Range of Returns metrics, number of recommendations must also be disclosed
- For Performance Charts, specific dates must be included
- Investment Advisers must adopt a single, consistent performance calculation methodology at all times for each category of advice or recommendation
- Enhanced transparency and uniformity must be maintained

## Important Dates

- **October 30, 2025** - Date of original SEBI Circular no. HO/38/12/11(1)2025-MIRSD-POD/I/73/2025
- **November 21, 2025** - BSE notification date
- **Effective Immediately** - Investment Advisers may begin communicating certified past performance following the prescribed framework

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts:**
- Enables Investment Advisers to showcase track record through certified performance data
- Provides standardized framework ensuring consistency and comparability
- Enhances transparency in IA-client relationships
- Allows prospective clients to make informed decisions based on certified past performance
- Flexibility to choose relevant metrics based on advisory service type

**Operational Impact:**
- Investment Advisers need to engage ICAI/ICMAI members for certification of past performance
- Requires development of consistent performance calculation methodologies
- Need to maintain documentation showing assumptions and calculation methods
- Additional compliance burden to ensure all six mandatory disclosures accompany performance communications
- One-to-one communication limitation means mass marketing of performance remains restricted

**Market Impact:**
- Limited direct market impact as this affects only Investment Advisers and their client communications
- May increase competition among IAs based on transparent, certified performance metrics
- Could enhance investor confidence in advisory services sector
