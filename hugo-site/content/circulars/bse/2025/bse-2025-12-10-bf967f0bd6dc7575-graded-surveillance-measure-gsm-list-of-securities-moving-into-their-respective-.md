## Impact Assessment

The placement of securities in GSM stages indicates regulatory concerns about their trading behavior, liquidity, or compliance status. Higher GSM stages typically result in reduced trading activity, increased margin requirements, and lower investor confidence. Investors holding these securities should exercise heightened caution and stay updated on company developments. Companies may face reputational impact and need to address underlying issues to exit GSM surveillance.
