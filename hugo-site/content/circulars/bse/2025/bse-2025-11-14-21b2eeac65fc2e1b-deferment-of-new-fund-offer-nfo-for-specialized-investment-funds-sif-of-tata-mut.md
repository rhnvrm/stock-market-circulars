## Summary

BSE has notified members that TATA Mutual Fund has deferred the New Fund Offer (NFO) of its Titanium Hybrid Long-Short Fund, a Specialized Investment Fund (SIF), on the BSE StAR MF Platform. The deferment is effective immediately and will remain until further instructions are provided by TATA Mutual Fund.

## Key Points

- TATA Mutual Fund's Titanium Hybrid Long-Short Fund NFO has been deferred
- The fund is categorized as a Specialized Investment Fund (SIF)
- Deferment is until further notice from TATA Mutual Fund
- This follows previous notice 20251113-64 dated November 13, 2025, which introduced the SIF on BSE StAR MF Platform
- Notice issued by VP - Mutual Fund Arunkumar Ganesan and AVP - Mutual Fund Mahesh Tare

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational update regarding the postponement of a previously announced NFO.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. Members and investors should note that the NFO will not proceed as originally scheduled and should await further communication from TATA Mutual Fund regarding revised timelines.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 14, 2025
- **Original Introduction Notice**: November 13, 2025 (Notice no. 20251113-64)
- **NFO Effective Date**: Deferred until further notice

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this deferment is limited and primarily affects:

- Investors who were planning to participate in the Titanium Hybrid Long-Short Fund NFO
- BSE StAR MF Platform distributors and intermediaries who need to update their systems and communications
- TATA Mutual Fund's product launch timeline

There is no broader market impact, and the deferment does not affect existing TATA Mutual Fund schemes or other NFOs on the BSE StAR MF Platform. Investors interested in this fund should monitor future announcements for revised launch dates.
