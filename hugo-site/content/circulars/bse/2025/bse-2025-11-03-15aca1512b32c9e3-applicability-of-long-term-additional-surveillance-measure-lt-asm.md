## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective November 04, 2025. Two securities are being newly included in LT-ASM (FONE4 Communications and Jattashankar Industries), one security (Megasoft Ltd) is being directly placed in Stage IV LT-ASM, and two securities (GTN Textiles and Lancer Container Lines) are being moved out of LT-ASM due to inclusion in the ESM Framework.

## Key Points

- 2 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: FONE4 Communications (India) Limited (543521) and Jattashankar Industries Ltd (514318)
- 1 security (Megasoft Ltd - 532408) directly placed in Stage IV Long Term ASM Framework
- 2 securities moved out of LT-ASM: GTN Textiles Ltd and Lancer Container Lines Ltd (both moved to ESM Framework)
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages within LT-ASM framework
- Consolidated list provided showing securities across all ASM stages (I through IV)
- Changes effective from November 04, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework applies additional surveillance measures to securities exhibiting certain characteristics over extended periods. Securities under LT-ASM face:
- Enhanced disclosure requirements
- Trading restrictions including price bands
- Additional margin requirements
- Increased monitoring by the exchange

Securities can be placed directly into higher stages (like Stage IV for Megasoft) or move between stages based on surveillance parameters. Securities may exit LT-ASM when included in other frameworks like Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, or IBC.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable margins and trading restrictions for securities under LT-ASM
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance measures applicable to these securities
- Members must monitor the ASM stage of securities as it determines the level of restrictions
- Special attention required for T+0 scrips marked with tilde (~) that are in LT-ASM based on parent company criteria

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 04, 2025 - All changes to LT-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited impact on overall market as only 5 securities are affected by changes. However, for investors and traders in these specific stocks, the impact is significant.

**Liquidity Impact**: Securities newly added to LT-ASM will likely experience reduced liquidity due to enhanced surveillance measures and additional margin requirements. The two securities moving to ESM Framework face even stricter restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Holders of affected securities should be aware of increased trading costs and restrictions. New entries to LT-ASM indicate exchange concerns about price volatility or other risk factors in these securities.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems and risk management frameworks to reflect the new ASM classifications for affected securities.
