## Important Dates

- **Prospectus Date**: November 7, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of over 617 crore equity shares significantly expands the company's public float. However, substantial lock-in provisions will limit immediate trading liquidity, with large tranches locked until May 2026 and May 2027.

**Liquidity Impact**: Approximately 44.74 crore shares (7.2% of total) are not under lock-in and available for immediate trading. The staggered lock-in expiry dates (December 2025, February 2026, May 2026, and May 2027) will result in phased liquidity increases.

**Investor Considerations**: 
- The 18-month lock-in period for certain tranches (totaling approximately 5.26 crore shares) indicates long-term commitment from promoters/investors
- ESOP shares exemption enhances employee liquidity while maintaining regulatory compliance
- Physical shares represent a small portion (approximately 0.6%) of total equity, indicating strong dematerialization compliance
