title: Two-Factor Authentication Implementation on IBBS Platform - Security Questions
  Option Removal
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the removal of "Security Questions" as a two-factor authentication option for the internet-based Book Building Software (iBBS) platform. Effective September 26, 2025, users will only have Google Authentication and OTP (One Time Password) options available for 2FA login.

## Key Points

- Two-factor authentication has been mandatory on iBBS platform since May 2019
- Currently three 2FA options available: Google Authentication, Security Questions, and OTP
- Security Questions option will be discontinued from September 26, 2025
- Only Google Authentication and OTP will remain as 2FA options
- Users must update mobile numbers and email addresses in iBBS User Master to receive OTP

## Regulatory Changes

Removal of Security Questions as a valid two-factor authentication method for iBBS platform access, reducing available authentication options from three to two.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members, Self-Certified Syndicate Banks (SCSBs), Registrar and Transfer Agents, Depository Participants and other intermediaries must ensure mobile numbers and email addresses are updated in iBBS User Master
- Users must configure either Google Authentication or OTP for continued platform access
- Contact BSE at ibbs.ops@bseindia.com or listing.sales@bseindia.com for clarifications

## Important Dates

- **September 26, 2025**: Last day Security Questions authentication will be available
- **September 27, 2025**: Only Google Authentication and OTP options will be available for iBBS platform login

## Impact Assessment

Moderate operational impact requiring users to update contact information and potentially reconfigure authentication methods. The change enhances security by removing a potentially less secure authentication option while maintaining convenient alternatives. Sufficient notice period provided for smooth transition.
