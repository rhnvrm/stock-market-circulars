- **Trading Commencement**: December 5, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of approximately 18.05 crore shares represents significant capital infusion through preferential allotment. The dilution impact on existing shareholders depends on the pre-issue share capital.

**Liquidity Impact**: While shares are listed from December 5, 2025, the complete lock-in until June 8, 2026 means these shares cannot be traded for approximately 6 months, limiting immediate liquidity impact.

**Investor Consideration**: Non-promoter allotment at Rs. 18/- per share indicates institutional or strategic investor participation. Investors should monitor the company's utilization of funds and the potential supply pressure post lock-in expiry in June 2026.
