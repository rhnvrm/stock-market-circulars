## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- High impact event due to major corporate restructuring of a listed company
- Trading restrictions apply with transfer to T Group (Trade-to-Trade segment), limiting intraday trading
- Call auction mechanism will determine opening price on ex-date, potentially causing price discovery volatility
- Creation of two new listed entities will provide pure-play exposure to chemicals and rayon businesses separately

**Shareholder Impact:**
- Shareholders will hold three securities post-demerger instead of one
- No dilution of economic interest as share exchange ratio is 1:1 for both entities
- Potential for enhanced value unlock through separation of distinct business verticals
- Increased portfolio diversification with exposure to two independent companies

**Operational Impact:**
- Demerged company (DCM Shriram Industries) will continue as a separate entity after transferring Chemical and Rayon undertakings
- DCM Shriram Fine Chemicals Ltd. will operate the chemical business independently
- DCM Shriram International Ltd. will operate the rayon business independently
- Both resulting companies will require separate tracking and monitoring by investors and analysts
