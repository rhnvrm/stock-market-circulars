## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of preferentially allotted shares representing capital raising by Baroda Extrusion Ltd. The lock-in periods ensure that a significant portion of the new shares (100% of allotment) will not immediately impact market liquidity.

**Trading Impact**: Minimal immediate impact as all shares are under lock-in. The shares will gradually become tradeable starting June 14, 2026.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution from the preferential allotment. The pari-passu ranking ensures equal rights for new and existing shareholders in terms of dividends and voting.
