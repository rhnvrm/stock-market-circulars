## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of this specific private placement debenture series. The trading suspension is procedural and necessary to determine eligible debenture holders for the redemption and interest payment.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will not be able to trade these securities from December 5, 2025. Investors who hold the debentures as of the record date (December 6, 2025) will receive the redemption amount and final interest payment.
