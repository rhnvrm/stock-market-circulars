## Impact Assessment

This preferential allotment represents a significant capital raise for IRB InvIT Fund, adding approximately Rs. 1,005 crore (15.97 crore units × Rs. 62.95) to the fund.

Market impact is expected to be moderate as the units enter trading, with liquidity considerations due to substantial lock-in volumes.
