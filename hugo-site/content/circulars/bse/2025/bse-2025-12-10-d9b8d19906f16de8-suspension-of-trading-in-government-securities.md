The suspension is due to the T-bill reaching its redemption/maturity date on December 15, 2025. Trading members are advised to cease all transactions in this security from the specified date.

## Key Points

- Reference number: DR-775/2025-2026

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this circular is limited and routine in nature. It affects only a single government security reaching its natural maturity date. Trading members holding positions in this T-bill would have been aware of the maturity date and should have planned accordingly. This is standard market practice for debt securities approaching redemption, ensuring orderly settlement and preventing trading in securities that are about to cease to exist. No systemic market impact is expected.
