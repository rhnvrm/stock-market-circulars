title: Updated Operational Guidelines for participation on BSEBOND (EBP platform of
  BSE)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updated operational guidelines for participation on BSEBOND (BSE's Electronic Book Provider platform) effective November 17, 2025. The revisions implement changes mandated by SEBI circular SEBI/HO/DDHS/DDHS-PoD-1/P/CIR/2025/0000000073 dated May 16, 2025, which reviewed EBP platform provisions to increase efficacy and utility. The updated guidelines introduce changes to anchor investor allocation mechanisms, pro-rata allotment processes, and expand platform access to additional instruments including securitized debt instruments, security receipts, commercial papers, certificates of deposit, and units of REITs, SM REITs and InvITs.

## Key Points

- Anchor investor allocation quantum based on instrument rating, to be confirmed on BSEBOND portal before 5 PM on T-1
- Unconfirmed anchor investor amounts will be added back to base issue size
- Pro-rata allotment introduced for multiple bids at cut-off coupon/price/spread
- Platform access extended to private placement of securitized debt instruments and security receipts
- Platform access extended to commercial papers (CPs) and certificates of deposit (CDs) on optional basis
- REITs, SM REITs and InvITs can now access EBP platform for private placement of units
- Revisions align with changes to Chapter VI and Chapter VII of the Operational Circular for Issue and Listing of Non-convertible Securities
- Guidelines applicable to all registered participants and market intermediaries accessing BSEBOND

## Regulatory Changes

The updated guidelines implement SEBI's directive to review and enhance the Electronic Book Provider platform framework. Key regulatory changes include:

1. **Anchor Investor Allocation Mechanism**: The quantum of allocation to anchor investors is now explicitly linked to the rating of the instrument, requiring confirmation on the BSEBOND portal by 5 PM on T-1 day

2. **Reallocation Process**: Any amount not confirmed by anchor investors will be automatically added back to the base issue size, improving capital allocation efficiency

3. **Pro-rata Allotment**: Introduction of systematic pro-rata basis allotment when multiple bids exist at cut-off coupon/price/spread (detailed illustration provided in Annexure-B)

4. **Expanded Instrument Coverage**: Platform access extended beyond mandatory debt securities and NCRPS to include:
   - Securitized debt instruments (optional)
   - Security receipts (optional)
   - Commercial papers (optional)
   - Certificates of deposit (optional)
   - Units of REITs, SM REITs and InvITs (optional)

5. **Regulatory Framework**: Updates to Chapter VI and Chapter VII of the Operational Circular for Issue and Listing of Non-convertible Securities, Securitized Debt Instruments, Security Receipts, Municipal Debt Securities and Commercial Paper
