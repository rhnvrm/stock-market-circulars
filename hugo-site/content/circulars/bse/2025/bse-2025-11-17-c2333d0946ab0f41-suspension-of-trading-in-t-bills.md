Trading members are advised not to deal in these securities from the effective date as they are scheduled to mature on the redemption date.

- **Trading Suspension Effective Date**: November 18, 2025
- **Redemption Date**: Not explicitly stated, but implied to be on or shortly after November 18, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited and routine. The suspension affects only the specific securities listed and is a standard procedure for maturing debt instruments. Holders of these securities will receive redemption proceeds as per schedule.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to block trading in these three securities. Investors holding these instruments should be aware that they cannot be traded and will be redeemed at maturity value.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these securities will not be able to sell them on the exchange from November 18, 2025, but will receive redemption proceeds at maturity. This is expected and part of the normal lifecycle of T-bills and government securities.
