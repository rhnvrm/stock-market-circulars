- Standard trading and settlement procedures apply to these newly listed shares

- **Listing and Trading Commencement**: December 11, 2025 (Thursday)
- **Lock-in Period**: Not applicable (NA) for all companies

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. ESOP share listings are routine corporate actions with limited market impact as quantities are typically small relative to total outstanding shares.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in floating stock for each company. The largest issuances are from Yes Bank (1.06 million shares) and Suzlon Energy (590,000 shares), which represent fractional increases to their existing share base.

**Investor Impact**: No direct impact on existing shareholders. ESOP shares are already accounted for in diluted earnings calculations. These shares may be sold by employees in the market over time.

**Trading Impact**: No lock-in restrictions mean shares are immediately available for trading, though employees may hold for tax or personal investment reasons.
