## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The combined sub-division and bonus issue will result in shareholders holding 4 times the number of shares (2x from split, 2x from bonus) at ₹5 face value compared to original ₹10 shares. This significantly increases liquidity and reduces per-share price, potentially making the stock more accessible to retail investors.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their shareholding increase from 1 share of ₹10 to 4 shares of ₹5 (2 from split + 2 from bonus), maintaining proportional ownership while improving trading flexibility.

**Operational Impact**: Total issued capital increases from ₹83,10,536 to ₹8,31,05,360 in absolute terms. New ISIN will be assigned. Trading systems and depository participants must update records to reflect new share structure and distinctive number ranges.
