## Summary

BSE has issued a notice for suspension of trading in securities of Vasudhagama Enterprises Ltd (Scrip Code: 539291) effective December 1, 2025, due to non-compliance with Regulation 27(2) of SEBI LODR Regulations 2015 for two consecutive quarters (March 2025 and June 2025). The suspension includes freezing of entire promoter shareholding and all securities in promoter demat accounts during the suspension period.

## Key Points

- Trading in Vasudhagama Enterprises Ltd will be suspended from December 1, 2025
- Non-compliance relates to failure to file financial results for March 2025 and June 2025 quarters under Regulation 27(2)
- Entire promoter shareholding and all promoter demat account securities will be frozen during suspension
- Company has until November 26, 2025 to comply and avoid suspension
- After 15 days of suspension, trading will be allowed on Trade for Trade basis in Z group only on first trading day of every week for six months
- Suspension is based on SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024

## Regulatory Changes

This notice implements the Standard Operating Procedure for suspension and revocation of trading as per SEBI's penal framework for non-compliance with SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- **For Vasudhagama Enterprises Ltd**: Must comply with all provisions of SEBI LODR Regulations 2015 to the satisfaction of BSE and pay applicable fines
- **For Market Participants**: Take note of the trading restrictions and comply with the modified trading mechanism post-suspension
- **For Promoters**: Frozen shareholding will remain locked during suspension period

## Important Dates

- **October 29, 2025**: Notice issued
- **November 26, 2025**: Deadline for company to comply and avoid suspension
- **December 1, 2025**: Effective date of trading suspension (30 days from notice)
- **December 16, 2025 onwards**: Trade for Trade mechanism begins (15 days after suspension, first trading day of each week for 6 months)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Complete suspension of trading affects liquidity and investor ability to exit positions. Shift to Z group with Trade for Trade mechanism significantly restricts trading activity.

**Investor Impact**: High - Existing shareholders will face complete trading halt unless company complies by November 26, 2025. Promoter holdings completely frozen.

**Company Impact**: Severe - Trading suspension damages company reputation, restricts capital raising ability, and creates additional compliance burden with fines. Revocation requires meeting all compliance norms and procedures.
