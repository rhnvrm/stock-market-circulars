title: Update on Additional Margin in All Variants of Gold and Silver
---

## Summary

Indian Clearing Corporation Limited (ICCL) has issued a modification to its earlier circular dated October 22, 2025, updating additional margin requirements for gold and silver commodity derivatives. The key changes include removing the 1% additional margin from November 2025 expiry contracts (GOLD and GOLDM) once they enter the tender period starting October 30, 2025, and simultaneously applying this 1% additional margin to December 2025 expiry contracts. Similar treatment will apply to silver contracts on a rolling basis.

## Key Points

- 1% additional margin on GOLD and GOLDM November 2025 expiry contracts will be removed from beginning of day (BOD) October 30, 2025
- 1% additional margin will be applied to GOLD and GOLDM December 2025 expiry contracts from BOD October 30, 2025
- Additional margin on near month contracts (not in tender period) will continue until further notice
- For silver contracts, additional margin will be removed when contracts enter tender period and applied to next expiring contracts
- "Near Month" for this circular means near month contract expiry not in tender period
- Circular issued by Chief Risk Officer Sushant Majhi

## Regulatory Changes

This circular modifies ICCL circular no. 20251022-1 dated October 22, 2025. The changes represent a periodic review of risk management measures to mitigate systemic risk in commodity derivatives trading. The modification implements a rolling margin structure that shifts additional margin requirements from expiring contracts entering tender period to the next available near month contracts.

## Compliance Requirements

- All clearing members and participants must adjust their margin calculations accordingly from BOD October 30, 2025
- Members must ensure adequate margin coverage for December 2025 gold contracts (GOLD and GOLDM)
- Members should monitor silver contract expiries for similar rolling margin applications
- Position management and risk monitoring should account for the margin changes

## Important Dates

- **October 29, 2025**: Circular notice date
- **October 30, 2025 (BOD)**: Effective date for margin changes
  - Removal of 1% additional margin on GOLD and GOLDM November 2025 expiry
  - Application of 1% additional margin on GOLD and GOLDM December 2025 expiry
- **November 5, 2025**: Expiry date for GOLD and GOLDM November contracts
- **December 5, 2025**: Expiry date for GOLD and GOLDM December contracts

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects commodity derivatives traders with positions in gold and silver contracts. The margin shift may influence trading strategies around contract rollovers.

**Operational Impact**: Clearing members need to update their margin monitoring systems and ensure clients maintain adequate margins for December 2025 contracts. The 1% additional margin requirement continues on a rolling basis, requiring ongoing position management.

**Risk Management**: The measure is part of ICCL's periodic review to ensure adequate risk coverage and mitigate systemic risk in commodity derivatives, particularly during tender period transitions.
