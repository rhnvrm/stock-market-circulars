## Impact Assessment

The impact of this listing is minimal as it involves only 883 equity shares being released from abeyance. Given Tata Consumer Products Limited's substantial market capitalization and existing equity base, this small quantity of shares is unlikely to have any material impact on trading volumes, liquidity, or stock price. This is a routine administrative listing arising from completion of scheme-related formalities.
