## Summary

BSE has announced mandatory adjustments to all Futures and Options contracts of Adani Enterprises Ltd (Scrip Code: 512599, Derivatives Asset Code: ADEL) following the company's rights issue announcement. The rights issue is in the ratio of 3:25 (3 equity shares for every 25 held) at an issue price of Rs. 1800 per share. Adjustments will be made on November 14, 2025 (end of day), with the ex-date being November 17, 2025. The adjustment factor of 0.970403 will be applied to modify strike prices and market lots for all existing contracts.

## Key Points

- Rights issue ratio: 3:25 (3 new shares for every 25 existing shares)
- Issue price: Rs. 1800 per equity share
- Record date: November 17, 2025 (ex-date)
- Adjustment date: November 14, 2025 (end of day)

- Strike prices will be multiplied by adjustment factor 0.970403
- Market lot will increase from 300 to 309 contracts
- Applies to all available F&O contracts on ADEL

## Regulatory Changes

This adjustment is being made in pursuance of SEBI guidelines for adjustment of Futures & Options contracts on announcement of corporate actions. The methodology follows SEBI's prescribed formula for rights issue adjustments:

- Adjustment Factor = (P-E)/P, where P is spot price on last cum date and E is benefits per share
- Benefits per share = (P-S) × A / (A+B), where S is issue price, A is rights entitlement, and B is existing shares

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Download the revised contract master file on the adjustment day (November 14, 2025)
- Update systems with new strike prices and market lots
- Inform clients holding positions in ADEL F&O contracts about the adjustments
- Contact designated Relationship Managers for clarifications
- Ensure trading systems reflect revised contract specifications before market opens on November 17, 2025

**Contract Adjustments Required:**
- All options contracts: Strike prices to be adjusted by multiplying by 0.970403
- All options contracts: Market lot to change from 300 to 309
- All futures contracts: Futures price to be adjusted by multiplying by 0.970403
- All futures contracts: Market lot to change from 300 to 309

## Important Dates

- **November 14, 2025**: Adjustments to be made (end of day)
- **November 17, 2025**: Ex-date for rights issue; Record date for shareholder eligibility

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- All existing F&O positions in Adani Enterprises Ltd will be automatically adjusted
- Traders with open positions need to account for revised strike prices and lot sizes
- Example: An existing 1900 strike call option will become 1843.75 strike
- Market lot increase from 300 to 309 contracts affects position sizing and margin requirements

**Operational Impact:**
- High impact on derivatives traders with active positions in ADANIENT
- Margin requirements may change due to adjusted market lot size
- Potential for confusion if traders are unaware of adjustments
- Risk management systems need to be updated with new contract parameters

**Financial Impact:**
- The adjustment factor of 0.970403 reflects a dilution effect of approximately 2.96%
- Benefits per share of Rs. 73.61 represents the theoretical value of the rights entitlement
- Position values will be adjusted proportionally to maintain fair value post-corporate action
