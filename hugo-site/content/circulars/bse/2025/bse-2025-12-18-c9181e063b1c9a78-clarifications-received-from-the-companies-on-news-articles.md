  Ex-Promoter
---

## Summary

Sammaan Capital Limited (formerly Indiabulls Housing Finance Limited) issued a clarification regarding media reports about Delhi Police filing an FIR against its ex-promoter Sameer Gehlaut. The company emphasized that Gehlaut ceased to be a promoter in February 2023, exited the board in March 2022, and completely divested his shareholding by September 2023. The FIR pertains to alleged fraud and criminal conspiracy involving transactions between Gehlaut and five corporate groups (Americorp, Reliance ADAG, DLF Group, Vatika Group, and Chordia Group). The company clarified it has no current relation with Gehlaut.

## Key Points

- FIR relates to alleged fraud and criminal conspiracy in quid pro quo transactions between Gehlaut and five corporate groups: Americorp, Reliance ADAG, DLF Group, Vatika Group, and Chordia Group
- Enforcement Directorate informed Delhi Police EOW about the alleged fraud, leading to FIR registration
- CBI, ED, SFIO and SEBI held meeting to examine whether SIT formation is required; decision on SIT could not be taken

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - While the FIR against ex-promoter could create short-term negative sentiment (stock fell 7% from day's high on news), the company's clear separation from Gehlaut since 2023 limits direct impact. Investors should note the company has no current association with the individual under investigation.

**Operational Impact**: Low - No operational impact as the investigation pertains to alleged activities of an ex-promoter who has completely exited the company (as director, promoter, and shareholder) over two years ago.

**Legal Impact**: Low for company - Investigations are directed at Sameer Gehlaut and five corporate groups, not at Sammaan Capital Limited. However, legacy association and previous company name (Indiabulls Housing Finance) may continue to draw media attention.

**Reputational Impact**: Medium - Despite clear separation, continued media coverage of investigations involving ex-promoter may affect company reputation in short term, requiring ongoing proactive disclosure.
