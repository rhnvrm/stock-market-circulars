## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this concerns privately placed debentures of a private limited company. Only debenture holders as of the record date (December 21, 2025) will be eligible for the part redemption proceeds and interest payment. Trading Members handling these securities need to ensure their systems reflect the reduced face value from December 19, 2025. The face value reduction indicates partial capital return to debenture holders while the securities remain listed and tradeable.
