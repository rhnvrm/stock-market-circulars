## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a periodic index reconstitution based on BSE's standard review process for maintaining index composition aligned with market capitalization, liquidity, and other eligibility criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- Index fund managers and ETF providers tracking these indices must rebalance their portfolios to reflect the new composition
- Portfolio rebalancing should be completed by the effective dates to maintain index tracking accuracy
- Market participants are advised to contact bseindex@bseindia.com for additional queries regarding the reconstitution

## Important Dates

- **November 21, 2025**: Announcement date
- **December 22, 2025**: Effective date for changes to BSE SENSEX, BSE 100, BSE SENSEX 50, and BSE SENSEX Next 50
- **December 26, 2025**: Effective date for changes to BSE BANKEX
- Changes will be implemented at market open on respective dates

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High impact expected due to inclusion of Interglobe Aviation in the benchmark SENSEX index and multiple changes across other indices. Passive funds tracking these indices will need to buy newly added stocks and sell deleted ones, potentially creating significant trading volumes in affected securities around the effective dates.

**Sectoral Impact**: Aviation sector gains representation in SENSEX through Interglobe Aviation. Banking sector sees enhanced representation in BANKEX with four additions. The removal of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles from SENSEX reduces auto sector weightage.

**Investor Impact**: Index fund investors will see automatic portfolio adjustments. Active investors may anticipate price movements in affected stocks due to forced buying/selling by index funds. Historical patterns show stocks being added to indices typically experience price increases leading up to the effective date.
