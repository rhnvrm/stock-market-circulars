## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine commercial paper listing that adds short-term debt instruments to the BSE Debt segment. The issue size of Rs. 50 crores is moderate and typical for corporate commercial paper programs.

**Investor Impact**: Provides institutional and high-net-worth investors with an additional A1+ rated short-term investment option with approximately 6-month tenure. The discount issue price of Rs. 478,933.50 against face value of Rs. 500,000 offers yield to maturity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members gain access to trade ECL Finance commercial paper on the debt platform with standard settlement procedures through ICICI Bank as the paying agent. The Rs. 5 Lakhs minimum trading denomination limits participation to institutional and qualified investors.
