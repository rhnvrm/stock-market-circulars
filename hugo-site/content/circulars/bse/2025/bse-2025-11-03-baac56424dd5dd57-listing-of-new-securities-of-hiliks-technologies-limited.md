## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this is a routine listing notification for a single company's preferential issue. The addition of 5,00,000 shares represents capital raised through warrant conversion. Lock-in provisions ensure these shares remain with current holders until May 2026, preventing immediate market dilution. Trading members can facilitate transactions in these securities from November 4, 2025, subject to lock-in restrictions.
