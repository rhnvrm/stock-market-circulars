## Regulatory Changes

These securities will be subject to the GSM framework requirements at their respective stages, which includes:
- Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) requirements that increase with each stage
- Trading only in Trade-for-Trade (TFT) segment
- Price bands as applicable
- Additional disclosures and monitoring

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors trading in these securities must be aware of the GSM stage restrictions
- Brokers must collect additional margins as per GSM framework requirements
- Companies must comply with enhanced disclosure requirements under surveillance
- Settlement will be on T+1 basis with no intraday netting

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 29, 2025 (date of circular issuance)
- The GSM stage movement would be effective from the next trading session

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The movement to higher GSM stages indicates these securities have exhibited characteristics warranting increased surveillance. This may reduce liquidity and increase trading costs due to higher margin requirements.

**Trading Impact**: Investors in these securities will face additional margin requirements and trading restrictions. Stage III securities face the highest level of surveillance with significant ASD requirements.

**Investor Alert**: The GSM framework serves as a cautionary mechanism for investors. Securities in higher GSM stages require careful evaluation before investment due to underlying concerns about price volatility or corporate governance issues.
