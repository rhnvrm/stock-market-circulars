title: Further Extension of Timeline for Mandatory Implementation of T+0 Settlement
  Systems by Qualified Stock Brokers
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued a further extension of the timeline for Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs) to implement necessary systems and processes for enabling investor participation in the optional T+0 settlement cycle. The deadline, previously extended to November 1, 2025, has been postponed indefinitely with further guidance to be provided at a later date. This extension follows challenges highlighted by QSBs in ensuring timely system readiness.

## Key Points

- Timeline for QSBs to implement T+0 settlement systems extended beyond November 1, 2025
- Further guidance on the new deadline will be intimated at a later date
- Extension granted due to challenges in ensuring timely readiness of systems
- Applies to QSBs who met the minimum active client parameter as of December 31, 2024
- All other provisions of the original December 10, 2024 SEBI circular remain unchanged
- Stock exchanges, clearing corporations, and depositories must implement necessary systems and amend bylaws

## Regulatory Changes

This circular modifies the implementation timeline specified in:
- SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-3/P/CIR/2024/172 dated December 10, 2024 (original circular introducing enhanced scope of optional T+0 settlement)
- SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-3/P/CIR/2025/58 dated April 29, 2025 (first extension to November 1, 2025)

The regulatory framework for optional T+0 settlement cycle remains in place, but the mandatory implementation deadline for QSBs has been postponed pending further guidance.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs):**
- Must eventually implement systems and processes for enabling seamless investor participation in optional T+0 settlement cycle
- QSBs are those who met minimum active client parameters as of December 31, 2024
- New compliance deadline to be communicated later

**For Market Infrastructure Institutions (Stock Exchanges, Clearing Corporations, Depositories):**
- Take necessary steps and implement required systems
- Make necessary amendments to bylaws, rules, and regulations
- Bring provisions to the notice of market participants and investors
- Disseminate information on their websites

## Important Dates

- **October 30, 2025**: Date of this circular extending the timeline
- **November 1, 2025**: Previously scheduled deadline (now postponed)
- **December 31, 2024**: Reference date for determining QSB qualification based on active clients
- **May 1, 2025**: Original implementation date from the December 2024 circular
- **To be announced**: New deadline for mandatory QSB system implementation

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Delays the full-scale rollout of optional T+0 settlement infrastructure across all QSBs
- Provides relief to brokers facing technical implementation challenges
- May impact investor access to faster settlement cycles depending on their broker's readiness
- Optional T+0 settlement continues to be available where systems are ready

**Operational Impact:**
- Gives QSBs additional time to develop, test, and implement complex settlement systems
- Allows for smoother implementation by addressing systemic readiness concerns
- Stock exchanges and clearing corporations must continue preparation efforts
- Market participants should await further guidance on revised timelines

**Compliance Impact:**
- Reduces immediate compliance pressure on QSBs struggling with system readiness
- Maintains regulatory expectation of eventual full implementation
- All other provisions of T+0 settlement framework remain enforceable
