## Regulatory Changes

The price band revisions are part of BSE's ongoing surveillance mechanism to regulate volatility in specific securities. Tighter price bands (2% and 5%) indicate enhanced surveillance measures, while wider bands (20%) may indicate relaxation of restrictions. These changes are implemented to protect investor interests and maintain orderly market conditions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands from December 4, 2025
- All trading systems must be updated to reflect new price band limits
- Orders outside the revised price bands will be rejected
- Members should inform their clients about the revised trading limits

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 3, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 4, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The revised price bands will directly affect trading activity in these 7 securities. Tighter bands (2% for IEL Ltd and SPEL Semiconductor) will limit intraday price movements and may reduce speculative activity. The 20% band for Indowind Energy suggests either removal of restrictions or normal trading classification.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their risk management systems and inform clients about the new limits. Algorithmic trading strategies for these scrips may need recalibration.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of the restricted price movement limits, which may affect their ability to enter or exit positions at desired prices.
