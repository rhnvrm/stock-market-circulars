## Summary

BSE has updated the surveillance measures for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) framework, effective January 1, 2026. Five securities are moving to Stage 0 (receipt of corporate announcement), and one security (Indosolar Ltd) is being excluded from ASM for IBC. No securities are moving between Stage 1 and Stage 2 in this update.

## Key Points

- 5 securities moved to Stage 0 (Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from company)
- 1 security (Indosolar Ltd) excluded from ASM for IBC
- No securities added to Stage 1 from Stage 0
- No securities moved between Stage 1 and Stage 2
- Changes effective from January 1, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

**Securities Moving to Stage 0:**
1. A.F. Enterprises Ltd (538351, INE663P01015)
2. East India Drums and Barrels Manufacturing Ltd (523874, INE191C01023)
3. Seya Industries Ltd (524324, INE573R01012)
4. Swan Defence And Heavy Industries Ltd (533107, INE542F01020)
5. Tricom Fruit Products Ltd (531716, INE843F01014)

**Securities Excluded from ASM for IBC:**
1. Indosolar Ltd (533257, INE866K01023)

## Compliance Requirements

Investors and trading members should note the surveillance stage classifications for affected securities. Securities under IBC surveillance are subject to specific trading restrictions and monitoring mechanisms based on their stage classification.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** January 1, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The update affects 6 securities with limited broader market impact. The exclusion of Indosolar Ltd from IBC surveillance is positive for that security. The five securities moving to Stage 0 indicate receipt of corporate announcements regarding insolvency proceedings. Investors in these securities should monitor further developments closely as IBC proceedings can significantly impact stock valuations and trading activity.
