No securities are being moved to higher or lower ASM stages, moved to direct Stage IV, or exiting the framework during this update.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework continues to apply enhanced surveillance measures to securities exhibiting concerning trading patterns or price movements over extended periods. Securities in this framework are subject to additional monitoring and may have trading restrictions applied. The framework includes provisions for securities to move between different ASM stages based on ongoing surveillance.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of securities entering LT-ASM Framework
- Enhanced due diligence required for trading in listed securities
- Investors should note potential trading restrictions on affected securities
- Members must comply with surveillance framework requirements
- Special attention required for securities marked with asterisks, hash symbols, or other indicators denoting specific classifications

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 24, 2025 - New securities enter Long Term ASM Framework
- **Circular Date**: December 23, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of 7 securities to Long Term ASM Framework will subject them to enhanced surveillance and potential trading restrictions. This may result in reduced liquidity and increased price volatility for affected securities.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance measures and potential additional requirements. The LT-ASM designation signals regulatory concerns about trading patterns or price movements.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and risk management frameworks to account for LT-ASM restrictions on these securities. The stable nature of this update (no securities moving stages or exiting) suggests the framework is functioning as intended without major disruptions.
