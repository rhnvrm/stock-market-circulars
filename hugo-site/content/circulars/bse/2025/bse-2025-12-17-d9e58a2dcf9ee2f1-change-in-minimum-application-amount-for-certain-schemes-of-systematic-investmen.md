title: Change in Minimum Application Amount for SIP in Bajaj Finserv Mutual Fund Schemes
---

## Summary

Bajaj Finserv Asset Management Limited has announced changes to the minimum application amount and installment requirements for Systematic Investment Plans (SIP) in three of its mutual fund schemes: Bajaj Finserv Flexi Cap Fund, Bajaj Finserv Arbitrage Fund, and Bajaj Finserv Balanced Advantage Fund. The revised provisions simplify SIP requirements by eliminating the 60-installment minimum for investments between Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000, standardizing all SIPs at a minimum of 6 installments regardless of amount.

## Key Points

- Minimum SIP amount remains Rs. 500 across all three schemes
- Previous requirement of 60 minimum installments for investments between Rs. 500-1,000 has been removed
- New uniform requirement: minimum 6 installments for all SIP amounts of Rs. 500 and above
- Changes apply to Bajaj Finserv Flexi Cap Fund, Bajaj Finserv Arbitrage Fund, and Bajaj Finserv Balanced Advantage Fund
- All other provisions of the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) remain unchanged
- This addendum forms an integral part of the SID and KIM for the affected schemes

## Regulatory Changes

**Previous SIP Requirements:**
- Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000: minimum 60 installments
- Above Rs. 1,000: minimum 6 installments

**Revised SIP Requirements:**
- Rs. 500 and above: minimum 6 installments (uniform across all amounts)

This change makes smaller SIP investments more accessible by reducing the commitment period for investors starting with amounts up to Rs. 1,000.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors should note the revised minimum installment requirements when setting up new SIPs
- Existing SIPs are expected to continue under their original terms unless modified
- Investors should read all scheme-related documents carefully before investing
- The addendum must be read in conjunction with the existing SID and KIM documents

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date:** December 17, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 18, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact:**
- Positive impact for small investors as the barrier to entry is lowered
- Greater flexibility for retail investors wanting to start SIPs with smaller amounts
- Reduced long-term commitment requirement (from 60 months to 6 months for investments up to Rs. 1,000)

**Market Impact:**
- Minimal market impact as this is an administrative change specific to three Bajaj Finserv Mutual Fund schemes
- May encourage increased retail participation in systematic investment plans
- Aligns with market trends of making mutual fund investing more accessible

**Operational Impact:**
- No significant operational changes for existing investors
- New SIP registrations from December 18, 2025 will follow revised norms
