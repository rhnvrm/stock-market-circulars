## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market impact as it pertains to institutional debt securities issued on private placement basis. The AAA credit rating indicates high credit quality. Trading is restricted to dematerialized form with high face value (Rs. 1 lakh per unit), making these suitable only for institutional and high-net-worth investors. The listing expands the debt market offerings for infrastructure financing but does not affect retail equity markets or general trading activity.
