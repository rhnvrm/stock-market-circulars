## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - These are routine ESOP/ESOS conversions that minimally dilute existing shareholding. The number of shares being listed represents a small fraction of the total outstanding shares for most companies.

**Operational Impact:** Low - No special trading arrangements required. Securities will trade normally alongside existing shares.

**Investor Impact:** Minimal - No lock-in restrictions mean shares are immediately tradable. Existing shareholders may experience minor dilution, but ESOP issuances are typically factored into valuations.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible to positive - Additional floating stock may marginally improve liquidity, particularly for companies with smaller issuances relative to their market capitalization.
