## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects 106 securities with delivery shortages. While this is a routine settlement mechanism, the relatively large number of securities indicates notable delivery failures in this settlement cycle.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - brokers and clearing members with short positions in these securities must participate in the auction or face penalties. Large quantities in securities like STANDARD CAP (25,000), ATAL REALTEC (12,500), and TUNI TEXTILE (10,000) may experience temporary price volatility during auction.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - primarily affects institutional participants and brokers. Retail investors holding these securities may see temporary price movements during the auction period.
