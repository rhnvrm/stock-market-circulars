## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact:** Positive for existing shareholders as the 7-day extension provides additional time to arrange funds and exercise their rights entitlements. This may improve the subscription rate and participation in the rights issue.

**Market Impact:** Minimal market impact as this is an administrative extension. The extension indicates the company's intent to maximize shareholder participation, which could be viewed positively.

**Operational Impact:** Post-issue activities timeline will be delayed by approximately one week. Allotment, refunds, and listing of rights shares will occur later than originally scheduled.

**Note:** This is the second extension of the issue, as the closing date was previously extended from November 14, 2025 based on Board meetings held in October 2025.
