## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to bondholders and traders of these specific SBI bond series. The bonds are approaching maturity with redemption scheduled for end-December 2025. Trading suspension is temporary and procedural in nature.

**Operational Impact**: Bondholders registered as of the record dates will be entitled to receive the final interest payment and redemption proceeds. Trading members need to ensure no transactions are executed in these bonds from the specified dates to avoid settlement issues.

**Investor Impact**: Bondholders will receive redemption proceeds and accrued interest as per the bond terms. No adverse impact expected as this is a scheduled maturity event for privately placed bonds of a major public sector bank.
