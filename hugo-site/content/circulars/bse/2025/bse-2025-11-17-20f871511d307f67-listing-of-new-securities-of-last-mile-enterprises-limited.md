- The second tranche of 13,00,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 352031351 to 353331350) lock-in period not specified in the circular

## Important Dates

- **November 18, 2025**: Trading commencement date
- **May 30, 2026**: Lock-in expiry for first tranche (13,39,000 shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The listing of 26.39 lakh shares represents a preferential allotment to non-promoters, which is a relatively small issuance. The shares are subject to lock-in restrictions, preventing immediate selling pressure.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing following regulatory procedures for warrant conversion under preferential allotment norms.

**Investor Impact**: Current shareholders may experience minor dilution. The preferential issue at Rs. 17.50 per share indicates fundraising at a predetermined price to select investors. Lock-in provisions protect against immediate dumping but will add to tradable float post-expiry in May 2026.
