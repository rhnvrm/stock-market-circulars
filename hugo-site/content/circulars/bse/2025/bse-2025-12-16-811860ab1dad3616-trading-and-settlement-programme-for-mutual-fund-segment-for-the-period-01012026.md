## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects all mutual fund transactions on BSE Star MF platform during January 2026.

**Operational Impact**: Routine schedule that provides clarity for investors, distributors, and AMCs to plan their mutual fund transactions. The differentiation between liquid (T+0) and non-liquid (T+1) settlement continues as per standard practice.

**Investor Impact**: Investors need to be aware of the settlement timelines, particularly for liquid funds (same-day settlement) versus non-liquid funds (next-day unit allocation). Redemption proceeds will vary based on individual scheme TAT (ranging from T+1 to T+10), requiring investors to check scheme-specific details on the BSE Star MF Platform.

**Processing Impact**: The 21 trading days in January provide continuous market access except for weekends and specified holidays, ensuring regular liquidity for mutual fund investors.
