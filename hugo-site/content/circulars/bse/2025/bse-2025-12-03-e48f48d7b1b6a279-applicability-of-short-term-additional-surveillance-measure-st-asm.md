## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 04, 2025

## Regulatory Framework

The Short Term ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities that have witnessed abnormal price movements. Securities marked with:
- @ are SME scrips
- ~ are T+0 scrips (as per parent company)
- \* Securities noted in certain contexts
- $ Moving to ESM Framework
- # Moving to GSM Framework
- ^ Moving to Pledge Framework
- ** Moving to Trade for Trade Framework

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The addition of three SME securities to ST-ASM Stage I will result in enhanced surveillance and potentially stricter trading conditions for these scrips. Investors should exercise additional caution when trading these securities.

**Trading Impact:** Securities in ST-ASM framework typically face additional margin requirements, price bands, or other trading restrictions designed to curb excessive speculation and protect investors.

**Positive Development:** Two securities are exiting ST-ASM framework, with one (Pro Fin Capital Services) moving to ESM framework which may indicate different risk parameters.
