## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium - Limited to shareholders of JAINEX AAMCOL LIMITED only. Affects shareholders who wish to renounce their rights entitlements during the specified 4-day trading window.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading members need to ensure proper client communication, contract note disclaimers, and awareness of the short trading period (4 days) for renunciation. Trade-for-trade settlement requires specific handling.

**Investor Impact:** Medium - Shareholders have limited window (December 01-04, 2025) to trade REs and broader window (December 01-09, 2025) to subscribe to the Rights Issue. Failure to act will result in lapse of entitlements.
