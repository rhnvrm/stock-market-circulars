title: Discontinuation of Weekly Trading for Seven Hill Industries Ltd
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the discontinuation of weekly trading facility for Seven Hill Industries Ltd (scrip code 511760) effective December 16, 2025. The company was previously suspended for non-compliance with SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 2018, and was allowed to trade on a Trade for Trade basis in Z group on the first trading day of every week for six months. This six-month period has now been completed, triggering the discontinuation of this limited trading facility.

## Key Points

- Seven Hill Industries Ltd (scrip code 511760) will lose weekly trading facility from December 16, 2025
- Company was initially suspended via Exchange Notice No. 20250424-24 dated April 24, 2025
- Limited trading was allowed on Trade for Trade basis in Z group only on first trading day of each week
- Six-month mandatory period for weekly trading has been completed
- Action taken pursuant to SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024
- Non-compliance relates to SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 2018

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for suspension and revocation of equity shares as outlined in SEBI Master Circular dated November 11, 2024, Chapter-VII(A) covering Penal Actions for Non-Compliance. The discontinuation follows the completion of the mandated six-month period during which limited trading was permitted for suspended securities.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance actions required from market participants. This is an informational notice about the cessation of weekly trading facility for the affected company. Market participants should note that trading in Seven Hill Industries Ltd will no longer be available even on a weekly basis after December 16, 2025.

## Important Dates

- **April 24, 2025**: Initial suspension notice issued (Exchange Notice No. 20250424-24)
- **November 28, 2025**: Circular issued announcing discontinuation of weekly trading
- **December 16, 2025**: Effective date for discontinuation of weekly trading facility

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this circular is limited and affects only Seven Hill Industries Ltd and its shareholders. The company has been operating under restricted trading conditions (Trade for Trade basis in Z group, weekly only) since its initial suspension. The discontinuation of even this limited trading facility represents a further step in the enforcement process for non-compliant entities. For the broader market, there is negligible impact as this affects a single suspended security with minimal trading activity. Investors holding shares of Seven Hill Industries Ltd will have no trading avenue available after December 16, 2025.
