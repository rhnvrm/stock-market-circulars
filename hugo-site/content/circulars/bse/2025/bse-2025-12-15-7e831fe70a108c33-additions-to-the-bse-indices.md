## Important Dates

- **December 15, 2025**: Listing date for all five companies on BSE/BSE SME platform

- **December 17, 2025 (at market open)**: Main board companies added to BSE IPO index (Corona Remedies, Wakefit Innovations)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. These are routine index additions following the standard process for newly listed IPO companies. The additions affect specialized IPO tracking indices rather than broad market indices like Sensex or BSE 500.

**Investor Impact**: Passive funds and ETFs tracking BSE IPO or BSE SME IPO indices will need to incorporate these stocks. Index fund managers will execute purchases at the effective dates to maintain index tracking.

**Liquidity Impact**: May provide modest incremental demand for these newly listed stocks from index-tracking funds, though BSE IPO indices typically have limited assets under management compared to flagship indices.

**Operational Impact**: Changes reflected in corporate action files for automated processing by market systems and participants.
