title: Implementation of eligibility criteria for derivatives on existing Non-Benchmark
  Indices
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued implementation guidelines for eligibility criteria on existing Non-Benchmark Indices (NBIs) that have derivatives contracts. Stock exchanges must adjust constituents and weights in existing NBIs to comply with prudential norms stipulated in SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2025/79 dated May 29, 2025. BANKEX and FINNIFTY will implement changes in a single tranche, while BANKNIFTY will follow a phased approach over four monthly tranches to ensure orderly rebalancing.

## Key Points

- Stock exchanges must adjust existing NBIs to meet new eligibility criteria rather than creating separate indices
- Four prudential norms apply: minimum 14 constituents, top constituent weight ≤20%, top three constituents combined weight ≤45%, descending weight structure for all constituents
- BANKEX (BSE) and FINNIFTY (NSE) will implement compliance in a single tranche
- BANKNIFTY (NSE) will implement compliance over four monthly tranches
- Decision based on public consultation held August 18, 2025, and Secondary Market Advisory Committee (SMAC) recommendations
- Implementation considers impact on passive funds tracking indices and derivatives contracts

## Regulatory Changes

### Eligibility Criteria for Non-Benchmark Indices

As per SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2025/79 dated May 29, 2025, derivatives on NBIs must meet:

1. **Minimum constituents**: At least 14 stocks
2. **Top constituent weight**: Maximum 20%
3. **Top three constituents combined**: Maximum 45%
4. **Weight structure**: Descending order (all constituents' weights must be lower than higher-weighted constituents)

### Implementation Methodology

**Single Tranche Implementation** (BANKEX and FINNIFTY):
- Constituent and weight adjustments completed in one instance

**Phased Implementation** (BANKNIFTY):
- Four monthly tranches for orderly rebalancing
- New constituents added in Tranche 1
- Top 3 constituents assigned target weights achievable by end of Tranche 4
- Weight adjustments checked at each tranche; excess weight reduced equally over remaining tranches
- Example: If Rank 1 constituent weighs 28% (target 20%, excess 8%), weight reduced by 2% in first tranche to 26%, then re-evaluated and adjusted in subsequent tranches based on price movements

## Compliance Requirements

### For Stock Exchanges

- Must undertake constituent and weight adjustments in existing NBIs to comply with prudential norms
- Execute single tranche adjustments for BANKEX and FINNIFTY
- Implement four monthly tranches for BANKNIFTY rebalancing
- Re-evaluate constituent weights at the beginning of each tranche to confirm compliance with prudential norms
- Account for inter-tranche price movements when calculating weight adjustments for subsequent tranches

### Process

- Stock exchanges were required to submit proposals for NBIs with derivatives contracts within 30 days of SEBI circular dated May 29, 2025
- Adjustments must ensure orderly rebalancing of AUM tracking the indices
- Weight adjustment methodology must follow prescribed calculation: remaining excess weight divided equally across remaining tranches

## Important Dates

- **May 29, 2025**: SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2025/79 issued
- **August 18, 2025**: Public consultation conducted on implementation approach
- **October 30, 2025**: Current circular issued with implementation guidelines
- **Phased implementation**: BANKNIFTY adjustments over four monthly tranches (specific dates not provided in circular)

## Impact Assessment

### Market Impact

**High impact on derivatives market**: Changes affect three major derivative indices - BANKEX (BSE), FINNIFTY (NSE), and BANKNIFTY (NSE)

**Passive fund management**: Structural adjustments will impact passive funds and ETFs tracking these indices, requiring portfolio rebalancing

**Derivatives contracts**: Existing futures and options contracts on these indices may experience volatility during adjustment periods

### Implementation Considerations

**BANKNIFTY phased approach**: The four-tranche methodology for BANKNIFTY acknowledges the significant market impact and need for orderly transition, suggesting this index has substantial tracking AUM

**Price movement adjustments**: The methodology accounts for inter-tranche price movements by re-evaluating weights at each stage, providing flexibility while maintaining compliance trajectory

**Risk mitigation**: Phased implementation reduces shock to passive fund portfolios and derivatives markets compared to single-tranche adjustment

### Operational Impact

- Index providers must recalculate and rebalance index compositions
- Market participants must adjust derivatives strategies based on new index structures
- Passive fund managers need to realign portfolios across multiple tranches for BANKNIFTY-tracking products
