## Summary

BSE has announced the commencement of trading in Rights Entitlements (REs) for renunciation of COVIDH TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED.

- Scrip Code: 751052, Scrip ID: COVIDH-RE, ISIN: INE899M20012
- Market lot: 1, Group: R
- Settlement on T+1 Rolling Settlement basis
- Trade-for-trade settlement applicable
- REs tradable in dematerialized form only
- Rights Issue open period: November 03-10, 2025
- Unsubscribed or unrenounced REs will lapse after Issue Closing Date

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular follows existing framework for Rights Entitlements trading as per previous notices (20200305-21 dated March 05, 2020 and 20200518-34 dated May 18, 2020).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must inform all clients about commencement of RE trading, mentioning the ISIN (INE899M20012)
- Trading Members must clarify that REs should not be mistaken for ordinary shares
- Contract notes/bills for RE purchases must include prominent disclaimer informing clients that:
  - Purchase of REs only grants right to participate in the ongoing Rights Issue
  - REs can be subscribed with requisite application money or renounced before issue closes
  - Unsubscribed/unrenounced REs will lapse and be extinguished after Issue Closing Date
- Trading Members must refer to notice nos. 20200305-21 and 20200518-34 for additional details

## Important Dates

- **October 30, 2025**: Notice date
- **November 03, 2025**: RE trading commences; Rights Issue opens
- **November 04, 2025**: RE trading ends
- **November 10, 2025**: Rights Issue closes
- **After November 10, 2025**: Unexercised REs will lapse and be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to existing shareholders of COVIDH TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED. The two-day trading window for renunciation provides liquidity for shareholders who do not wish to participate in the rights issue.

**Operational Impact**: Trading Members need to ensure proper client communication and contract note disclaimers. The short renunciation period (2 days) requires prompt action from shareholders.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders must decide within the trading window whether to subscribe, renounce, or let REs lapse. Those purchasing REs in the secondary market gain the right to participate in the rights issue but must apply with requisite funds before November 10, 2025.
