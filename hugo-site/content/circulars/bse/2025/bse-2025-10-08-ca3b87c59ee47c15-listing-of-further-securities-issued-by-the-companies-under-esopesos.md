## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to update their systems to reflect the new securities
- Companies must ensure proper dematerialization and allocation of distinctive numbers as specified
- Standard compliance with SEBI ESOP regulations already in place

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 8, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date:** October 9, 2025 (Thursday)
- **Lock-in Period:** Not Applicable (NA) for all six companies

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The issuance represents routine ESOP/ESOS exercise conversions with relatively small quantities compared to the total outstanding shares of these companies, particularly for large-cap entities like ICICI Bank. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares are immediately available for trading, though dilution impact is negligible.

**Operational Impact:** Standard operational update for trading members to recognize new ISIN quantities. No special trading arrangements or restrictions apply.
