### Operational Impact
- **Company:** Delayed fundraising completion and capital availability
- **Registrars:** Extended processing timeline for applications and allotment
- **Investors:** More time for decision-making and fund arrangement

### Financial Impact
- Issue at face value (Re. 1.00) indicates dilutive nature for existing operations
- Total potential fundraise of Rs. 48.08 crores if fully subscribed
- Extension suggests potential need to improve subscription levels
