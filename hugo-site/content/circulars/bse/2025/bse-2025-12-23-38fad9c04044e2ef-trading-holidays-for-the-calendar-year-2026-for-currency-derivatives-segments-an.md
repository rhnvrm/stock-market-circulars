**Affected Segments**: 
- Currency Derivatives Segment (all currency derivatives products)
- Interest Rate Derivatives products
- Debt Segment (NDS-RST)

**Operational Planning**: Market participants need to adjust trading strategies, margin requirements, and settlement obligations around the holiday schedule.

**Special Consideration**: Muhurat Trading on Sunday, November 8, 2026 will require special operational arrangements as it falls on a weekend.
