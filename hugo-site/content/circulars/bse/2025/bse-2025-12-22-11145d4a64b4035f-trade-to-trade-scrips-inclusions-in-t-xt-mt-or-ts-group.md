## Summary

BSE has announced the shifting of 29 securities from the rolling segment to the trade-for-trade (T2T) segment with a price band of 5% or lower, effective December 26, 2025. This includes 23 securities moving to the XT group, 3 securities to the T group, and 6 SME securities to the MT group. Additionally, 15 securities will be retained in the trade-for-trade segment. This surveillance measure restricts intraday trading and applies tighter price controls on the affected scrips.

## Key Points

- 29 securities being shifted from rolling segment to trade-for-trade segment effective December 26, 2025
- 23 securities moving from X group to XT group
- 3 securities moving from B group to T group
- 6 SME securities moving from M group to MT group
- 15 securities to be retained in trade-for-trade segment with 5% price band
- Trade-for-trade segment eliminates intraday trading - all trades must result in delivery
- Price band restricted to 5% or lower for all affected securities

## Regulatory Changes

Securities moved to trade-for-trade segment are subject to enhanced surveillance measures including:

- Elimination of intraday trading (squared-off positions not allowed)
- Compulsory delivery for all trades
- Price band restriction of 5% or lower
- Group designation change (X to XT, B to T, M to MT)

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure all trades in affected securities result in delivery
- No intraday speculation or squared-off positions permitted
- Clients must have adequate funds/securities before trading
- Settlement through compulsory delivery mechanism only
- Price band restrictions must be observed

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 26, 2025 - Securities will be shifted to respective T2T groups
- All changes applicable from market opening on December 26, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The shift to trade-for-trade segment significantly impacts liquidity in affected securities by eliminating intraday trading and speculative activity. The 5% price band further restricts price volatility.

**Trading Impact**: Traders cannot take speculative intraday positions in these 29 securities. All trades require full delivery, increasing capital requirements and reducing trading flexibility.

**Investor Impact**: Long-term investors minimally affected, but short-term traders face significant constraints. The measure aims to curb excessive speculation and protect investor interests in volatile scrips.

**Liquidity Impact**: Expected reduction in trading volumes due to elimination of intraday trading, potentially widening bid-ask spreads and reducing market depth.
