## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to be applied based on BSE's surveillance criteria for securities exhibiting unusual price movements or volatility. Securities can enter or exit the framework based on their trading behavior and may transition to other surveillance measures such as Long Term ASM (LT-ASM), Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM), Trade for Trade, Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM), or Pledge Framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the securities under ST-ASM and comply with the framework requirements
- Securities under ST-ASM are subject to specific trading restrictions including price bands and position limits
- Market participants should review their positions in affected securities
- SME scrips and T+0 scrips have special designations within the framework

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: November 7, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 10, 2025 (for all inclusions and exclusions)

## Impact Assessment

The ST-ASM framework is designed to curb excessive speculation and protect investor interests in securities showing abnormal price movements. Securities entering the framework will face enhanced surveillance and trading restrictions, which may impact liquidity and trading volumes. Securities exiting ST-ASM either showed normalized trading patterns or are being moved to other appropriate surveillance frameworks. Market participants holding positions in the 11 newly included securities should prepare for stricter trading conditions, while those in exiting securities may see normalized trading (unless moved to another restrictive framework like LT-ASM or ESM).
