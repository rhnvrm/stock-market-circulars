## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this affects a private limited company's debt securities. The part redemption reduces the outstanding principal amount of the debentures, returning capital to debenture holders. Existing debenture holders will receive interest payment along with partial redemption proceeds on the record date. Trading liquidity may be minimal given the private nature of the issuer. This is a standard corporate action in the debt market segment with no broader market implications.
