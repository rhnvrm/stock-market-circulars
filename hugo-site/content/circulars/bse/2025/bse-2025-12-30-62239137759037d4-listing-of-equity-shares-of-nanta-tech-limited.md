## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Introduction of new security to BSE with total issue size of 5.13 million shares. Initial liquidity will be limited due to significant portion (79%) being under lock-in.

**Trading Liquidity**: Only 1,086,000 shares (21% of total) are immediately available for trading without restrictions. Full liquidity will be achieved progressively as lock-in periods expire through 2028.

**Investor Consideration**: Anchor investors have short lock-in periods (1-3 months), while promoter/strategic holdings appear to have longer lock-ins (1-3 years), indicating strong promoter commitment to the company.
