## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects 37 securities with varying liquidity levels. Tighter price bands (1%-5%) will significantly restrict intraday volatility and may reduce liquidity in those scrips.

**Trading Impact:** Investors and traders in these securities will face limited price movement ranges. Securities with 1%-5% bands will have highly restricted trading ranges, potentially impacting exit strategies and arbitrage opportunities.

**Investor Impact:** Existing holders may experience reduced ability to exit positions quickly at desired prices. New investors should be aware of restricted volatility before entering positions.

**Surveillance Rationale:** Price band revisions typically indicate BSE's concern about price manipulation, excessive speculation, or need for enhanced monitoring in these securities.
