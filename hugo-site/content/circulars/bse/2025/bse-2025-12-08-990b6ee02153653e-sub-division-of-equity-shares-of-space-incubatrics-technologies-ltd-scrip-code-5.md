## Summary

BSE has informed trading members that Space Incubatrics Technologies Ltd (Scrip Code: 541890) has fixed December 19, 2025 as the record date for sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of face value Rs.10/- will be sub-divided into ten equity shares of face value Re.1/- each. The existing ISIN INE797Z01010 will become invalid for exchange transactions from December 19, 2025, and a new ISIN for Re.1/- paid-up shares will be communicated separately.

## Key Points

- Company: Space Incubatrics Technologies Ltd (Scrip Code: 541890)
- Corporate action: Sub-division of equity shares in 1:10 ratio
- Record date: December 19, 2025
- Old face value: Rs.10/- per equity share
- New face value: Re.1/- per equity share
- Effective date: December 19, 2025
- Existing ISIN INE797Z01010 (Rs.10/-) will not be valid for transactions from December 19, 2025
- New ISIN for Re.1/- paid-up shares to be announced via separate notice
- Notice reference: DR-781/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action under existing regulations allowing companies to sub-divide shares to improve liquidity and affordability.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date of December 19, 2025
- All transactions from December 19, 2025 must be conducted using the new ISIN (to be announced)
- Members should not accept trades using old ISIN INE797Z01010 from the effective date
- Systems must be updated to reflect the new face value of Re.1/- per share
- Depositories and brokers must update their records to reflect the 1:10 split ratio

## Important Dates

- **December 8, 2025**: Circular announcement date
- **December 19, 2025**: Record date for sub-division; effective date from which old ISIN becomes invalid and new face value applies

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares of Re.1/- face value for every 1 share of Rs.10/- face value held. Total investment value remains unchanged, but the number of shares increases tenfold.

**Market Impact**: Sub-division typically aims to improve liquidity by reducing per-share price, making shares more affordable for retail investors. Trading will continue under new ISIN from December 19, 2025.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members, depositories, and custodians must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN, face value, and adjusted share quantities. The old ISIN will cease to be valid for exchange transactions from the effective date.
