## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The OFS of 1.57 crore shares represents a significant transaction for TWAMEV CONSTRUCTION AND INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITED. The two-day bidding structure with separate sessions for institutional and retail investors ensures orderly price discovery.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure their systems and processes are prepared for the OFS sessions on both days. The price priority allocation method means competitive bidding above the floor price of Rs. 32.50 will determine final allocation.

**Investor Impact:** Retail investors have dedicated access on T+1 day with the benefit of using cash equivalents as collateral. However, they must be aware that bidding in the NII category (above Rs. 2 lakhs value) disqualifies them from any seller discounts. Institutional investors have the flexibility of 0% margin bidding with settlement on T+2, though they must complete give-up/take-up by 7:30 AM deadlines.
