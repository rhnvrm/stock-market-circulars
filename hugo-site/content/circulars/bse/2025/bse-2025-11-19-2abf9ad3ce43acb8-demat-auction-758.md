The auction list includes major stocks like Infosys, NTPC, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Adani Group companies, and numerous mid-cap and small-cap securities with varying quantities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must arrange for auction settlement as per BSE auction procedures
- Payment and delivery obligations to be fulfilled as per auction settlement timeline
- Non-compliance will result in close-out at higher prices and penalty charges

## Important Dates

- **Auction Date**: November 19, 2025
- Settlement details and payment timelines to follow as per standard BSE auction calendar

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Members with short delivery positions across these 100+ securities must participate in auctions to close their positions. Large quantities in certain scrips (Reliance Power - 200,000 shares, Spright Agro - 499,754 shares) may see significant price impact during auction.

**Market Impact**: Demat auctions typically execute at premium prices compared to market rates, resulting in financial losses for defaulting members. Stocks with larger auction quantities may experience temporary price pressure or volatility.

**Member Impact**: Brokers and trading members with clients who failed to deliver shares will incur additional costs from auction buy-ins, which are typically passed to the defaulting clients along with penalties.
