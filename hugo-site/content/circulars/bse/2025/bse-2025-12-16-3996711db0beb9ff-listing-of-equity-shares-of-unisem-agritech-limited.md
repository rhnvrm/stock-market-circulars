## Impact Assessment

This listing adds a new trading security to BSE. The staggered lock-in periods will result in gradual release of shares into the market over a three-year period. The immediate free float of 2,364,000 shares (approximately 20.9% of total listed shares) provides initial liquidity. Investors should note the lock-in expiry dates as they may impact share price and trading volumes when significant quantities of shares become available for trading.
