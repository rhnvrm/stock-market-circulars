## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard procedural notification for ESOP/ESOS share listings.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to update their systems for the new shares
- Companies have completed allotment procedures as per SEBI ESOP guidelines
- No additional compliance requirements for investors or trading members

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 28, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: December 1, 2025 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (NA) - shares are freely tradable from listing date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The issuance of ESOP/ESOS shares represents routine employee compensation activity and typically has minimal impact on stock prices or trading volumes. The quantities being listed are relatively small compared to the existing share capital of these companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in floating stock for most companies, with the exception of larger issuances by Hexaware Technologies and RBL Bank.

**Investor Consideration**: ESOP/ESOS shares being listed without lock-in indicates these are fully vested options being exercised by employees, which is a normal corporate practice and does not signal any material change in company fundamentals.
