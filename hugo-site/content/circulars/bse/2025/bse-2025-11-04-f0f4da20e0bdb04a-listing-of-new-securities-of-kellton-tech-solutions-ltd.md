## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of over 10 million new shares represents significant dilution to existing shareholders. Investors should monitor the impact on share price and trading volumes upon listing. The FCCB conversion increases the company's equity base and free float.

**Operational Impact**: The conversion of FCCBs to equity reduces the company's debt obligations and improves the debt-to-equity ratio. This is generally positive for the company's financial health as it eliminates future debt servicing requirements for the converted bonds.

**Investor Consideration**: The issue price of Rs. 21.20 per share should be compared with the current market price to assess potential dilution impact. The pari-passu status means these shares have equal rights to dividends and voting.
