## Summary

BSE has issued Notice No. 20251201-54 announcing the transfer of 30 scrips to the 'Z'/'MT' (Z-group/MT-group) segment effective December 12, 2025. These companies have failed to comply with Regulation 34 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 for two consecutive financial years (March 2024 and March 2025), relating to annual report filing requirements. All these companies are already in the 'Z'/'MT' group, and this action reinforces their restricted trading status. Trading in these scrips will be conducted on a Trade-for-Trade basis only.
