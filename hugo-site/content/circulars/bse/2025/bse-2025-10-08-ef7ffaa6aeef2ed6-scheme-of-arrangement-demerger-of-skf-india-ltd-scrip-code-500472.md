## Important Dates

- **8 October 2025**: Notice date and circular issuance
- **15 October 2025**: Record date for determining shareholder entitlement
- **15 October 2025**: Ex-entitlement date (Settlement No. DR-736/2025-2026)
- **15 October 2025**: Transfer of scrip from 'A' Group to 'T' Group
- **15 October 2025**: Special Pre-open Session (SPOS) implementation

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The demerger represents a significant corporate restructuring that will result in two separate listed entities. The 1:1 share allotment ratio means existing shareholders will maintain equal stake in both the demerged and resulting companies. The transfer to 'T' Group (Trade-to-Trade settlement) will restrict intraday trading and require delivery-based settlement, potentially impacting liquidity and trading patterns.

**Shareholder Impact**: High - All shareholders on record date will receive additional shares in SKF India (Industrial) Limited. Portfolio holdings will be split between two companies, requiring adjustment in investment strategies and tracking.

**Operational Impact**: The Special Pre-open Session (SPOS) on 15 October 2025 will determine price discovery through call auction mechanism before regular trading begins. Trading members need to prepare systems and inform clients about the changes in trading mechanism and group classification.

**Listing Impact**: The resulting company SKF India (Industrial) Limited will be newly listed on BSE, expanding the number of listed entities in the bearing and automotive components sector.
