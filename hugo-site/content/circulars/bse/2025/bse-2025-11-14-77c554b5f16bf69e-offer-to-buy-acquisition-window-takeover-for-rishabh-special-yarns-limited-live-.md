## Impact Assessment

### Market Impact: Low

The acquisition window is for a relatively small offer size (9.25 lakh shares) of a company that is only listed on Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India, not on BSE's main trading platform. This limits the broader market impact.

### Operational Impact: Medium

Trading Members and Custodian Members need to:
- Ensure operational readiness for OTB module participation
- Update investor UCC records with correct PAN and category details
- Coordinate with clients holding shares in demat form
- Access multiple platforms (iBBS, RTRMS, Extranet) during the 14-day window
