## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Inform all clients about commencement of trading in REs with the specific ISIN (INE505Y20010)
- Ensure clients understand REs are not ordinary shares of the company
- Include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases stating:
  - Purchase of REs only grants right to participate in ongoing Rights Issue by making application with requisite money OR renounce the REs before issue closes
  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced on or before Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects existing shareholders of VINEET LABORATORIES LIMITED who wish to exercise, renounce or trade their rights entitlements.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure proper client communication and contract note disclaimers. The 16-day trading window for REs (January 01-16) provides shareholders flexibility to renounce rights before the issue closes on January 21, 2026.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders must act within the specified timeframes to either subscribe to the rights issue, renounce their entitlements, or trade them in the market. Failure to act will result in lapse of entitlements after the issue closing date.
