## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Provides opportunity for retail and institutional investors to acquire shares in D.S. Kulkarni Developers at a predetermined price of Rs. 10 per share. The staggered bidding schedule (T Day for non-retail, T+1 for retail) follows standard OFS procedures.

**Company Impact**: Helps the company achieve minimum public shareholding compliance as required by SEBI regulations. The sale by a non-promoter shareholder (DSK Shareholders Trust) does not affect promoter holding but increases public float.

**Regulatory Impact**: Transaction demonstrates compliance with SEBI's OFS framework and follows the approved resolution plan under NCLT supervision, indicating structured approach to shareholding restructuring.
