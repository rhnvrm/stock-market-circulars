## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational notification for listing of securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities available for trading
- Companies have complied with listing requirements for ESOP/ESOS issued shares
- All securities listed without lock-in restrictions, available for immediate trading
- Standard settlement and trading procedures apply to these securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 13, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date**: November 14, 2025 (Friday)
- **Lock-in Period**: Not Applicable (NA) for all listed securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal to low. The shares being listed represent ESOP/ESOS allocations which are routine corporate actions. The quantities are relatively small compared to the outstanding shares of these large-cap and mid-cap companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in floating stock for each company. The largest issuance (Capri Global Capital at 518,840 shares) and second largest (PG Electroplast at 275,500 shares) may see minor dilution, but unlikely to affect trading patterns.

**Stakeholder Impact**: Primarily affects employees who received these stock options and can now trade them freely. No lock-in restrictions allow immediate monetization if desired.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect increased outstanding shares for these 9 companies effective November 14, 2025.
