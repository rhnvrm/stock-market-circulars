## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt security listing with minimal market impact. The private placement of Rs. 50 crore by UGRO Capital Limited adds to the company's debt capital raising activities. The relatively high interest rate of 11.65% reflects the company's credit profile (IND A+ rating) and current market conditions for NBFC debt securities. Trading members dealing in debt securities can now trade these instruments on the BSE platform. No significant operational or market-wide implications are expected from this listing.
