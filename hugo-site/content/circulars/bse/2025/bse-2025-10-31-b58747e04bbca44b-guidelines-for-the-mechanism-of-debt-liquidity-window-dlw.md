title: Guidelines for the Mechanism of Debt Liquidity Window (DLW)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued comprehensive operational guidelines for the Debt Liquidity Window (DLW) mechanism, following SEBI circular SEBI/HO/DDHS/DDHS-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/141 dated October 16, 2024. The DLW facility allows issuers of debt securities to provide liquidity to eligible investors through the stock exchange platform. This is an optional facility available on an ISIN basis for prospectively issued debt securities (both public issues and private placements). The guidelines cover system requirements, order placement processes, bid entry procedures, settlement mechanisms, and file formats for members.

## Key Points

- DLW is an optional liquidity facility that debt issuers can provide at their discretion on an ISIN basis
- Applicable only to prospective issuances of debt securities through public issue or private placement (proposed to be listed)
- Requires prior approval from the issuer's Board of Directors
- Implementation and outcomes must be monitored by Stakeholders Relationship Committee (SRC) or Board/board-level committee
- Must be objective, transparent, non-discretionary and non-discriminatory
- Trading conducted through BSE's iBBS (Internet Based Book Building System)
- Supports both manual bid entry and bulk upload functionality
- Includes online give-up facility for bids
- Settlement process follows standard DEMAT securities clearing procedures
- Contract notes to be generated for executed trades
- Transaction charges, STT and other levies applicable as per regulations
