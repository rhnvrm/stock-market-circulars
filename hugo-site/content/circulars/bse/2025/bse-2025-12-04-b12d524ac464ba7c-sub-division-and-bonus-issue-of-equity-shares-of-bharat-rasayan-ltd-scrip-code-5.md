## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High impact on trading as the effective result is a 4x increase in number of shares outstanding (2x from sub-division, then 2x from bonus issue). This will significantly improve liquidity and make shares more accessible to retail investors with lower price per share.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their shareholding increase from 1 share to 4 shares (1 becomes 2 after sub-division, then doubles to 4 after 1:1 bonus), while maintaining the same proportionate ownership in the company. No cash outflow required from shareholders.

**Trading Impact**: Post-corporate action, the stock price will adjust proportionately. Investors should note the new ISIN and distinctive number ranges when trading. The sub-division and bonus combination effectively splits the stock 1:4.
