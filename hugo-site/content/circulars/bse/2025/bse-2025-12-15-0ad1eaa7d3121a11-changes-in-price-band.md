## Regulatory Changes

The varying levels (2%, 5%, 10%, 20%) indicate different degrees of surveillance concern for each security.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 15, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 16, 2025 - Revised price bands become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revised price bands will significantly restrict intraday price movements for these 16 securities. Transchem Ltd faces the most restrictive control at 2%, severely limiting trading volatility. Securities under 5% bands will experience substantial trading restrictions compared to normal market conditions.

**Liquidity Impact**: Tighter price bands typically reduce liquidity as the restricted price range may prevent natural price discovery and limit trading opportunities. Market makers and traders may face challenges in executing large orders.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in these securities will experience limited ability to exit or enter positions at desired prices during volatile market conditions. The restrictions suggest these securities are under enhanced surveillance, potentially indicating concerns about price manipulation, low liquidity, or unusual trading patterns.

**Trading Strategy Impact**: Day traders and short-term investors will be most affected, as the reduced price movement limits profit potential from intraday volatility.
