## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a routine listing announcement for a preferential allotment of shares representing warrant conversion. The relatively small number of shares (750,000) and the complete lock-in restriction until June 29, 2026 means there will be no immediate trading impact or liquidity addition to the market.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members can recognize these securities in the system starting December 12, 2025, but must enforce lock-in restrictions on all shares.

**Company Impact:** Dilutive effect for HB Estate Developers Ltd shareholders, with capital raising of approximately Rs. 4.89 crores (750,000 × Rs. 65.25). The preferential allotment to non-promoters may indicate fundraising for business expansion or debt reduction.
