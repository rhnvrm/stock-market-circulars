---

## Summary

BSE has issued a notice regarding the allocation of a new ISIN number for BEML Ltd (Scrip Code: 500048) following the sub-division of equity shares. The face value of equity shares will be sub-divided from Rs.10/- to Rs.5/-, with a new ISIN number INE258A01024 assigned to the sub-divided shares. This change will be effective for all trades executed on or after November 3, 2025 (Ex-Date).

## Key Points

- New ISIN number allocated: INE258A01024
- Company: BEML Ltd (Scrip Code: 500048)
- Corporate action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Face value change: Rs.10/- per share to Rs.5/- per share
- Effective date: November 3, 2025 (Ex-Date)
- Debit reference: DR-748/2025-2026
- Notice issued in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251014-5 dated October 14, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action notification following SEBI guidelines for share sub-division and ISIN reallocation.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number INE258A01024 before the ex-date
- All trades executed on or after November 3, 2025 must use the new ISIN number
- Market participants should ensure proper mapping of the old and new ISIN numbers in their records
- Demat accounts will reflect the increased number of shares post sub-division with reduced face value

## Important Dates

- **October 14, 2025**: Original notice issued (Notice No. 20251014-5)
- **October 30, 2025**: Current notice date announcing new ISIN
- **November 3, 2025**: Ex-date for sub-division; new ISIN becomes effective for trading

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares while reducing the per-share price proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors without changing the company's market capitalization.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and custodians must update their systems to recognize the new ISIN number. Shareholders will see their shareholding quantity doubled while the face value is halved. The corporate action is administrative in nature and does not affect the overall value of investments.
