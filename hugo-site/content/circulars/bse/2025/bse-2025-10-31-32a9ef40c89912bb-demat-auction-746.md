**Market Impact**: Medium - The auction involves 116 securities with varying quantities. Large quantities in stocks like Vikas Lifecare (120,414 shares), Sagility Limited (45,545 shares), and New Light Industries (26,942 shares) could see temporary price volatility during auction hours.

**Operational Impact**: Affects brokers and trading members who have failed to deliver securities in the normal settlement cycle. These members must now procure shares through the auction mechanism, typically at higher prices.

**Liquidity Impact**: Securities with smaller quantities (1-100 shares) will see minimal impact, while those with larger auction quantities may experience temporary liquidity constraints and price pressure.

**Sector Distribution**: The auction covers a broad spectrum including power (Adani Green, Adani Power, NHPC), automobiles (Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland), banking (State Bank of India), and various mid/small-cap companies across manufacturing, textiles, and technology sectors.
