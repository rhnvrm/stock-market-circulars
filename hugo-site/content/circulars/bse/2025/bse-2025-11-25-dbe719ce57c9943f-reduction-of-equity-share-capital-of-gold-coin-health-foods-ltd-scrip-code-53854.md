## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Shareholders**: Shareholders holding 2 equity shares of Rs.5 each will receive 1 equity share of Rs.10 each. While the total number of shares will be reduced by half (from 30,00,900 to 15,00,450), the proportionate ownership and total paid-up capital value remains unchanged at Rs.1,50,04,500.

**Impact on Trading**: Trading in the scrip will be suspended from November 27, 2025 to facilitate the capital restructuring process. This will affect liquidity temporarily.

**Impact on Market**: This is a neutral corporate action from a value perspective as shareholding proportions remain consistent. However, the consolidation may affect odd-lot holders due to rounding off of fractional shares. The reduction in total share count may impact liquidity post-resumption of trading.
