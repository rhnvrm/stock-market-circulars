## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - This affects all traders holding open positions in Hindustan Unilever derivatives. The forced expiry of all F&O contracts requires immediate action from market participants to close, roll over, or manage their positions before December 04, 2025.

**Operational Impact:** High - Trading members need to communicate with clients urgently, manage position closures, handle margin requirements during transition, and prepare for new contract introductions with different strike prices based on adjusted underlying price.

**Liquidity Impact:** Potential volatility and liquidity concerns during the transition period, especially on December 04 (last day) and December 05 (reintroduction day). The special pre-open session will be critical for price discovery.

**Risk Considerations:** Traders must assess the impact of the corporate action on their hedging strategies, as the underlying security will trade ex-demerger with adjusted fundamentals reflecting the separation of Kwality Wall's business.
