## Summary

BSE has announced the resumption of trading in three debenture series of PRACHAY CAPITAL LIMITED (Scrip Codes 976842, 976849 & 976850) effective November 13, 2025. Trading was previously suspended to facilitate put option exercise by debenture holders. As the put options were not exercised, normal trading will resume.

## Key Points

- Trading will resume in three debenture series: Scrip Codes 976842, 976849, and 976850
- Resumption effective from November 13, 2025
- Put options were not exercised by debenture holders
- Notice issued under reference DR-755/2025-2026
- Follows previous notices regarding record dates for interest payment and early redemption on put option exercise

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a procedural notification regarding trading resumption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members should note the resumption of trading in the specified debentures
- No specific compliance actions required from members

## Important Dates

- **November 13, 2025**: Trading resumption effective date
- **Previous Record Dates**: October 24, 2025, September 19, 2025, and October 9, 2025 (for interest payment and put option exercise)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine procedural matter affecting only the debt segment. Trading resumption allows normal market activity in these specific debenture instruments. The non-exercise of put options indicates debenture holders chose to retain their holdings rather than seek early redemption.
