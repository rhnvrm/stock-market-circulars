## Impact Assessment

This listing represents a corporate restructuring under IBC with significant ownership changes. The complete extinguishment of promoter holdings and substantial capital reduction (from 7.48 crore to 4.43 lakh public shares) indicates major corporate action. The preferential allotment of 84.20 lakh shares to the resolution applicant makes them the majority shareholder with 95% holding (locked-in until December 2026). Trading in XT group and Trade-to-Trade segment suggests higher risk profile requiring mandatory delivery-based trading. Investors should note the company's IBC background and significant shareholding concentration with the resolution applicant.
