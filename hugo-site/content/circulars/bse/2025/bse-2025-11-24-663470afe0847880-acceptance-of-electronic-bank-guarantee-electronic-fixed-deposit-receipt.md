## Summary

Indian Clearing Corporation Limited (ICCL) has announced that AU Small Finance Bank will now provide Electronic Bank Guarantee (E-BG) and Electronic Fixed Deposit Receipt (E-FDR) facilities to members effective November 24, 2025. This is an extension of the facility previously announced via circular no. 20231113-18 dated November 13, 2023.

## Key Points

- AU Small Finance Bank added to the list of banks offering E-BG and E-FDR facilities
- Facility becomes available to members from November 24, 2025
- This is a continuation of the electronic collateral management initiative started in November 2023
- Members can contact their Relationship Managers or Collateral Management team for clarifications

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational enhancement expanding the list of banks participating in the electronic collateral management system.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. Members who wish to utilize E-BG or E-FDR facilities from AU Small Finance Bank can do so voluntarily from the effective date.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 24, 2025 - AU Small Finance Bank begins providing E-BG and E-FDR facility
- **Reference Circular**: November 13, 2023 (circular no. 20231113-18) - Original circular on electronic collateral facilities

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Positive but minimal. Members gain one additional banking option for submitting electronic bank guarantees and fixed deposit receipts as collateral, providing slightly more flexibility in collateral management.

**Market Impact**: Negligible. This is a back-office operational enhancement that does not affect trading, settlement processes, or market participants' obligations.

**Member Benefits**: Increased choice in banking partners for electronic collateral submission, potentially reducing paperwork and processing time for members who already bank with AU Small Finance Bank.
