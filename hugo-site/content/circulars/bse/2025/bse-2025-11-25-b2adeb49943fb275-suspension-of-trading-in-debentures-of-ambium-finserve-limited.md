- Record date set for December 6, 2025
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from December 5, 2025
- **Brokers**: Need to update their systems to block trading in ISIN INE0RU307130

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The suspension affects liquidity for holders of this specific debenture series who will not be able to exit their positions through the exchange after December 4, 2025. However, this is a scheduled corporate action with advance notice.
