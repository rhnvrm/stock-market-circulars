## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing announcement with minimal market impact. The issuance represents approximately 15.73 lakh shares added to the tradable base, though all shares are subject to lock-in until July 31, 2026, meaning they cannot be traded during this period. The preferential allotment to non-promoters at Rs. 50 per share was executed through warrant conversion, a standard corporate action. The lock-in restriction limits immediate liquidity impact.
