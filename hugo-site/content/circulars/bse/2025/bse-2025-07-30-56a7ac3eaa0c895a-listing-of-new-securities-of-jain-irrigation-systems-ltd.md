## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following warrant conversion as per existing SEBI regulations for preferential allotments.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities available for trading
- Promoters must comply with lock-in restrictions until January 30, 2027
- Standard disclosure and reporting requirements apply for the enlarged share capital

- Allotment Date: May 22, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The listing represents a significant increase in share capital through promoter preferential allotment. With a 20-month lock-in period, immediate market impact is limited as these shares cannot be traded by promoters. The conversion from warrants to equity shares provides additional capital to the company while maintaining promoter control during the lock-in period.
