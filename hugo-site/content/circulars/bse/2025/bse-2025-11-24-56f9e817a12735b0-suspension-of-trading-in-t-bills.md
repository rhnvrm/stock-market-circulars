## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in three debt securities effective November 25, 2025. The suspension affects two Treasury Bills (182-day T-bill maturing 27/11/2025 and 364-day T-bill maturing 27/11/2025) and Sovereign Gold Bond 2017 Series III. Trading members are advised not to deal in these securities from the effective date as they are approaching their redemption dates.

## Key Points

- Three debt securities will be suspended from trading effective November 25, 2025
- Suspension applies to: 182T271125 (ISIN: IN002025Y099, Scrip Code: 805071)
- Suspension applies to: 364TB271125 (ISIN: IN002024Z339, Scrip Code: 804994)
- Suspension applies to: Sovereign Gold Bond 2017 Series III (ISIN: IN0020170117, Scrip Code: 800277)
- Reason for suspension: Securities maturing pursuant to redemption dates fixed
- Notice reference: DR-763/2025-2026
- Issued by: Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance & Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational notice for securities reaching maturity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the mentioned securities from November 25, 2025
- Trading members should inform their clients holding these securities about the trading suspension
- Members should ensure proper settlement of any outstanding positions before the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **November 24, 2025**: Notice issue date
- **November 25, 2025**: Effective date of trading suspension
- **November 27, 2025**: Maturity date for both T-bills (182-day and 364-day)

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of these specific debt instruments. The trading suspension is a routine procedure for securities approaching maturity. Investors holding these T-bills and Sovereign Gold Bond will receive redemption proceeds as per the original terms. The suspension prevents new trading activity that could complicate settlement processes near maturity. Market liquidity for these specific instruments will cease from November 25, 2025, but this is expected and does not indicate broader market disruption.
