## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in debt securities of two companies - JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd and Hiren Wahen Buildtech Private Limited - effective November 27, 2025, as these debentures are reaching their maturity dates. Trading members are advised not to deal in these securities from the effective date.

## Key Points

- Two debt securities will be suspended from trading on BSE
- JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd debenture (SCRIP CODE: 975132, ISIN: INE265J07555) bearing 10.21% interest, maturing November 28, 2025
- Hiren Wahen Buildtech Private Limited debenture (SCRIP CODE: 975302, ISIN: INE0S1Q07019) bearing 19% interest, maturing November 30, 2025
- Trading suspension effective from November 27, 2025
- Notice reference: DR-765/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard operational notice regarding debt security maturity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the specified debentures from November 27, 2025 onwards
- Trading members should take note of the suspension and communicate to relevant stakeholders
- No new trades should be executed in these securities after the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **November 26, 2025**: Notice issued
- **November 27, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date
- **November 28, 2025**: Maturity date for JM Financial ARC debenture
- **November 30, 2025**: Maturity date for Hiren Wahen Buildtech debenture

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited and routine in nature. This affects only holders of these specific private placement debentures. The suspension is procedural due to upcoming maturity, and investors holding these securities will receive their principal and final interest payments on the respective maturity dates. No broader market impact is expected as these are private placement instruments with limited trading activity.
