## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The Rs. 39,950 crore SDL auction represents significant state government borrowing activity. The non-competitive bidding facility provides retail and smaller institutional investors access to state government securities alongside competitive bidders. This auction will impact state government debt markets and liquidity in the secondary SDL market.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members participating in debt markets need to coordinate bid submissions through the NCB-GSec module. The tight timeline between bid closure (December 30, 8:00 AM) and auction (December 30) requires operational readiness. Year-end settlement on December 31, 2025 may require additional coordination for fund management.

**Investor Impact**: The facility allows investors to participate in SDL auctions without competing on yield, ensuring allocation at the auction-determined rate. The wide range of maturities (2029-2046) and diverse state issuers provides portfolio diversification opportunities for debt investors.
