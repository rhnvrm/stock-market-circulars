title: 'Subdivision of Equity Shares of Unison Metals Ltd (Scrip Code: 538610)'
---

## Summary

Unison Metals Ltd (Scrip Code: 538610) has announced a subdivision of its equity shares with a record date of November 28, 2025. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs.10/- will be subdivided into ten equity shares with a face value of Re.1/- each. The subdivision will be effective from November 28, 2025, and the existing ISIN INE099D01018 will cease to be valid for transactions from that date.

## Key Points

- Company: Unison Metals Ltd (Scrip Code: 538610)
- Corporate action: Subdivision of equity shares
- Subdivision ratio: 1 equity share of Rs.10/- subdivided into 10 equity shares of Re.1/- each
- Record date: November 28, 2025
- Effective date: November 28, 2025
- Existing ISIN (Rs.10/-): INE099D01018 (will not be valid from November 28, 2025)
- New ISIN for Re.1/- paid-up shares to be announced separately
- Notice reference: DR-766/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action of share subdivision permitted under existing regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that ISIN INE099D01018 will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after November 28, 2025
- Members must await separate notice from BSE announcing the new ISIN number for Re.1/- paid-up shares
- All trading and settlement systems must be updated to reflect the new share structure post-subdivision
- Demat accounts will be automatically credited with subdivided shares in the ratio of 1:10

## Important Dates

- **October 31, 2025**: Circular issued by BSE
- **November 28, 2025**: Record date for subdivision
- **November 28, 2025**: Effective date - existing ISIN becomes invalid, new paid-up value of Re.1/- becomes effective

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The subdivision will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10 times while reducing the face value and likely the market price proportionately. This typically enhances liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors.

**Trading Impact**: Trading will continue uninterrupted, but the ISIN change requires system updates. Post-subdivision, the stock will trade at approximately one-tenth of its pre-subdivision price.

**Operational Impact**: Shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. No action is required from shareholders as the subdivision will be processed automatically in demat accounts. Market participants must await the new ISIN announcement before the effective date.
