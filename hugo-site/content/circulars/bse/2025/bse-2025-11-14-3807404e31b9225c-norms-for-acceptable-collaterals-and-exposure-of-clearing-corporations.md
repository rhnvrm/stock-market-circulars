## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - This is primarily an administrative update that affects the operational aspects of collateral management. Members using banking instruments as collateral from the eligible list will see no disruption.

**Operational Impact:** Members who may have collateral exposure through banks not on this list will need to restructure their collateral arrangements. This could involve transferring FDs, obtaining new Bank Guarantees, or adjusting cash placements to eligible institutions.

**Risk Management Impact:** The updated list ensures that only banks meeting SEBI's prescribed criteria are used for collateral purposes, enhancing the overall credit quality and risk profile of the clearing corporation's collateral base.
