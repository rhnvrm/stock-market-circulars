## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - This is a significant IPO listing with over 451 crore equity shares. The staggered lock-in expiry dates will impact share liquidity and trading volumes at different intervals. The immediate availability of 16.31 crore public shares and employee ESOP shares provides initial market liquidity.

**Liquidity Considerations**: Approximately 20.64 crore shares (AIF, ESOP, and IPO public) are immediately tradable without lock-in restrictions. Significant liquidity increases expected at lock-in expiry dates, particularly in December 2025 (306 crore shares) and June 2027 (93 crore shares).

**Corporate Action**: The merger and subsequent share extinguishment of over 406 crore shares represents a major corporate restructuring that consolidated the holding structure before the IPO.

**Investor Categories**: The circular demonstrates a diverse shareholder base including promoters, anchor investors, AIFs, employees, and public investors, each with different lock-in obligations reflecting their investment timing and category.
