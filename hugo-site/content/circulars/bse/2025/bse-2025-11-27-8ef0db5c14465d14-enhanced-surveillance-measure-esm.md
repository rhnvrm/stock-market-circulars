title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities List Update November 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an updated list of securities under the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework effective November 28, 2025. The circular adds new securities to ESM, moves certain securities to higher ESM stages, and provides a consolidated list of all securities currently under various ESM stages. No securities are being removed from the ESM framework in this update.

## Key Points

- 2 new securities added to ESM framework: Capital Trade Links Ltd (538476) and SVP Global Textiles Ltd (505590)
- 1 security moving to higher ESM stage: Omnitex Industries India Ltd (514324)
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages
- No securities exiting the ESM framework
- Consolidated list includes 29+ securities under ESM Stage I and Stage II
- Changes effective from November 28, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework continues to apply graduated surveillance levels to securities that meet specific criteria. Securities under ESM are subject to additional trading restrictions and monitoring based on their assigned stage (I, II, etc.). The framework aims to protect investor interests by identifying securities with unusual price movements or volatility patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the updated ESM status of listed securities
- Securities in ESM framework may be subject to additional margin requirements
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance status when trading these securities
- Securities marked with asterisk (*) are as per NSE classification
- SME scrips are specifically marked with hash (#)

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 28, 2025 - All ESM changes take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to investors and traders of the specific securities listed under ESM. The 2 new additions and 1 upward stage movement indicate continued regulatory monitoring of these securities due to volatility or other surveillance triggers.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ESM typically face additional scrutiny, potential margin increases, and may experience reduced liquidity as some investors avoid securities under surveillance measures.

**Investor Impact**: Existing and prospective investors in these securities should exercise additional caution and be aware of the heightened regulatory oversight. ESM classification often indicates price volatility or other concerns that warrant enhanced monitoring.
