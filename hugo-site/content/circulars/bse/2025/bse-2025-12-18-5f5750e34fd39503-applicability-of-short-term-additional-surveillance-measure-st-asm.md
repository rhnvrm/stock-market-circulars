## Regulatory Framework

The Short Term ASM framework is a surveillance mechanism implemented by BSE to monitor securities showing abnormal price movements or unusual trading patterns over short time periods (5/15/30 days). Securities under this framework may face:

- Enhanced surveillance and monitoring
- Potential trading restrictions
- Staged approach (Stage I being the initial level)
- Possible escalation to Long Term ASM or other restrictive frameworks

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 19, 2025
- **Circular Date**: December 18, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The ST-ASM framework affects liquidity and trading in specified securities. Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance measures.

**Investor Impact**: Securities under ST-ASM may experience reduced trading volumes and increased scrutiny. Some securities transitioning to LT-ASM face more stringent long-term surveillance.

**Compliance Impact**: Trading members and market participants must ensure compliance with ASM framework requirements for affected securities, including potential margin requirements and position limits.
