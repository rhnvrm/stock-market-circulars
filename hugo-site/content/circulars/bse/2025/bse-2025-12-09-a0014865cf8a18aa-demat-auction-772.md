## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects trading members and clients with short delivery positions in 107 scrips. The auction mechanism helps ensure settlement integrity.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and clearing members with positions in these securities must arrange for auction participation, which may involve additional costs (auction charges and price differential).

**Liquidity Impact:** Securities with higher auction quantities (like SPRIGHT AGRO with 258,928 shares, CENTRAL BANK with 10,000 shares) may experience temporary price pressure during auction settlement.

**Client Impact:** Clients who failed to deliver securities on settlement date will be subject to auction purchases at potentially higher prices, resulting in financial loss equal to the difference between contract price and auction price plus applicable charges.
