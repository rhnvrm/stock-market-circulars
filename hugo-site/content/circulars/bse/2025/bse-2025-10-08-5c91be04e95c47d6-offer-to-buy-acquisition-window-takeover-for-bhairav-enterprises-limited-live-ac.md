## Impact Assessment

This takeover offer has limited market-wide impact as it is specific to Bhairav Enterprises Limited shareholders. The offer size of 2,60,000 shares represents a relatively small acquisition. The impact is primarily on:

1. **Existing Shareholders**: Opportunity to exit at Rs. 19.00 per share (premium of Rs. 9.00 over face value)
2. **Trading Members**: Need to facilitate client participation through OTB module
3. **Market Operations**: Standard OTB window operations with no changes to existing processes

The offer provides liquidity to existing shareholders and follows established regulatory framework for takeover offers through acquisition window mechanism.
