## Summary

Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (BSE Scrip Code: 505537) submitted a clarification to BSE on December 3, 2025, regarding a news article published in Economic Times about layoffs following the failed Sony merger. The company confirmed that workforce optimization is part of an ongoing organizational restructuring to create a more agile structure. The company referenced a prior April 5, 2024 press release where it had announced plans to rationalize workforce by 15% across the company over a period.

- Organizational restructuring aims to create more agile and collaborative structure with sharper focus on goals and performance
- Company states optimization is ongoing based on business dynamics with no impact on operations/performance
- Workforce rationalization of 15% was previously announced on April 5, 2024
- Company confirms compliance with SEBI LODR 2015 disclosure requirements

## Compliance Requirements

- Company confirms ongoing compliance with Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015
- Commits to continue making disclosures in accordance with regulatory requirements

## Important Dates

- December 2, 2025: BSE sought clarification (reference L/SURV/ONL/RV/APJ/(2025-2026)/95)

- April 5, 2024: Original press release announcing 15% workforce rationalization

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Company claims no impact on operations or performance from the workforce optimization exercise. The restructuring is positioned as strategic efficiency improvement rather than distress-driven cost cutting.

**Market Impact:** Medium - involves major listed media company addressing market concerns about post-merger failure restructuring. The clarification attempts to frame layoffs as planned optimization rather than reactive measures to business deterioration.

**Investor Consideration:** Investors should note the company's assertion that workforce reduction was pre-announced in April 2024 and is part of planned restructuring, though the timing following the failed Sony merger raises questions about whether business dynamics have accelerated the timeline or scope of cuts.
