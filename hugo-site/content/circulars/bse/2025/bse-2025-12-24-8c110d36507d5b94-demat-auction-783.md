**Operational Impact:** Low to Medium - Affects trading members with outstanding delivery obligations in the listed 99 scrips

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal - Quantities are relatively small for most scrips except Standard Capital Markets (186,863 shares), Baba Arts (36,863 shares), UR Sugar Industries (25,688 shares), and Deccan Gold (22,411 shares).
