Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- No dealings permitted from December 5, 2025
- Record date set as December 6, 2025
- Notice issued under reference DR-771/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action notification for debt securities redemption and interest payment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealing in the specified debentures from December 5, 2025
- Trading members must inform their clients holding these debentures about the suspension
- No buy or sell transactions to be executed in these securities during the suspension period

## Important Dates

- **December 5, 2025**: Trading suspension begins (no dealings from this date)
- **December 6, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of these specific NCD series. The trading suspension is temporary and procedural in nature, necessary to determine eligible debenture holders for redemption and interest payment.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will not be able to trade these securities from December 5, 2025. Investors on record as of December 6, 2025 will receive the redemption proceeds and/or interest payment. The 9.21% series will receive both redemption and interest, while the 9.60% series will receive redemption only.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to block trades in these debentures and communicate with affected clients regarding the suspension and upcoming corporate actions.
