title: Resumption of Subscription in Fresh Subscriptions of Invesco Mutual Fund
---

## Summary

Invesco Mutual Fund has revoked the temporary suspension of subscriptions in three overseas fund of fund schemes that was imposed on October 9, 2025. Effective December 5, 2025, the fund will resume accepting lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh registrations for Systematic Investment Plans (SIP), Systematic Transfer Plans (STP), and IDCW Transfer Plans in the designated schemes. Subscriptions will be allowed only up to the available headroom without breaching overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022 at the fund level.

## Key Points

- Resumption of subscriptions effective from December 5, 2025
- Applies to three specific schemes: Invesco India - Invesco Global Equity Income Fund of Fund, Invesco India - Invesco Pan European Equity Fund of Fund, and Invesco India - Invesco Global Consumer Trends Fund of Fund
- Subscriptions allowed through lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh SIP/STP/IDCW Transfer Plan registrations
- Subscriptions permitted only within available headroom to comply with overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022
- AMC reserves right to re-suspend subscriptions if overseas investment limits are approached
- Notice dated December 3, 2025 issued by Saurabh Nanavati, Managing Director and CEO

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This notice revokes a previous temporary suspension imposed on October 9, 2025. The resumption is subject to compliance with existing overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022 at the fund level.

## Compliance Requirements

- Invesco Asset Management must monitor overseas investment levels to ensure compliance with February 1, 2022 limits
- The AMC must suspend subscriptions again if overseas investment limits are approached
- All other terms and conditions of the Scheme Information Documents (SIDs) and Key Information Memorandums (KIMs) remain unchanged
- This notice forms an integral part of the SIDs/KIMs of the designated schemes

## Important Dates

- **December 3, 2025**: Notice issued
- **December 5, 2025**: Effective date for resumption of subscriptions
- **October 9, 2025**: Date when original suspension was imposed (referenced)
- **February 1, 2022**: Reference date for overseas investment limits

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is an administrative action affecting only three specific overseas fund of fund schemes within Invesco Mutual Fund's portfolio.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for investors interested in these three global equity schemes, as they can now make fresh investments through various modes. However, the resumption is conditional and may be suspended again if investment limits are approached.

**Operational Impact**: Invesco Asset Management will need to actively monitor overseas investment levels and headroom availability to ensure compliance with the February 1, 2022 limits and may need to implement controls to prevent breaches.
