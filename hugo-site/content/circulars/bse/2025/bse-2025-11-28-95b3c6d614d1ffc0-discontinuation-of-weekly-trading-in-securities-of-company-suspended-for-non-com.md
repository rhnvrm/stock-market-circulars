## Summary

BSE announced the discontinuation of weekly trade-for-trade facility for Seven Hill Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 511760) effective December 16, 2025. This follows the completion of the mandated six-month period during which the company's shares were allowed to trade only on the first trading day of every week in Z group on a trade-for-trade basis, after being suspended for non-compliance with SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 2018.

## Key Points

- Six-month mandated period as per SEBI Master Circular has been completed
- This action is pursuant to SEBI's Standard Operating Procedure for suspension and revocation of equity shares
- Trading facility was provided on Trade for Trade basis in Z group only

This circular implements the final stage of the suspension process outlined in SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024 (Chapter-VII(A) - Penal Actions for Non-Compliance). After the mandated six-month weekly trading period expires, the facility is discontinued entirely.
