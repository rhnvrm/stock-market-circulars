  Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has implemented XBRL-based filing for Regulation 50 disclosures pursuant to SEBI's December 13, 2024 amendment to LODR Regulations. All entities with listed non-convertible securities must submit Regulation 50 disclosures exclusively in XBRL format effective December 1, 2025. An Excel utility and user manual have been made available on the BSE Listing Centre portal. Submissions in any other format, including PDF, will be treated as non-submission.

## Key Points

- XBRL format mandatory for Regulation 50 disclosures from December 1, 2025
- Excel utility available on BSE Listing Centre portal under Listing Compliance > XBRL > Excel Utility > Regulation 50
- Common XBRL taxonomy implemented across exchanges for uniformity
- Off-line Excel utility with validation feature provided for ease of compliance
- PDF or other format submissions will be treated as non-submission
- User manual annexed with step-by-step instructions
- Submissions visible under reports section on Listing Centre Portal
- Post-submission intimations disseminated on company's Get Quote page

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI amended Regulation 50 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 on December 13, 2024, mandating listed entities to make disclosures under Regulation 50 in XBRL format in accordance with guidelines specified by stock exchanges. BSE has now operationalized this requirement by providing the necessary infrastructure and utilities.

## Compliance Requirements

**Applicable to:** All entities which have listed non-convertible securities

**Filing Process:**
1. Download Excel utility for 'Regulation 50 Prior Intimation of Meeting for Debt' from BSE Listing Centre (https://listing.bseindia.com/xbrl.aspx)
2. Fill required details in the utility offline and validate
3. Generate XML file after successful validation
4. Upload XML file via Listing Centre: Listing Compliance > XBRL > E-Filing > select 'Regulation 50 Prior Intimation of Meeting for Debt'
5. Select type of submission, validate, and upload file
6. Download acknowledgement copy from reports section

**Important:** Only XBRL format accepted; submissions in PDF or other formats will be treated as non-submission

**Support:** For queries, contact debt.compliance@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **December 13, 2024:** SEBI amendment to Regulation 50 mandating XBRL filing
- **November 21, 2025:** BSE circular issued (Notice No 20251121-72)
- **December 1, 2025:** Effective date - XBRL-only submission requirement comes into force

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** High - Entities must transition from current filing methods to XBRL format, requiring familiarization with new Excel utility and XML generation process.

**Compliance Impact:** Critical - Non-compliance or submission in wrong format will be treated as non-submission, potentially triggering regulatory penalties under LODR Regulations.

**Technology Impact:** Moderate - While offline Excel utility eases technical burden, entities need to establish processes for XBRL validation and XML file generation.

**Market Impact:** Low - Administrative change with no direct market trading impact, but enhances data standardization and regulatory oversight of debt securities.

**Timeline Pressure:** Moderate - Ten-day implementation window (November 21 to December 1, 2025) requires immediate action by affected entities to update internal processes and train personnel.
