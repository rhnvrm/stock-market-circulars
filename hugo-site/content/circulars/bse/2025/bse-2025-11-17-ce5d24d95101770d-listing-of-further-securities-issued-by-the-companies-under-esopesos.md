- **Notice Date**: November 17, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date**: November 18, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. ESOP listings are routine corporate actions representing employee compensation. The share quantities represent minor dilution for most companies relative to their existing share capital.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact expected as ESOP shares are typically held by employees rather than immediately traded.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may experience marginal dilution, but this is expected corporate behavior for companies with active employee incentive programs.

**Notable**: SBFC Finance's 2.65 million shares and Suzlon Energy's 1.93 million shares are the largest issuances and may warrant monitoring for any significant trading activity post-listing.
