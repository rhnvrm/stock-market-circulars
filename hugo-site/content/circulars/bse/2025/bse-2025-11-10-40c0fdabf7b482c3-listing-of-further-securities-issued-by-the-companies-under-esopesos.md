## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. These are routine ESOP/ESOS listings representing employee compensation exercises. The total number of shares (902,324) is relatively small and spread across seven companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible immediate impact on stock liquidity. Most shares have no lock-in period, though the quantities are modest relative to typical trading volumes.

**Corporate Impact**: Positive for employee retention and compensation. Reflects companies exercising standard employee benefit programs.

**Investor Consideration**: Marginal dilution effect on existing shareholders, but this is typical corporate governance practice for employee compensation and typically already factored into market expectations.
