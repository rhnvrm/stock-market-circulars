## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification with limited market impact. The preferential allotment increases the total share capital of Vikram Kamats Hospitality Limited by 13,60,000 shares. The lock-in period until June 30, 2026 ensures these shares will not be available for sale in the market for approximately six months, limiting immediate liquidity impact. The shares being issued to non-promoters may result in minor dilution of existing shareholding.
