## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects liquidity in SLB segment for nine securities during their respective shut periods.

**Operational Impact**: Investors participating in SLB must plan position closures in advance to avoid forced foreclosure. The staggered dates provide time for systematic unwinding of positions.

**Investor Impact**: Borrowers lose the opportunity to receive corporate action benefits unless they close their short positions. Lenders will have their securities recalled to enable them to receive dividends or bonus shares as eligible shareholders on record date.
