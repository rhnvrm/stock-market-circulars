- Trading holidays on November 1-2, 2025 noted in the margin schedule
- Minimum delivery margin of 25% applies on expiry date

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational circular providing margin schedules for commodity derivatives during tender periods.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants holding positions in GOLD, GOLDM, or SILVER futures expiring November 5 must maintain escalating margins from October 30 onwards

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects all participants holding commodity futures positions in gold and silver contracts approaching expiry.

**Operational Impact:** Traders need to plan for increased margin requirements during tender periods, which may affect position management and cash flow. The escalating margin structure encourages early position squaring or rollover to avoid higher margin blocking. Market liquidity may be affected as margins increase, particularly for participants with limited capital.
