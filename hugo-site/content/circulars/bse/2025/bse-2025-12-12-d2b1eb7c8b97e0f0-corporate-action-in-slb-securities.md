## Impact Assessment

This circular directly impacts participants in the Securities Lending and Borrowing segment who hold positions in the affected securities. Market participants must ensure timely closure of positions to avoid forced square-offs. The shut periods temporarily restrict liquidity in the SLB market for these specific securities. The foreclosure mechanism ensures orderly settlement before corporate action execution dates.
