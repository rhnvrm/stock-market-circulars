The adjustment will be processed end of day on January 01, 2026, with the ex-date being January 02, 2026. The company is subdividing one equity share of Rs. 10 each into five equity shares of Rs. 2 each, resulting in a 5:1 split ratio and an adjustment factor of 5.

## Key Points

- Stock split ratio: 5:1 (one share of Rs. 10 becomes five shares of Rs. 2)
- Adjustment factor: 5
- Record Date: January 02, 2026
- Ex-Date: January 02, 2026
- Adjustment processing: End of day on January 01, 2026
- Scrip Code: 534091
- Derivatives Asset Code: MCXL
- Existing market lot: 125 shares
- Revised market lot: 625 shares (125 × 5)

## Regulatory Changes

Adjustments are being made in compliance with SEBI guidelines for adjustment of Futures & Options contracts on announcement of corporate actions. The Exchange will make necessary adjustments for all available Futures & Options contracts on the underlying scrip MCXL.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Understand the adjustment factor of 5 and its application to existing positions
- Update systems and records to reflect adjusted strike prices, market lots, and positions
- Contact designated Relationship Managers for clarifications

**Adjustment Calculations:**

1. **Strike Price**: Divide old strike price by adjustment factor (5)
   - Example: 10,300 becomes 2,060; 10,400 becomes 2,080; 10,500 becomes 2,100; 10,600 becomes 2,120

2. **Market Lot**: Multiply old market lot by adjustment factor (5)
   - 125 shares × 5 = 625 shares

3. **Position**: Multiply old position by adjustment factor (5)

4. **Futures Price**: Divide old futures price by adjustment factor (5), rounded to nearest tick size

## Important Dates

- **January 01, 2026**: Adjustments processed at end of day
- **January 02, 2026**: Record Date for stock split and ex-date for F&O adjustments

## Impact Assessment
