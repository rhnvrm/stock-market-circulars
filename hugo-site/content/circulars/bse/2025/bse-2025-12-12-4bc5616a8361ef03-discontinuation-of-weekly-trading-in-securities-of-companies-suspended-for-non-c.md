title: Discontinuation of Weekly Trading for Suspended Companies - Longview Tea and
  Seacoast Shipping
---

## Summary

BSE will discontinue the weekly trading facility for two companies - Longview Tea Company Ltd (Scrip Code: 526568) and Seacoast Shipping Services Ltd (Scrip Code: 542753) - effective December 30, 2025. These companies were previously suspended for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations and had been allowed limited trading on a Trade for Trade basis in Z group only on the first trading day of each week. The six-month period mandated under SEBI's Standard Operating Procedure has now been completed, leading to complete discontinuation of trading.

## Key Points

- Two companies affected: Longview Tea Company Ltd and Seacoast Shipping Services Ltd
- Weekly trading facility will be discontinued from December 30, 2025
- Companies were suspended for non-compliance with SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015
- Previously allowed Trade for Trade trading in Z group on first trading day of every week
- Six-month period for limited trading has been completed
- Action follows SEBI Master Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements Chapter-VII(A) of SEBI's Standard Operating Procedure for suspension and revocation of equity shares. The discontinuation follows the completion of the mandatory six-month period during which suspended companies are allowed limited weekly trading before potential delisting actions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must cease trading in the affected securities after December 30, 2025
- No trading will be permitted in these securities on any basis after the discontinuation date
- Companies remain suspended for non-compliance with LODR Regulations
- For clarifications, market participants should contact: bse.soplodr@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 12, 2025
- **Discontinuation Effective Date**: December 30, 2025
- **Reference to Previous Notice**: May 07, 2025 (Notice No. 20250507-16)
- **SEBI Master Circular Reference**: November 11, 2024

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Shareholders of Longview Tea Company Ltd and Seacoast Shipping Services Ltd will lose the limited weekly trading window, eliminating their ability to exit positions. This creates complete illiquidity for these securities.

**Market Impact**: The discontinuation signals progression toward potential compulsory delisting, as per SEBI's Standard Operating Procedure for non-compliant entities.

**Regulatory Significance**: This action demonstrates the enforcement mechanism for LODR compliance, where persistent non-compliance leads to progressively restrictive trading measures and eventual market exit.

**Next Steps**: Companies must achieve compliance with LODR Regulations to seek revocation of suspension. Without compliance, they face compulsory delisting procedures.
