## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of DBL INFRA ASSETS PRIVATE LIMITED effective November 12, 2025. The suspension follows the company's notification to the exchange regarding early redemption of its 13% NCDs originally scheduled to mature on August 28, 2026. Trading members are advised to cease all dealing in the specified debentures.

## Key Points

- DBL INFRA ASSETS PRIVATE LIMITED has opted for early redemption of its Non-Convertible Debentures
- Affected Security: DBLIPL-13%-28-8-26-PVT (ISIN: INE0IJE08011, Scrip Code: 973405)
- Trading suspension effective from November 12, 2025
- Trading members must not deal in the specified debentures from the effective date
- Notice issued under reference DR-754/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all trading activities in the specified debentures from November 12, 2025
- Trading members are required to take note of this suspension and communicate to relevant stakeholders
- No new trades should be executed in ISIN INE0IJE08011 (Scrip Code: 973405)

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 11, 2025
- **Trading Suspension Effective Date**: November 12, 2025
- **Original Maturity Date**: August 28, 2026 (now being redeemed early)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to specific debenture holders of DBL INFRA ASSETS PRIVATE LIMITED. As these are privately placed NCDs with relatively low liquidity, broader debt market impact is minimal.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will receive early redemption proceeds instead of holding until the original August 2026 maturity. This may affect investors' fixed income portfolio planning and reinvestment strategies.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to block trading in the specified scrip code and ISIN to ensure compliance with the suspension directive.
