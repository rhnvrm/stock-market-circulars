## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact. This is a company-specific event affecting Hari Govind International Ltd. only. The preferential issue represents a modest equity dilution with shares issued at par value. The lock-in period until May 30, 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure. Trading members dealing with this scrip need to be aware of the lock-in restrictions on the new shares. Overall impact on broader market operations is minimal.
