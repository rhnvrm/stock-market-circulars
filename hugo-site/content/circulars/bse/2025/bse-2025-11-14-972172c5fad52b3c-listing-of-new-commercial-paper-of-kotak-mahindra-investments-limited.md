## Impact Assessment

This is a low-impact routine listing of short-term debt instruments. The 7-day Commercial Paper provides short-term financing for Kotak Mahindra Investments Limited. Impact is limited to debt market participants and institutional investors dealing in private placement securities. The high credit ratings (A1+) indicate strong creditworthiness and low default risk. No material impact on equity markets or broader market operations expected.
