## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing following warrant conversion under preferential allotment. The shares are subject to lock-in periods ranging from approximately 6 months to 18 months from the notice date, which will restrict immediate selling pressure.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the increased share capital. The new shares represent a dilution event but are issued to existing promoters and select non-promoters.

**Investor Impact**: The lock-in schedule indicates 80,96,067 shares (approximately 77.5% of the allotment) are locked until May 23, 2027, suggesting long-term commitment from allottees. The remaining shares have shorter lock-in periods ending May 23, 2026.
