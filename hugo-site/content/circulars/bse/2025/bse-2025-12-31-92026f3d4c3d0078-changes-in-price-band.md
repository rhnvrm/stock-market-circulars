---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 8 securities effective January 1, 2026. The revisions include both tightening and relaxing of price band limits, ranging from 2% (most restrictive) to 20% (less restrictive). Trading members are required to note these changes for trade execution and risk management purposes.

## Key Points

- 8 securities subject to revised price bands effective January 1, 2026
- BCL Enterprises Ltd: 5% price band
- Getalong Enterprise Ltd: 5% price band
- L. T. Elevator Ltd: 5% price band
- Natura Hue Chem Ltd: 2% price band (most restrictive)
- Norben Tea & Exports Ltd: 2% price band (most restrictive)
- Shipwaves Online Ltd: 10% price band
- Soma Textiles & Industries Ltd: 2% price band (most restrictive)
- Unisem Agritech Ltd: 20% price band (most relaxed)
- Notice issued by BSE Surveillance Department

## Regulatory Changes

Price band mechanisms serve as circuit breakers to control excessive volatility in securities trading. The revised bands indicate different levels of surveillance:

- **2% band** (Natura Hue Chem, Norben Tea & Exports, Soma Textiles): Strictest control, limiting daily price movement to ±2%
- **5% band** (BCL Enterprises, Getalong Enterprise, L. T. Elevator): Moderate control
- **10% band** (Shipwaves Online): Standard control
- **20% band** (Unisem Agritech): Relaxed control, allowing wider price movement

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their trading systems to reflect new price band limits
- All trades in affected securities must comply with revised price bands from January 1, 2026
- Members should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com for clarifications
- Risk management systems must be recalibrated for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 31, 2025
- **Effective Date**: January 1, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revised price bands will affect intraday trading volatility for the 8 specified securities. Tighter bands (2%) may reduce liquidity and increase rejection of orders outside the band, while the 20% band for Unisem Agritech allows for greater price discovery.

**Trading Impact**: Traders and market makers need to adjust their strategies and order placement systems. Securities with 2% bands will have limited arbitrage opportunities and may experience order queuing at band limits.

**Surveillance Rationale**: The varying levels of price bands suggest different risk profiles - securities with tighter bands may be under enhanced surveillance due to concerns about manipulation, volatility, or other market integrity issues.
