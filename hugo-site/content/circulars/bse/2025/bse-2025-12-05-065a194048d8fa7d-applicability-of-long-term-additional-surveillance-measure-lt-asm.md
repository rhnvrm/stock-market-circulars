title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective December 08, 2025. The circular covers: 3 new securities entering LT-ASM, 1 security moving to a higher surveillance stage, 5 securities moving to lower stages, and 27 securities exiting the framework entirely. The LT-ASM framework imposes additional surveillance and trading restrictions on securities that meet specific risk criteria.

## Key Points

- 3 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM: Nectar Lifesciences Ltd, Ortin Global Ltd, and Rajdarshan Industries Ltd
- Beryl Securities Ltd moves from Stage I to Stage II (higher surveillance)
- 5 securities moved to lower surveillance stages: CIAN Agro (to Stage III), KIOCL Limited (to Stage II), Omnipotent Industries (to Stage I), Sri Adhikari Brothers Television (to Stage I)
- 27 securities moving out of LT-ASM framework completely, including Ashram Online.Com, Beryl Drugs, Bharatrohan Airborne Innovations, and others
- No securities placed directly into Stage IV LT-ASM
- Changes apply to both regular and T+0 scrips where applicable
- Asterisk (*) denotes securities aligned with NSE surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework continues BSE's enhanced surveillance mechanism for securities exhibiting abnormal price movements, high volatility, or other risk parameters. Securities in LT-ASM face:
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Price bands and trading restrictions
- Higher margins for trading
- Staged approach (I through IV) with progressively stricter measures

Movement between stages is based on ongoing monitoring of trading patterns and compliance metrics.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised ASM classifications before trading these securities
- Trading members should update their risk management systems to reflect new stage assignments
- Investors in affected securities should be aware of applicable price bands, margin requirements, and settlement conditions
- Brokers must ensure clients are informed about surveillance status of these securities
- Securities exiting LT-ASM will return to normal trading conditions but may still be subject to other surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 08, 2025 - All changes to LT-ASM classifications become applicable
- **Circular Date:** December 05, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High impact on 35+ securities across multiple sectors. Securities entering or moving to higher surveillance stages will face reduced liquidity due to stricter trading conditions and higher margins, potentially leading to wider bid-ask spreads. Securities exiting the framework should see improved liquidity and reduced trading costs.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding positions in securities moving to higher stages should expect increased margin requirements and potential difficulty in execution. Those in securities exiting LT-ASM will benefit from normalized trading conditions. New entrants to LT-ASM (Nectar Lifesciences, Ortin Global, Rajdarshan Industries) may see immediate price volatility as market participants adjust positions.

**Operational Impact:** Trading systems and risk management platforms must be updated to reflect new classifications. Brokers need to adjust margin calculations and client communications for affected securities.
