## Summary

Chandrima Mercantiles Ltd (Scrip Code: 540829) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of Rs.10 face value will be sub-divided into ten equity shares of Re.1 face value each, with the record date set for August 20, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Chandrima Mercantiles Ltd (Scrip Code: 540829)
- Record Date: August 20, 2025
- Sub-division ratio: 1 equity share of Rs.10 becomes 10 equity shares of Re.1 each
- New paid-up value: Re.1 per share
- Effective date: August 20, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE371F01016) for Rs.10 shares will become invalid from August 20, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE371F01016 for Rs.10 paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after August 20, 2025. A new ISIN number for Re.1 paid-up shares will be communicated through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must be aware of the share sub-division and ensure proper handling of transactions post the record date. The company has set the record date for dematerialized securities under rolling settlement.

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: August 20, 2025
- **Effective Date**: August 20, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This corporate action will increase the number of outstanding shares by a factor of 10 while proportionally reducing the face value. Shareholders will receive 10 shares of Re.1 each for every 1 share of Rs.10 held. The action may improve liquidity and make shares more accessible to retail investors due to lower absolute share price.
