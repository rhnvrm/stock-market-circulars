**Market Impact**: Minimal. The preferential allotment represents a relatively small number of shares issued to promoters with a long lock-in period, limiting immediate market liquidity impact.

**Promoter Holding Impact**: Increases promoter stake through warrant conversion, demonstrating promoter confidence in the company.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible near-term impact as all shares are locked-in until June 2027, preventing any selling pressure.

**Investor Consideration**: Standard corporate action with no immediate trading implications for existing shareholders. The warrant conversion was pre-disclosed and follows regulatory requirements.
