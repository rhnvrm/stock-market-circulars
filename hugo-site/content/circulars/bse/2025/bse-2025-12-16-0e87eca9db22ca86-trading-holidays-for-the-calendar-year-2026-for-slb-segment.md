## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The holiday schedule affects all SLB segment participants and requires advance planning for securities lending and borrowing activities. The distribution of holidays throughout the year impacts liquidity planning and settlement cycles.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to incorporate these holidays into their operational calendars, risk management systems, and client communication. The special Muhurat Trading session on November 8, 2026 requires separate operational preparation.

**Planning Considerations:** With holidays spread across the year and several occurring mid-week, market participants should plan their SLB transactions accounting for extended non-trading periods, particularly around festival clusters in October-November 2026.
