## Impact Assessment

This circular has moderate impact on market participants engaged in Securities Lending and Borrowing activities for the two specified securities. SLB participants must take timely action to close positions or face forced closure on the foreclosure dates. The shut periods will temporarily suspend SLB activity in these securities, potentially affecting liquidity and trading strategies. Participants relying on borrowed shares for short positions or lenders expecting continued income must adjust their positions accordingly before the shut periods commence.
