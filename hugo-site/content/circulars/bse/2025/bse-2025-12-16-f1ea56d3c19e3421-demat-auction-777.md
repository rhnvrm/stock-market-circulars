Quantities range from 1 share to 82,943 shares depending on the security. This is a standard settlement mechanism to address delivery failures in the market.

## Key Points

- Demat auction for Settlement No. 777 scheduled for December 16, 2025
- Covers 85+ securities with delivery shortages

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Buyers in the auction must fulfill payment obligations as per BSE settlement timelines

- Settlement obligations must be met to avoid penalties and further auctions

## Important Dates

- **Auction Date**: December 16, 2025
- **Settlement No.**: 777

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects multiple securities across sectors. While auction quantities are relatively small for most scrips, the presence of high-value stocks and some large quantities (Franklin Industries: 82,943 shares, SpiceJet: 25,000 shares) could cause localized price volatility during auction.

**Operational Impact**: Standard settlement procedure. Brokers with shortages face potential increased costs if auction prices exceed market prices. Investors in affected scrips may experience temporary price fluctuations. The wide range of securities (85+ scrips) indicates broader delivery issues in the settlement cycle, though most quantities are manageable.

**Investor Impact**: Limited direct impact unless investors are part of the settlement chain. May cause temporary price movements in affected securities during auction hours.
