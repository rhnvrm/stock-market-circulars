## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This OFS is being conducted in compliance with existing regulations:

- Rule 9(2)(b) of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 (as amended)
- Regulation 38 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended)
- SEBI Master Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/ dated November 11, 2024 prescribing permissible methods for achieving minimum public shareholding

## Compliance Requirements

- **Seller's Broker**: Must execute the OFS transaction through BSE's designated separate window
- **Bidders/Investors**: Required to read the Notice in its entirety along with OFS Guidelines before participating
- **Stock Exchange (BSE)**: Designated exchange for order placement
- **Clearing**: Indian Clearing Corporation Limited designated as clearing corporation
- **Notice Requirements**: Issued per paragraph 19.1.5.2 of Chapter I of SEBI OFS Circular

## Important Dates

- **December 26, 2025**: Notice issued to BSE
- **December 29, 2025 (T Day)**: First day of OFS - Non-Retail Investors only
- **December 30, 2025 (T+1 Day)**: Second day of OFS - Retail Investors and non-Retail Investors with unallotted bids from T Day

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The OFS will introduce 7,38,711 shares (5% of equity capital) into the public market, potentially increasing liquidity and public float. This is a regulatory compliance-driven sale rather than a distress sale, which should moderate negative sentiment.

**Shareholding Impact**: Post-OFS, the promoter's shareholding will reduce by 5%, while public shareholding will increase correspondingly to meet minimum public shareholding norms.

**Investor Categories**: The two-day structure allows non-retail investors first access on T Day, with retail investors participating on T+1 Day along with non-retail investors carrying forward unallotted bids. This tiered approach balances institutional and retail participation.

**Price Impact**: OFS transactions typically occur at a discount to prevailing market prices to attract buyers. Short-term price pressure may exist, but the regulatory nature and limited size (5%) should limit sustained negative impact.

**Compliance Achievement**: The OFS represents a prescribed method for achieving minimum public shareholding requirements, demonstrating the company's commitment to regulatory compliance and good corporate governance.
