## Important Dates

- **17th December 2025**: Notice date
- **19th December 2025**: Record date for determining shareholder entitlement
- **19th December 2025**: Ex-entitlement date (Settlement No. DR-781/2025-2026)
- **19th December 2025**: Transfer to 'T' group effective date
- **19th December 2025**: Special Pre-open Session (SPOS) applicable
- Listing date for resulting companies: To be announced subject to compliance with formalities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - This is a significant corporate restructuring involving complete separation of two major business verticals (Chemical and Rayon) of DCM Shriram Industries. The transfer to 'T' group indicates restricted trading, which typically results in reduced liquidity and price discovery only through call auction mechanism on the record date.

**Shareholder Impact**: High - All shareholders will automatically receive shares in two new listed entities in addition to their existing holdings, effectively tripling their holdings across three companies (original plus two new entities). The 1:1 ratio is highly favorable and straightforward.

**Operational Impact**: High - Creation of two independent listed entities allows each business vertical to operate independently with dedicated management focus, potentially unlocking value. The Chemical and Rayon businesses will have separate capital structures and strategic flexibility.

**Trading Impact**: Trading will be restricted to call auction/SPOS on 19th December 2025, which may result in higher volatility and price discovery challenges on that day. Normal trading is expected to resume post-demerger implementation.
