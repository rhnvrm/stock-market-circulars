## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. Mock trading sessions are conducted on Saturdays when regular trading is not active.

**Operational Impact:** Low to medium for trading members who choose to participate. The advance schedule allows members to plan their system testing activities and resource allocation for the year ahead. Members can use these sessions to test their trading systems, connectivity, and disaster recovery procedures in a controlled environment without affecting live trading.
