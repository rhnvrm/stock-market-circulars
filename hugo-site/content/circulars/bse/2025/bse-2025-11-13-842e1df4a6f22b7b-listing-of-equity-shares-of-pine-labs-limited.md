## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
The listing of Pine Labs Limited represents a significant market event with a unique shareholding pattern showing complete public ownership from the outset. The absence of promoter holding is unusual for Indian listed companies and indicates either a complete exit by original promoters or a professional investor-backed structure.

**Liquidity Considerations:**
With 216,316 public shareholders and 100% free float, the stock is expected to have high liquidity. The large shareholder base suggests broad-based institutional and retail participation.

**Dilution Risk:**
Investors should note the presence of 58,860,705 shares underlying outstanding convertible securities (approximately 5.12% of current paid-up capital), which could lead to dilution upon conversion. Additionally, outstanding ESOPs may result in further dilution.

**Governance Structure:**
The zero promoter holding structure suggests Pine Labs operates under a professional management model without traditional promoter control, which may appeal to investors seeking governance transparency.
