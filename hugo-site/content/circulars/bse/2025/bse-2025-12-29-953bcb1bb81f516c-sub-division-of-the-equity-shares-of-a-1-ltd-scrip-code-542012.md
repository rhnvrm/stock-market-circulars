title: 'Sub-Division of Equity Shares of A-1 Ltd (Scrip Code: 542012)'
---

## Summary

A-1 Ltd (Scrip Code: 542012) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs.10/- will be split into ten equity shares of Re.1/- each. The record date for this sub-division is January 8, 2026, and the change will be effective from the same date. The existing ISIN (INE911Z01017) for Rs.10/- shares will cease to be valid for exchange transactions from January 8, 2026, and a new ISIN for Re.1/- shares will be announced separately.

## Key Points

- Company: A-1 Ltd (Scrip Code: 542012)
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Split Ratio: 1:10 (One share of Rs.10/- into Ten shares of Re.1/-)
- New Face Value: Re.1/- per equity share
- Segment: Equity (Dematerialised Securities - Rolling Settlement)
- Notice Reference: DR-794/2025-2026
- Issued by: Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance & Operations

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN number INE911Z01017 (for Rs.10/- paid-up shares) will not be valid for transactions conducted on the Exchange on or after January 8, 2026. A new ISIN number for Re.1/- paid-up shares will be communicated to the market through a separate notice from BSE.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members of the BSE must:
- Note the record date of January 8, 2026 for the share sub-division
- Cease using the existing ISIN (INE911Z01017) for transactions from January 8, 2026
- Update their systems to reflect the new share structure and await the new ISIN announcement
- Ensure client holdings are adjusted to reflect the 1:10 split ratio post-record date

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: January 8, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 8, 2026
- **ISIN Validity Termination**: January 8, 2026 (existing ISIN INE911Z01017 will not be valid from this date)
- **Notice Date**: December 29, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: All existing shareholders of A-1 Ltd will receive ten shares of Re.1/- face value for every one share of Rs.10/- face value held as of the record date. The proportional ownership and total investment value remain unchanged.

**Market Impact**: The share price is expected to adjust proportionally (approximately 1/10th of the pre-split price) to reflect the increased number of shares. This may improve liquidity and make shares more affordable for retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and depositories must update their systems to accommodate the new ISIN and adjusted share quantities. The change affects demat account holdings, requiring automatic adjustment of share quantities in investor accounts post-record date.

**Trading Impact**: Enhanced liquidity potential due to lower per-share price point and increased number of tradable units in the market.
