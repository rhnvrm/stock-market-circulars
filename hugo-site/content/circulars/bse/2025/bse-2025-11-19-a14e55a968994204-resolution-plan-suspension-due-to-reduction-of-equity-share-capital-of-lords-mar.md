## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - Complete trading suspension affects all existing shareholders and market participants. The stock becomes completely illiquid with no trading permitted.

**Shareholder Impact:** Severe - Existing promoters face complete extinguishment of their shareholding. Public shareholders will experience significant dilution with only 5% public shareholding maintained post-restructuring, implying ~95% of existing public shares may be cancelled.

**Operational Impact:** The resolution plan under NCLT supervision indicates the company has undergone corporate insolvency resolution process. The capital restructuring is part of financial rehabilitation, suggesting previous distress.

**Legal Framework:** Implementation under National Company Law Tribunal authority provides legal sanctity but represents extraordinary corporate action typically associated with insolvency proceedings.

**Investor Considerations:** Shareholders as of record date November 20, 2025 will be affected by capital reduction. Extent of individual shareholder impact depends on specific terms of the resolution plan regarding which shares are cancelled versus retained in the 5% public float.
