title: 'Sub-Division of Equity Shares of Pavna Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 543915)'
---

## Summary

Pavna Industries Ltd has announced a sub-division of its equity shares in the ratio of 1:10, converting each existing equity share of Rs. 10 face value into ten equity shares of Re. 1 face value each. The record date is set for September 1, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Pavna Industries Ltd (BSE Code: 543915)
- Sub-division ratio: 1:10 (1 share of Rs. 10 becomes 10 shares of Re. 1)
- Record date: September 1, 2025
- Effective date: September 1, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE07S101020) for Rs. 10 shares will become invalid from September 1, 2025
- New ISIN for Re. 1 shares to be announced separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE07S101020 with Rs. 10 paid-up value will not be valid for exchange transactions from September 1, 2025 onwards. A new ISIN number for the Re. 1 paid-up shares will be communicated through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date and effective date for the sub-division
- All transactions involving the old ISIN must be completed before September 1, 2025
- Market participants should await the new ISIN announcement for Re. 1 shares

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: September 1, 2025
- **Effective Date**: September 1, 2025
- **ISIN Validity Cutoff**: September 1, 2025 (old ISIN becomes invalid)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action that will increase the number of shares outstanding by 10 times while proportionally reducing the face value. Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held. The action typically makes shares more affordable and may improve liquidity, though the overall market capitalization remains unchanged.
