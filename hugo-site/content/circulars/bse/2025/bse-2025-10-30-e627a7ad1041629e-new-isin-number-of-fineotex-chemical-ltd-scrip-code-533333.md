## Summary

BSE has issued a notice regarding the new ISIN number for Fineotex Chemical Ltd (Scrip Code: 533333) following the sub-division of its equity shares. The company's equity shares are being sub-divided from face value of Rs. 2/- per share to Re. 1/- per share. The new ISIN number INE045J01034 will be effective for all trades executed on and from October 31, 2025 (Ex-Date).

## Key Points

- Company: Fineotex Chemical Ltd (Scrip Code: 533333)
- New ISIN Number: INE045J01034
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Old Face Value: Rs. 2/- per share
- New Face Value: Re. 1/- per share
- Ex-Date: October 31, 2025
- DR Number: 747/2025-2026
- Notice Number: 20251030-3
- This notice is in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251029-5 dated October 29, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action involving stock sub-division where the face value of equity shares is being reduced by 50%, resulting in shareholders receiving twice the number of shares with half the face value.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN number INE045J01034
- All trades executed on or after October 31, 2025 must use the new ISIN number
- Settlement and clearing systems need to be configured for the new equity share denomination of Re. 1/-
- Trading members should ensure proper mapping between old and new ISIN for client holdings

## Important Dates

- **October 29, 2025**: Initial exchange notice (Notice No. 20251029-5) issued
- **October 30, 2025**: Current notice issued with new ISIN details
- **October 31, 2025**: Ex-Date - new ISIN becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The stock sub-division will result in lower price per share, potentially improving liquidity and making the stock more accessible to retail investors. The 1:2 sub-division doubles the number of outstanding shares while halving the face value.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and depositories must update their systems to handle the new ISIN and ensure seamless transition. Shareholders' holdings will be automatically adjusted in demat accounts.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive twice the number of shares at half the face value, with no change in their overall investment value or ownership percentage. The sub-division may improve trading volumes due to lower absolute share price.
