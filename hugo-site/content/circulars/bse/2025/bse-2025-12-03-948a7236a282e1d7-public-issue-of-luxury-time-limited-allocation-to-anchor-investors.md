## Impact Assessment

This anchor allocation represents the pre-IPO stage of Luxury Time Limited's public issue. The participation of three investors in the anchor portion provides some indication of institutional interest in the company. The allocation of approximately 60% to a single investor (LRSD Securities) shows concentrated interest. The absence of mutual fund participation may indicate limited institutional appetite or the nature/size of the offering. The final pricing and overall subscription will determine the success of the public issue.
