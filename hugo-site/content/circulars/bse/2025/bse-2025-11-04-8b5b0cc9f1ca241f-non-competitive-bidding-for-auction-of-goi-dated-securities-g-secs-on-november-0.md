**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to ensure their systems and processes are ready to accept bids through the NCB-GSec module. Contact points have been provided for user ID creation, password reset, bidding queries, and settlement-related matters.

**Investor Impact:** The facility democratizes access to primary G-sec market for investors who may not have expertise in competitive bidding. Maximum limit of Rs. 2 crore per bidder ensures wider participation while preventing concentration.

**Liquidity Impact:** Re-issue of existing 6.48% GS 2035 security will enhance liquidity in this particular security in the secondary market.
