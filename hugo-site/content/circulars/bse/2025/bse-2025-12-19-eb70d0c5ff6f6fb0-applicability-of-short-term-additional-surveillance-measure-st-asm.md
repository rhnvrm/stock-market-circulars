## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies additional surveillance measures to securities experiencing unusual price movements. Securities under this framework may face:
- Enhanced margin requirements
- Reduced price bands
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Increased monitoring by the exchange

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with enhanced surveillance conditions for listed securities
- Investors should be aware of additional margin requirements when trading ST-ASM securities
- Brokers must inform clients about securities under surveillance measures
- All trades in these securities will be subject to enhanced monitoring

## Important Dates

- **December 22, 2025**: Effective date for all changes to ST-ASM framework
- Securities enter and exit the framework from this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The inclusion of 13 securities and removal of 6 securities will affect trading dynamics for these stocks. Investors may face higher margin requirements and lower liquidity.

**Operational Impact:** Trading in the newly included securities will be subject to stricter surveillance, potentially reducing speculative activity and stabilizing prices. Securities exiting ST-ASM but entering other frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM) will continue to face surveillance measures.

**Investor Impact:** Traders and investors holding positions in affected securities should be aware of changed trading conditions, including potential margin calls and reduced liquidity.
