  18, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective December 18, 2025. Two securities have been newly shortlisted for inclusion in the ESM framework: Supertech Ev Ltd (Scrip Code: 544428) and Supra Trends Ltd (Scrip Code: 511539). No securities are being moved to higher or lower ESM stages, and no securities are exiting the ESM framework. The circular also provides a consolidated list of all securities currently under ESM surveillance across different stages.

## Key Points

- 2 new securities added to ESM framework: Supertech Ev Ltd (SME scrip) and Supra Trends Ltd
- No securities moved to higher ESM stages
- No securities moved to lower ESM stages
- No securities removed from ESM framework
- Consolidated list shows 30+ securities under ESM surveillance across Stage I and Stage II
- Changes effective from December 18, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework is designed to alert investors about securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or other concerning trading patterns. Securities under ESM are subject to additional surveillance and may have trading restrictions such as:

- Trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday trading)
- 100% upfront margin requirements
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Price bands and circuit filters

The addition of new securities to ESM indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny due to volatility, price manipulation concerns, or other surveillance triggers.
