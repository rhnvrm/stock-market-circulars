## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 8, 2025
- **Record Date**: October 13, 2025
- **Ex-Rights Date**: October 13, 2025
- **Settlement Number**: DR-734/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders as of the record date will have the opportunity to subscribe to additional shares at Rs.40/- per share (below likely market price given the premium structure). The rights ratio of 21:13 represents approximately 61.5% dilution if fully subscribed.

**Trading Impact**: From October 13, 2025, the stock will trade ex-rights, meaning buyers after this date will not be entitled to participate in the rights issue. This typically results in share price adjustment on the ex-date.

**Capital Raising**: The company is raising capital through this rights issue, with the funds to be utilized as per the offer document. The installment payment structure (Rs.10/- upfront, Rs.30/- on call) reduces immediate capital requirement for subscribing shareholders.

**Market Operations**: Trading members must ensure proper handling of ex-rights transactions in their systems from the specified date to avoid settlement issues.
