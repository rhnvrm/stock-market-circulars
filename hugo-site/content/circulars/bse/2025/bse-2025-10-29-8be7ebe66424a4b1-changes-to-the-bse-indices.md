**Market Impact:** Index fund managers and ETF providers tracking these indices will need to rebalance their portfolios. The amalgamation consolidates Mangalore Chemicals into Paradeep Phosphates, while the demerger of Dalmia Bharat's refractories business (unlisted) reduces the parent company's scope. The GSM listing of Meghna Infracon triggers automatic exclusion from all indices as per BSE surveillance protocols.
