## Impact Assessment

This corporate action has minimal market-wide impact as it affects only holders of specific debentures issued by AKARA CAPITAL ADVISORS PRIVATE LIMITED. The part redemption is a scheduled debt servicing activity. Debenture holders as of the record date will receive partial redemption proceeds and accrued interest. The reduced face value reflects the partial principal repayment, and ongoing trading will be at the new reduced face value.
