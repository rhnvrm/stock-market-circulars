## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt securities listing with minimal market impact. The securities are issued by a private limited company on private placement basis with a relatively small issue size of Rs. 5 crore. The CARE B credit rating indicates higher credit risk, and the 14.25% interest rate reflects this risk premium. The monthly interest payment structure and approximately 21-month tenure make these instruments suitable for investors seeking regular income with higher risk tolerance. No put or call options are available. Impact is limited to debt market participants specifically interested in high-yield, higher-risk debt instruments.
