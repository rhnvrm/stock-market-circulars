---

## Summary

BSE has announced the listing of further securities issued by companies under Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). The circular provides details of 302,000 shares across multiple companies with lock-in periods expiring on August 29-30, 2025.

## Key Points

- Total of 302,000 shares being listed under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Lock-in periods expire on August 29 and August 30, 2025
- Individual share quantities range from 3,800 to 70,000 shares per listing
- Each listing has specific DST (Depository Share Transfer) reference numbers
- 17 separate share listings are covered in this circular

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing announcement for employee stock option securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must ensure proper documentation for ESOP/ESOS share listings
- Depository participants must process transfers using provided DST reference numbers
- Lock-in period compliance must be maintained until expiry dates

## Important Dates

- **August 29, 2025**: Lock-in expiry for 9 share listings
- **August 30, 2025**: Lock-in expiry for 8 share listings
- Shares become freely tradable after respective lock-in expiry dates

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected as this represents routine administrative listing of employee stock option securities. The relatively small quantities and staggered lock-in expiry dates should not create significant trading pressure on the affected securities.
