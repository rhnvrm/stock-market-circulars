Nine securities are being newly shortlisted into the ST-ASM Stage I framework, while two securities are moving out. The changes will be effective from December 16, 2025. The framework is designed to enhance market surveillance and protect investor interests by imposing additional monitoring on securities showing unusual price movements.

## Key Points

- 9 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework at Stage I
- 2 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages
- Framework includes both mainboard and SME scrips
- Consolidated list contains 44 securities under various ASM stages
- Changes effective from December 16, 2025

## Regulatory Framework

The Short Term ASM framework is a surveillance measure implemented to:
- Monitor securities with unusual price movements over 5/15/30 day periods
- Impose additional trading restrictions to curb excessive speculation
- Protect investor interests through enhanced oversight
- Apply progressive stages (I, II, III) with increasing surveillance intensity

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ST-ASM framework requirements for affected securities
- Enhanced margin requirements may apply for securities under ASM
- Position limits and price bands as per ASM stage applicable
- Investors should be aware of additional surveillance measures on these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 16, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 9 securities to ST-ASM Stage I indicates increased regulatory scrutiny on these scrips due to price volatility or unusual trading patterns. Trading in these securities will face enhanced surveillance measures.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and investors dealing in the affected securities must adapt to stricter monitoring and potential trading restrictions. Securities moving out (particularly one moving to ESM framework) face continued or enhanced oversight under different surveillance mechanisms.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding positions in newly added securities should expect increased margin requirements and closer monitoring of trading activity. The measure aims to protect retail investors from excessive speculation and price manipulation.
