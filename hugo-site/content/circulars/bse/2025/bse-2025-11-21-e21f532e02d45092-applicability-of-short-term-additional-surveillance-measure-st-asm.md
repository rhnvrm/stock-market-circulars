The framework operates on 5/15/30 day cycles with multiple stages of surveillance.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 24, 2025
- **Circular Date**: November 21, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This surveillance measure update affects 13 securities with moderate trading restrictions. Securities under ST-ASM framework face additional surveillance including potential trading limitations and increased monitoring. The net change shows 6 additions and 7 removals, indicating routine surveillance adjustments. Investors in affected securities should note the enhanced surveillance status which may impact liquidity and trading patterns. The inclusion of multiple SME scrips reflects BSE's focus on monitoring smaller capitalization securities with higher volatility potential.
