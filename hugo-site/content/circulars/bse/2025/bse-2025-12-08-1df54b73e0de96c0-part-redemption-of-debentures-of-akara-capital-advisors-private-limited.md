## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. This affects only holders of specific debentures (ACAPL-14.50%-29-3-26-PVT). The part redemption reduces the outstanding face value, which impacts the total investment amount but provides liquidity to debenture holders.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the reduced face value from December 12, 2025. The debentures will continue trading but at the new face value of Rs. 25,000.03 per unit.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders on record date will receive part redemption proceeds along with interest payment, providing partial liquidity ahead of the March 2026 maturity date.
