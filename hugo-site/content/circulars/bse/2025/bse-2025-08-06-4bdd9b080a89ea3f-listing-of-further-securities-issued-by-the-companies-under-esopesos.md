## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative action with minimal market impact. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares represents employee stock option exercises and does not indicate new capital raising or significant corporate actions. The relatively small number of shares compared to existing float should have negligible effect on share prices or trading volumes.
