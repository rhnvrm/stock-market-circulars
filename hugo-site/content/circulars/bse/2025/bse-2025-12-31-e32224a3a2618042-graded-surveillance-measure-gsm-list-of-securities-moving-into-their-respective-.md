title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Securities Moving to GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of three securities into various stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective December 31, 2025. Mediaone Global Entertainment and Bcl Enterprises Limited are moving to GSM Stage I, while Lynx Machinery & Commercials Limited is moving to GSM Stage IV, indicating varying levels of surveillance concern.

## Key Points

- Three securities are being placed under enhanced surveillance measures
- Mediaone Global Entertainment (503685, INE828I01019) moved to GSM Stage I
- Bcl Enterprises Limited (539621, INE368E01023) moved to GSM Stage I
- Lynx Machinery & Commercials Limited (505320, INE732D01014) moved to GSM Stage IV
- Securities may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM Framework or IBC Framework

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework imposes progressive trading restrictions based on surveillance stages. Stage I represents the initial level of surveillance, while Stage IV indicates a higher level of concern requiring stricter monitoring. Securities under GSM typically face additional disclosure requirements, reduced price bands, and potentially higher margin requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with GSM-specific margin requirements for these securities
- Enhanced due diligence required for client transactions in GSM securities
- Investors should be made aware of the surveillance status and associated trading restrictions
- Brokers must adhere to applicable position limits and reporting obligations for GSM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 31, 2025
- Implementation of GSM stage-specific restrictions applies from this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The placement of these securities in GSM stages will likely reduce trading volumes and liquidity due to enhanced scrutiny and restrictions. Investors may face difficulty in executing large orders, and bid-ask spreads may widen.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders face potential liquidity constraints and may experience difficulty exiting positions. New investors will face stricter entry barriers including higher margins and reduced price bands.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and trading members must update their systems to reflect GSM-specific parameters, ensure adequate margin collection, and provide appropriate disclosures to clients trading in these securities.
