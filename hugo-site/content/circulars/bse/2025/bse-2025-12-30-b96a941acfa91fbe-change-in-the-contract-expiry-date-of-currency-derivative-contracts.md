## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Trading members dealing in currency derivatives need to adjust their systems and trading strategies to accommodate the revised expiry dates. The changes affect multiple contract types across three months in 2026.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their risk management systems, trading platforms, and settlement processes to reflect the new expiry dates. The one-day shift in expiry dates may affect hedging strategies and position management for market participants with exposure to these contracts.

**Timing**: The advance notice (effective December 31, 2025, for contracts expiring in March-June 2026) provides adequate time for members to make necessary system and operational adjustments.
