## Summary

BSE sought clarifications from JK Lakshmi Cement Limited and Deccan Cements Limited regarding media reports on Moneycontrol.com suggesting JK Lakshmi and Chettinad were in race to acquire Deccan Cements. Both companies responded clarifying their positions on the reported acquisition discussions and confirming compliance with disclosure obligations under SEBI Listing Regulations.

## Key Points

- Deccan Cements confirms no material information or impending announcements that could affect share price/volume
- Both companies reaffirm commitment to timely and accurate disclosure obligations
- Media reports do not have any impact on Deccan Cements' operations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This circular relates to compliance with existing disclosure requirements under Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must promptly clarify media reports that could impact share price movements
- Maintain robust mechanisms for disclosure obligations compliance
- Provide accurate and adequate disclosures in timely manner as required by SEBI Listing Regulations
- Follow company policies on determining materiality of events

## Important Dates

Deccan Cements' denial of involvement in acquisition discussions helps clarify market rumors. Both responses demonstrate regulatory compliance and help stabilize any price volatility caused by media speculation.
