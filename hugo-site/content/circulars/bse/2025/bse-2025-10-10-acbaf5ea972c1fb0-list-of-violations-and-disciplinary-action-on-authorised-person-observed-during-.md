  Inspection

## Summary

BSE has issued Annexure A detailing the comprehensive inspection framework for Authorised Persons (APs). The document outlines 13 specific inspection areas with indicative methodologies and violation categorizations (Internal, A, B, or C). The framework covers critical areas including client registration verification, fund/securities movement monitoring, detection of unauthorized/dabba trading, compliance with advertisement codes, and terminal registration verification.

## Key Points

- All clients must be registered directly with Trading Members only, not through APs
- No fund or securities movement permitted between clients and APs
- APs prohibited from making fixed periodic payments to clients or engaging in cash dealings
- APs cannot be involved in fund-based activities, collecting deposits, or offering assured returns
- Strict prohibition on illegal/dabba/paper trading activities
- APs cannot deal with unregistered intermediaries on behalf of clients
- No incentives to be offered for opening trading accounts
- Written authorization required from clients for trading on their behalf
- All advertisements and business solicitation materials require approval from Exchange and Trading Member
- All AP terminals must be reported to the Exchange
- Mystery shopping, surprise visits, web searches, and client feedback used as inspection tools

## Regulatory Changes

This circular establishes a structured inspection and categorization framework for AP violations:

**Violation Categories:**
