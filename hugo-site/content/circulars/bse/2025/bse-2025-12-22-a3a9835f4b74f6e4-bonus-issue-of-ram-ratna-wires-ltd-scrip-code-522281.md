## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders as of the record date will receive one additional share for every share held, doubling their shareholding without any cash outlay. This dilutes the earnings per share but maintains proportional ownership.

**Market Impact**: The bonus issue will double the total equity share capital from 46,674,536 shares to 93,349,072 shares. Post-bonus, the stock price is expected to adjust proportionately (approximately halve) to reflect the increased share count while maintaining market capitalization.

**Liquidity Impact**: Increased number of shares in circulation may improve trading liquidity and make the stock more accessible to retail investors due to lower per-share price post-adjustment.
