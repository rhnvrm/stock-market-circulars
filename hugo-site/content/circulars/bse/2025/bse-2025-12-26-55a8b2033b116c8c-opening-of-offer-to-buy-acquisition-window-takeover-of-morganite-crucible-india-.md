## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This is a significant corporate action involving a takeover offer for Morganite Crucible (India) Limited. The offer represents the entire public shareholding (25%) as the acquirer and PACs are seeking to acquire all shares held by public shareholders at a fixed price of INR 1557.15 per share.

**Shareholder Impact**: Public shareholders have the opportunity to exit at the specified offer price. The offer is unconditional and not subject to minimum acceptance, providing certainty to participating shareholders.

**Corporate Structure Impact**: Successful completion of this offer will result in Foseco India Limited and its PACs potentially holding up to 100% of Morganite Crucible (India) Limited if all public shareholders tender their shares, leading to potential delisting considerations.

**Regulatory Compliance**: The offer size is 25% (14,00,000 shares) which represents the total public shareholding, though standard SEBI (SAST) Regulations require minimum 26% offer size. This deviation is because public shareholding itself is only 25%.
