title: Further Extension of Timeline for Mandatory Implementation of T+0 Settlement
  Systems by Qualified Stock Brokers
---

## Summary

SEBI has further extended the deadline for Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs) to implement necessary systems and processes for enabling investor participation in the optional T+0 settlement cycle. The November 1, 2025 deadline has been postponed, with further guidance to be provided at a later date. This is the second extension, following an earlier postponement from May 1, 2025. The decision responds to challenges highlighted by QSBs in ensuring timely system readiness.

## Key Points

- **Second Extension Granted**: The mandatory implementation deadline for QSBs has been extended beyond November 1, 2025
- **New Timeline Pending**: Further guidance regarding the revised timeline will be intimated at a later date
- **Scope Unchanged**: The optional T+0 settlement cycle framework established in December 2024 remains in effect
- **QSB Requirements**: QSBs meeting minimum active client parameters as of December 31, 2024 must eventually implement required systems
- **Previous Extensions**: Original May 1, 2025 deadline was previously extended to November 1, 2025 via circular dated April 29, 2025
- **Reason for Extension**: Challenges in ensuring timely readiness of systems and smooth implementation

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes are introduced. This circular solely extends the compliance timeline for existing requirements under SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-3/P/CIR/2024/172 dated December 10, 2024. All other provisions of the December 2024 circular remain unchanged, including:

- The optional nature of T+0 settlement cycle alongside T+1
- Qualification criteria for QSBs
- System and process requirements for seamless investor participation
- Framework for enhanced settlement cycles in equity cash markets

## Compliance Requirements

**For Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs):**
- Must eventually put in place necessary systems and processes for enabling seamless participation of investors in optional T+0 settlement cycle
- QSBs meeting minimum active client parameters as of December 31, 2024 remain subject to these requirements
- Revised implementation timeline to be announced later

**For Market Infrastructure Institutions (Stock Exchanges, Clearing Corporations, Depositories):**
- Take necessary steps and implement systems for the above provisions
- Make necessary amendments to byelaws, rules, and regulations as required
- Bring provisions to the notice of market participants and investors
- Disseminate circular on their websites

## Important Dates

- **December 10, 2024**: Original SEBI circular introducing enhanced T+0 settlement scope
- **December 31, 2024**: Reference date for QSB qualification based on minimum active clients
- **May 1, 2025**: Original implementation deadline (first timeline)
- **April 29, 2025**: First extension circular issued
- **November 1, 2025**: Second implementation deadline (now extended)
- **October 30, 2025**: This circular issued
- **To Be Announced**: New implementation deadline for QSB system readiness

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- **Limited Immediate Disruption**: Since T+0 settlement remains optional and T+1 continues as standard, market operations are not disrupted
- **Delayed Innovation**: Implementation of faster settlement infrastructure postponed, delaying potential benefits of same-day settlement for investors

**Operational Impact:**
- **QSB Relief**: Provides additional time for brokers to develop and test required technological infrastructure
- **Industry Readiness Concerns**: Repeated extensions indicate significant technical and operational challenges across the brokerage industry
- **Implementation Uncertainty**: Lack of new fixed deadline creates planning challenges for QSBs and technology vendors

**Investor Impact:**
- **Neutral Short-term**: Investors continue to operate under existing T+1 settlement framework
- **Delayed Access**: Benefits of optional T+0 settlement (faster fund availability, reduced settlement risk) remain unavailable through QSBs not yet ready

**Regulatory Considerations:**
- Demonstrates SEBI's pragmatic approach to balancing innovation with industry preparedness
- Extension acknowledges complexity of implementing real-time settlement infrastructure
- Maintains long-term policy direction while accommodating implementation realities
