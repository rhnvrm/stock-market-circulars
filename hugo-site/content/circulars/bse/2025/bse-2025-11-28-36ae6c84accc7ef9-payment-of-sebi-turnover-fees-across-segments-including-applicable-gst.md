## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - All trading members across all segments must ensure adequate funds in their accounts to cover SEBI turnover fees plus 18% GST. This is a routine monthly obligation.

**Financial Impact**: Varies by member based on trading turnover volume. The 18% GST increases the total fee liability compared to the base turnover fee.

**Compliance Impact**: Members must monitor their EXTRANET accounts, verify fee calculations, and maintain sufficient account balances to avoid payment defaults. Failure to maintain adequate funds could result in compliance issues and potential penalties.
