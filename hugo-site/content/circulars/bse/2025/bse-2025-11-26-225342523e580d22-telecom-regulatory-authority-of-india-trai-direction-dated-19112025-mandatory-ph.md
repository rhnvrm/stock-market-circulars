title: TRAI Direction on Mandatory Phase-wise Adoption of 1600-Series Numbers by BFSI
  Entities
---

## Summary

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a Direction dated November 19, 2025, mandating phase-wise implementation of 1600-series numbers by entities regulated by RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA. This directive is issued under section 13, read with sub-clauses (i) and (v) of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 11 of the TRAI Act, 1997. The measure aims to curb promotional calls disguised as service and transactional calls, which often result in spam and potential scams, while providing BFSI entities a distinct identity and enabling consumers to make informed decisions about call acceptance.

## Key Points

- TRAI mandates mandatory adoption of 1600-series numbers for service and transactional voice calls by BFSI sector entities
- Directive issued under TRAI Act, 1997 and Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018
- DoT allocated 1600-series exclusively for Government entities and BFSI sector entities on December 23, 2024
- Despite consumer awareness campaigns, adoption of 1600-series by BFSI entities has remained low
- Most entities continue to use ten-digit mobile numbers for service and transactional calls
- Implementation will be phase-wise involving RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA regulated entities
- Sector regulators (RBI, PFRDA, SEBI) were consulted during the development of this directive

## Regulatory Changes

This Direction builds upon existing Regulation 3 of the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018, which requires:

- All commercial communications through Access Provider networks must use registered headers or special series number resources
- Senders not registered with Access Providers are prohibited from making commercial communications
- Violation may result in suspension or disconnection of telecom resources

The new 1600-series requirement extends these provisions specifically to BFSI entities for their service and transactional communications.

## Compliance Requirements

- All RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA regulated entities must adopt 1600-series numbers for service and transactional voice calls
- Entities must register with Access Providers for allocation of 1600-series numbers
- Entities must discontinue use of ten-digit mobile numbers for service and transactional calls
- Access Providers must facilitate allocation of 1600-series numbers to eligible BFSI entities
- Implementation will follow a phase-wise approach (specific phases to be detailed in subsequent communications)

## Important Dates

- **December 23, 2024**: DoT decision to allocate 1600-series for Government and BFSI entities
- **December 31, 2024**: TRAI directed Access Providers to initiate allocation of 1600-series
- **November 19, 2025**: TRAI Direction issued for mandatory phase-wise adoption
- **Phase-wise implementation dates**: To be specified in subsequent communications

## Impact Assessment

**Consumer Protection Impact**: This directive will significantly enhance consumer protection by providing a clear distinction between legitimate service calls from BFSI entities (via 1600-series) and potential spam or scam calls from unregistered numbers.

**Operational Impact**: BFSI entities will need to:
- Update their telecommunication infrastructure
- Register with Access Providers for 1600-series number allocation
- Modify customer communication systems and processes
- Update customer-facing materials to reflect new contact numbers
- Train staff on new calling procedures

**Industry Impact**: The mandatory adoption will create a uniform standard across the BFSI sector, improving overall industry credibility and customer trust in voice communications from financial institutions.

**Spam Reduction**: The measure is expected to significantly reduce promotional calls made in the guise of service and transactional calls, addressing a major consumer grievance in the financial services sector.
