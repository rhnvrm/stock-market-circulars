## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The listing represents routine ESOP/ESOS exercises by employees across six companies. The share volumes are relatively small compared to the typical trading volumes of these companies.

**Shareholder Dilution:** Minor dilution effect varies by company:
- Wipro (largest company) sees addition of 238,522 shares
- ACME Solar sees the highest number at 884,023 shares
- Smaller additions for other companies ranging from 8,500 to 562,000 shares

**Liquidity:** Slight increase in floating stock available for trading. No lock-in restrictions mean shares are immediately tradable, potentially providing additional liquidity.

**Investor Considerations:** This is standard corporate action reflecting employee compensation practices and should not materially affect investment decisions for these companies.
