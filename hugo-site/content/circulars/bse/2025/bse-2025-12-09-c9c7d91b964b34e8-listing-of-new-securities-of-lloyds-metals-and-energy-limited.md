## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. This is a routine listing of preferentially allotted shares representing a relatively small addition to the company's equity base. The lock-in period until June 29, 2026 means these shares cannot be traded freely until that date, limiting any immediate supply-side impact on the stock.
