title: Introduction of IDCW Option under JioBlackRock Liquid Fund on BSE StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

Jio BlackRock Asset Management Private Limited has introduced an Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Option under JioBlackRock Liquid Fund on the BSE StAR MF platform, effective December 29, 2025. The new option offers daily and weekly IDCW frequencies under the Direct Plan, with daily IDCW mandatorily reinvested and weekly IDCW available in both payout and reinvestment modes. This is an addition to the existing Growth Option under the scheme.

## Key Points

- IDCW Option introduced under JioBlackRock Liquid Fund (open-ended liquid scheme with low interest rate and credit risk)
- Available under Direct Plan only with two sub-options: Payout and Reinvestment
- Daily IDCW frequency with mandatory reinvestment
- Weekly IDCW frequency with both payout and reinvestment options (record date: every Monday)
- Minimum investment: Rs. 50,00,000 for both daily and weekly IDCW options
- Minimum additional purchase: Rs. 1,00,000
- Minimum redemption: Any amount or any number of units
- IDCW less than Rs. 100 under weekly payout will be mandatorily reinvested
- Default options: Growth Option, Daily IDCW frequency, Reinvestment mode
- IDCW proceeds to be dispatched within 7 working days of record date

## Regulatory Changes

This introduction is made in accordance with SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations for declaration of IDCW subject to availability of distributable surplus. The AMC has issued Notice cum Addendum No. 06/2025-26 updating the Scheme Information Document (SID), Key Information Memorandum (KIM), and Statement of Additional Information (SAI).

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors must clearly specify their choice of option; absence of instruction defaults to Growth Option with Daily IDCW frequency and Reinvestment mode
- Units will be allotted after deduction of applicable stamp duty and other charges
- Investors should note that IDCW can be distributed from capital (Equalization Reserve) representing realized gains
- Intra-scheme switching facility available

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 29, 2025
- **Weekly IDCW Record Date:** Every Monday (or immediately succeeding business day if Monday is not a business day)
- **IDCW Dispatch Timeline:** Within 7 working days of record date

## Impact Assessment

This introduction provides existing and potential investors in JioBlackRock Liquid Fund with an additional option for income distribution alongside capital appreciation. The impact is limited to investors of this specific mutual fund scheme and does not affect broader market operations. The high minimum investment threshold (Rs. 50 lakhs) indicates this option is targeted at institutional or high net-worth investors seeking regular income from liquid fund investments. The availability on BSE StAR MF platform enhances distribution reach for the fund.
