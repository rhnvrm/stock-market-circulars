## Summary

BSE announces that RNIT AI Solutions Ltd. (scrip code: 517286) has signed agreements with both depositories, enabling compulsory dematerialized settlement of trades. The scrip will trade in Trade to Trade segment with a market lot of 1 equity share, no netting allowed, and shortages will be directly closed out. These parameters will become applicable once the current trading suspension is revoked as per previous exchange notices.

## Key Points

- RNIT AI Solutions Ltd. (scrip code: 517286) has signed agreements with both depositories
- Scrip will trade in Trade to Trade Segment for reasons other than non-signing of depository agreements
- All trades must be settled in compulsory demat form
- Market lot size is 1 equity share
- Netting is not allowed in the scrip
- Shortages will be directly closed out
- Trading currently remains under suspension
- Changed parameters will apply upon revocation of suspension

## Regulatory Changes

The completion of depository agreements enables compulsory dematerialized settlement for RNIT AI Solutions Ltd. The scrip will be subject to Trade to Trade segment rules with specific settlement modalities including no netting and direct close-out of shortages.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must settle all trades in RNIT AI Solutions Ltd. in compulsory demat form
- Trades must be executed in market lot of 1 equity share
- No netting of positions is permitted
- Trading members must be prepared for direct close-out of any shortages
- Trading members should note these parameters will become effective upon revocation of trading suspension

## Important Dates

- Notice Date: October 23, 2025
- Reference to earlier notices: Exchange Notice No. 20251014-24 dated October 14, 2025 and Notice No. 20251015-16 dated October 15, 2025
- Effective Date: Upon revocation of trading suspension (as mentioned in referenced notices)

## Impact Assessment

This notice has medium impact as it establishes the operational framework for trading RNIT AI Solutions Ltd. shares once suspension is lifted. The Trade to Trade classification with no netting and compulsory demat settlement will affect trading strategies and settlement processes. Trading members dealing with this scrip must adjust their systems and processes to comply with these specific requirements. The direct close-out provision for shortages increases settlement risk management requirements.
