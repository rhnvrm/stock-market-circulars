- Trading members must note the listing of new securities effective December 5, 2025
- All allotted shares are subject to mandatory lock-in provisions
- Shares cannot be transferred or traded until lock-in expiry

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: September 18, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: December 5, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: June 8, 2026 (all 18,05,55,555 shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The preferential allotment represents a significant equity dilution for PC Jeweller Limited. The lock-in period until June 8, 2026 ensures these shares remain illiquid for approximately 6 months, preventing immediate selling pressure. The allotment to Non-Promoters at Rs. 18/- per share indicates capital raising activity, which could be used for business expansion, debt reduction, or working capital requirements. Trading members and investors should factor in this increased share count when analyzing the company's valuation metrics and potential future supply once the lock-in expires.
