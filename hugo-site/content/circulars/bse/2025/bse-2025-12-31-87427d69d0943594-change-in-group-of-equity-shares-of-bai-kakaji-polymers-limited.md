## Summary

BSE has announced that the equity shares of BAI-KAKAJI POLYMERS LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544670), currently trading in the Trade for Trade segment under MT Group, will be transferred to the Rolling segment under M Group effective January 14, 2026. This change follows the company's SME IPO listing and represents a standard progression in trading mechanism.

## Key Points

- Company: BAI-KAKAJI POLYMERS LIMITED (SME IPO)
- Scrip Code: 544670
- Current Group: MT Group (Trade for Trade segment)
- New Group: M Group (Rolling segment)
- Effective Date: Wednesday, January 14, 2026
- Notice references continuation from Notice No. 20251230-33 dated December 30, 2025
- Contact: Mr. Anurag Jain, Tel: 022-2272 8822

## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for BAI-KAKAJI POLYMERS LIMITED will change from Trade for Trade settlement (where each trade requires individual settlement) to Rolling settlement (T+1 settlement cycle). This migration from MT Group to M Group is a standard progression for SME IPO companies after their initial listing period.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the group change from MT to M Group
- All trading in the scrip should be conducted under Rolling settlement norms from January 14, 2026
- Trading members requiring clarification should contact Mr. Anurag Jain at the provided contact number

## Important Dates

- **December 30, 2025**: Initial notice (20251230-33) issued
- **December 31, 2025**: Current notice issued
- **January 14, 2026**: Effective date for transfer to M Group (Rolling segment)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The shift from Trade for Trade to Rolling settlement will improve liquidity and reduce settlement burden for traders. Rolling settlement allows for netting of positions and follows standard T+1 settlement cycle.

**Market Impact**: This is a positive development for the scrip as it moves from restrictive Trade for Trade mode to normal Rolling settlement, typically resulting in improved trading volumes and market depth.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members will need to ensure their risk management systems are updated to handle the scrip under Rolling settlement parameters rather than Trade for Trade requirements.
