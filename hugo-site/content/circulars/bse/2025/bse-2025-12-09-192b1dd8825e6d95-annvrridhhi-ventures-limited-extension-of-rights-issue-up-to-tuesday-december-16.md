## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium - The extension provides existing shareholders additional time to participate in the Rights Issue, potentially increasing subscription rates. The 6-day extension may indicate initial subscription levels were lower than anticipated.

**Shareholder Impact:** Positive for eligible shareholders who need more time to arrange funds or make investment decisions. Provides flexibility without materially delaying the capital raising timeline.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal disruption as post-issue activities (allotment, credit, listing) are only delayed by 6 days. The company maintains transparency by promptly disclosing the extension through proper regulatory channels.

**Timeline Impact:** All post-closing activities shifted by 6 days - allotment now expected December 17, 2025 and listing on December 18, 2025, versus original dates of December 11 and 12, 2025 respectively.
