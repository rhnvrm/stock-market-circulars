## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The listing represents routine ESOP/ESOS conversions across multiple companies with relatively small share counts compared to their total outstanding equity.

**Liquidity Impact:** Marginal increase in floating stock for the listed companies. The shares can be traded immediately without restrictions.

**Dilution Impact:** Minor dilution for existing shareholders, with the largest individual listing being 623,293 shares (ICICI Bank) which is minimal relative to their total equity base of over 7.1 billion shares.

**Investor Considerations:** These shares represent employee compensation conversions and may see some selling pressure if employees choose to liquidate their holdings, though impact is expected to be negligible given the small quantities relative to daily trading volumes of these companies.
