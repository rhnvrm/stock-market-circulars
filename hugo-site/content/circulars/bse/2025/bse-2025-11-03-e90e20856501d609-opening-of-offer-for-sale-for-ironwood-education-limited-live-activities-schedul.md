## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The OFS of 2,46,977 shares at floor price of Rs. 39 represents a moderate offering for IRONWOOD EDUCATION LIMITED. The staggered bidding schedule separates institutional and retail participation, potentially reducing volatility.

**Investor Categories Affected:**
- **Retail Investors (RI/RIC):** Can participate on T+1 Day (November 6) with 10% reservation, bidding up to Rs. 2 lakhs for retail benefits
- **Non-Institutional Investors (NII):** Can participate on T Day (November 4) with 100% upfront cash margin
- **Institutional Investors (MF/IC/OTHS):** Can participate on T Day with choice of 0% or 100% margin options

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure systems are configured to handle the two-day bidding window and different investor category requirements. The proportionate allocation methodology will apply if the issue is oversubscribed. Retail investors have flexibility to bid in RI, RIC, or NII categories but must monitor cumulative bid values to maintain retail category eligibility.
