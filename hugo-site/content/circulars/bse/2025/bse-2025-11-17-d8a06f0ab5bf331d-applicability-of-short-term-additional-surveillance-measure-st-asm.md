- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages
- ST-ASM framework includes 5/15/30 days surveillance periods
- Both main board and SME scrips are included in the framework
- Effective date: November 18, 2025

## Regulatory Framework

The ST-ASM framework is part of BSE's enhanced surveillance mechanism to monitor securities exhibiting unusual price movements or volatility. Securities under this framework face:

- Enhanced disclosure requirements
- Additional monitoring by the exchange
- Staged surveillance (5/15/30 days)
- Potential progression to higher surveillance stages or other frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM, GSM, Trade for Trade)

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the updated surveillance status of these securities
- Trading in ST-ASM securities may be subject to additional margins and restrictions
- Investors should exercise caution when trading securities under surveillance
- No securities are moving between stages in this update

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 18, 2025
- **Circular Date**: November 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 5 securities to ST-ASM framework will subject them to enhanced surveillance and potentially higher trading costs due to additional margins. The removal of 5 securities provides relief from surveillance restrictions.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and investors dealing in these securities must adjust their risk management and compliance procedures accordingly. Securities entering ST-ASM may experience reduced liquidity and increased trading costs.

**Notable Aspects**:
- 2 SME scrips are affected (1 entering, 1 exiting)
- Securities can exit ST-ASM by meeting normal trading criteria or by being moved to other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM, GSM, Trade for Trade, or Pledge Framework)
- The consolidated list in Annexure III shows the complete universe of securities under ST-ASM surveillance
