## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Demat auctions indicate delivery failures in the settlement system. While this is a standard market mechanism to resolve delivery shortages, the presence of major blue-chip stocks and one security with exceptionally high quantity (STANDARD CAP - 5.75 million shares) suggests significant settlement issues.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Brokers and clearing members with short positions in these securities will need to participate in the auction, potentially at premium prices, affecting their operational costs.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - End investors holding these securities are generally not directly impacted, though systematic delivery failures could indicate underlying liquidity or operational issues in specific scrips.

- Large-cap stocks: ABB India, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Bharti Airtel, HCL Tech, Tata Consultancy, Tata Steel, Wipro
