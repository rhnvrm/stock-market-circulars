This change is in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251104-65 dated November 04, 2025. The new ISIN will be effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of November 14, 2025.

- New ISIN Number: INE855C01023
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Re.1/- (1:10 split)
- New Face Value: Re.1/- per equity share
- Ex-Date: November 14, 2025

- Previous Notice Reference: Exchange Notice No. 20251104-65 dated November 04, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements a previously announced corporate action involving share sub-division, which requires issuance of a new ISIN to distinguish the new denomination shares from the old ones.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number INE855C01023
- All trades from November 14, 2025 onwards must use the new ISIN for equity shares of Re.1/- face value
- Depositories and clearing systems need to be configured to handle the new ISIN from the ex-date
- Members should ensure proper mapping between old and new ISIN in their internal systems

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 12, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: November 14, 2025 (New ISIN becomes effective for trading)
- **Prior Notice**: November 04, 2025 (Exchange Notice No. 20251104-65)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division increases the number of outstanding shares tenfold while reducing the share price proportionately, potentially improving liquidity and making shares more accessible to retail investors. The ISIN change is a technical requirement that should not impact trading operations if systems are properly updated.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN before the ex-date to avoid trade rejections or settlement issues. Existing shareholders will see their holdings automatically adjusted to reflect the new face value and increased quantity. The change affects all trading, clearing, and settlement systems interfacing with BSE.
