Existing shareholders will be entitled to subscribe to 2 new equity shares of Re.1/- each at par for every 1 equity share held. The shares will trade on ex-rights basis from December 15, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-777/2025-2026).

## Key Points

- Rights ratio: 2:1 (Two new shares for every one existing share)
- Face value: Re.1/- per equity share
- Issue price: Re.1/- per share (at par)
- Payment terms: Full amount payable on application

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must execute all transactions in Tilak Ventures Limited shares on ex-rights basis from December 15, 2025
- Settlement number DR-777/2025-2026 applies for the ex-rights trading
- Members must adjust their systems to reflect the ex-rights status for accurate price discovery and settlement

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: December 15, 2025 - Shareholders registered as of this date will be eligible for the rights issue
- **Ex-Rights Date**: December 15, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-777/2025-2026) - Trading begins on ex-rights basis from this date
- **Notice Date**: December 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The rights issue will result in significant dilution as the company is offering 2 shares for every 1 existing share, potentially tripling the outstanding share capital if fully subscribed. Trading on ex-rights basis from December 15, 2025 will likely result in price adjustment to reflect the value transfer from existing shares to rights entitlement.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders have the opportunity to maintain their proportionate ownership by subscribing to the rights issue at par value (Re.1/-). Non-participation will result in ownership dilution.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems are updated to handle ex-rights trading from the specified date to ensure proper price discovery and settlement processes.
