## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal to low. This is a company-specific delisting event affecting only Chandi Steel Industries Limited shareholders. The company is exclusively listed on the Calcutta Stock Exchange, limiting the investor base and broader market impact.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Standard delisting procedures are being followed using established BSE infrastructure (iBBS, RTRMS platforms). Trading Members and Custodians need to facilitate bidding for eligible investors during the specified window.

**Investor Impact**: Moderate for CSIL shareholders. Investors holding 99.27 lakh shares have a one-week window to participate in the delisting offer at the floor price of Rs. 62.19. Shareholders must decide whether to tender their shares or retain them, noting that post-delisting, trading opportunities will be significantly limited.
