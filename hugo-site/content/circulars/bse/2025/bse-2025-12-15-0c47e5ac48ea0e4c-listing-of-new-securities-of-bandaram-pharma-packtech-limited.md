## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment increases the paid-up capital of BANDARAM PHARMA PACKTECH LIMITED. Lock-in provisions ensure that a significant portion of the newly issued shares (all 59.71 lakh shares) cannot be traded immediately, with different lock-in periods applying to promoter and non-promoter categories. The staggered lock-in expiry dates (2026 and 2027) will gradually increase tradable float over time.
