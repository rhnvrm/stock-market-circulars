## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The number of shares being listed represents a small fraction of the outstanding shares for most companies. For example, Wipro's 567,778 shares is negligible compared to its total market capitalization.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in tradable float for these securities.

**Dilution Impact**: Minor dilution for existing shareholders as ESOP/ESOS issuances are typically small in proportion to total outstanding shares.

**Operational Impact**: Standard listing procedure requiring system updates by market participants to reflect the increased share count for each company.
