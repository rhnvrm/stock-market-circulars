Eligible shareholders will receive 7 new equity shares of Rs.10 face value each for every 3 equity shares held. Trading in the company's shares will be conducted on ex-rights basis from November 7, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-751/2025-2026).

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: November 7, 2025

- **Settlement Number**: DR-751/2025-2026
- **Notice Date**: November 4, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The rights issue will result in dilution of existing shareholding but provides opportunity for existing shareholders to maintain their proportionate ownership by subscribing to the issue. The 7:3 ratio is relatively generous.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders as of the record date will be eligible to participate in the rights issue. The issue price at par with staggered payment (Rs.2.50 on application and Rs.7.50 on calls) makes it accessible for retail participation.

**Trading Impact**: From November 7, 2025, all trades will be ex-rights, meaning buyers will not be entitled to the rights issue entitlement. This typically results in a price adjustment on the ex-rights date.
