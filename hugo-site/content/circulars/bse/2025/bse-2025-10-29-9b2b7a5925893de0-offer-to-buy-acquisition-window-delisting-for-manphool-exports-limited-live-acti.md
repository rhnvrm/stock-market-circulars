## Impact Assessment

This delisting activity has limited market-wide impact as Manphool Exports Limited is only listed on the Calcutta Stock Exchange and not on BSE. The offer size is relatively small at 5.9 lakh shares. The delisting window provides existing shareholders an opportunity to exit at the floor price of Rs. 6.00 per share. Trading members and custodians facilitating bids for their clients need to ensure proper registration and follow the prescribed operational guidelines.
