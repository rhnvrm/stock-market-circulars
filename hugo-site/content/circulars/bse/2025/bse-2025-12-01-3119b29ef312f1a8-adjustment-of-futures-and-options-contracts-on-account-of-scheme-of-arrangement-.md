All existing F&O contracts will be forcibly expired on December 04, 2025, and derivatives trading will resume on December 05, 2025 (ex-date) after special pre-open session pricing is determined.

## Key Points

- All existing Futures and Options contracts on HULL will expire on December 04, 2025
- Record date for scheme: December 05, 2025
- Ex-date for scheme: December 05, 2025
- Entitlement: 1 equity share of Kwality Wall's (India) Limited for every 1 equity share held in Hindustan Unilever Ltd
- Derivatives contracts will be reintroduced from December 05, 2025
- New strikes based on special pre-open call auction pricing (minimum 7 ITM + 1 ATM + 7 OTM)
- Trading in F&O to commence at 10:00 AM on December 05, 2025 after underlying moves to normal market

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must close or roll over all existing HULL F&O positions by December 04, 2025
- Trading members should inform their clients about the forced early expiry
- Members must be prepared for reintroduction of contracts on December 05, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - All traders holding HULL F&O positions must exit or roll positions before December 04, 2025. The early expiry could lead to increased volatility and liquidity concerns in the final trading sessions.

**Operational Impact**: High - Trading members need to communicate urgently with clients, adjust risk management systems, and prepare for contract reintroduction with new strike prices based on post-demerger valuations.

**Price Discovery**: The special pre-open session on December 05, 2025 will determine new F&O strike prices, which may differ significantly from pre-demerger levels due to the separation of Kwality Wall's business.
