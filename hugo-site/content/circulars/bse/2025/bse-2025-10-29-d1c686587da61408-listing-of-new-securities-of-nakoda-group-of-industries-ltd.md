## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a routine listing of a small number of shares (3,752) from conversion of partly paid shares. The volume is insignificant relative to typical market activity and represents an administrative corporate action rather than a material equity issuance.

**Company Impact:** Neutral administrative action completing the conversion process for rights issue shares. The fully paid up status provides clarity to shareholders and improves share fungibility.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders who held partly paid shares now have fully paid up shares with standard trading liquidity. No action required from existing shareholders who did not participate in the rights issue.
