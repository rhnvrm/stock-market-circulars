## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it affects only specific debt instruments (PTCs) of SANSAR TRUST. The partial redemption results in reduced face values, which is a routine corporate action for pass-through certificates. Investors and trading members dealing with these specific securities need to adjust their records and trading systems accordingly. The impact is limited to holders of these three PTCs and does not affect broader market operations or other securities.
