title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Securities Moving to Higher GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of 10 securities into their respective Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages effective from the specified date. The GSM framework is designed to alert investors about securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or other concerns, with progressively stricter surveillance measures across stages I to IV. The affected securities include companies moving to Stage I (3 securities), Stage II (3 securities), Stage III (2 securities), and Stage IV (2 securities).

## Key Points

- 10 securities are being moved to higher GSM stages as part of surveillance framework
- Stage I: Ador Multiproducts Ltd., Shahi Shipping Limited, Polycon International Ltd.
- Stage II: Madhur Industries Ltd., Rap Corp Limited, Adishakti Loha And Ispat Limited
- Stage III: Foundry Fuel Products Ltd., Aayush Wellness Limited
- Stage IV: Popees Cares Limited, Progrex Ventures Limited
- Higher GSM stages impose stricter trading restrictions and surveillance measures
- Securities may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM or IBC frameworks

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements the progressive GSM framework which applies graduated surveillance measures based on security-specific concerns. Each stage imposes increasingly stringent requirements including price bands, additional margins, trade-for-trade settlement, and disclosure obligations. The framework aims to protect investor interests by providing enhanced oversight of securities with abnormal trading patterns or corporate governance issues.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure awareness of GSM stage classifications for affected securities
- Enhanced margin requirements apply based on GSM stage level
- Trade-for-trade settlement mechanism mandatory for higher GSM stages
- Investors must be alerted about the surveillance status before executing trades
- Brokers should implement appropriate risk management measures for clients trading in GSM securities

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: 2025-11-12 (as per circular date)
- The movement to respective GSM stages becomes applicable from the specified date

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Securities moved to higher GSM stages will face reduced liquidity due to stricter trading conditions including narrow price bands, higher margins, and trade-for-trade settlement. This may result in wider bid-ask spreads and reduced trading volumes.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities must exercise heightened caution as GSM classification indicates regulatory concerns. Higher stages (III and IV) carry significant restrictions that may impact position management and exit strategies.

**Market Impact:** The movement of 10 securities across different GSM stages demonstrates active surveillance by BSE to protect market integrity. Companies in higher stages face reputational concerns and pressure to address underlying issues to move back to normal trading.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and trading systems must update security parameters, margin requirements, and alert mechanisms to comply with GSM stage-specific requirements for these 10 securities.
