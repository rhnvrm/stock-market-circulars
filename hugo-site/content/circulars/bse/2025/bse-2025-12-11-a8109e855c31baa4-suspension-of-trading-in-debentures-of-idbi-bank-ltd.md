The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for early redemption of these debentures. Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the specified date.

- Trading members are required to take note of this suspension and inform their clients accordingly

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 11, 2025
- **Record Date**: December 15, 2025
- **Trading Suspension Effective Date**: December 15, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects holders of specific IDBI Bank debentures only. The early redemption will provide liquidity to debenture holders but removes a debt instrument from the market.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems and inform clients holding these debentures about the suspension and upcoming early redemption. Debenture holders on record date will receive early redemption proceeds.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for debenture holders as they will receive their principal back through early redemption, though they will lose future interest income from these 8.62% coupon debentures that were originally scheduled to mature on December 31, 2030.
