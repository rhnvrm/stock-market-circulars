## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This circular affects only existing shareholders of ANNVRRIDHHI VENTURES LIMITED who hold rights entitlements. The company operates in a specific segment with limited market capitalization.

**Operational Impact:** Medium for participating shareholders - Shareholders must take action during the specified window (either trade REs, subscribe to rights issue, or let REs lapse). Trading members need to ensure proper client communication and disclaimer compliance.

**Investor Considerations:** Shareholders should evaluate the rights issue terms and decide whether to subscribe, sell REs in the market during the 4-day trading window, or allow REs to lapse. The short renunciation trading period (4 days) requires prompt decision-making.
