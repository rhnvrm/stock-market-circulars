The shares are ranking pari-passu with existing equity shares.

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following preferential allotment procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

**Lock-in Requirements**:

- **40,00,000 shares** (Distinctive Numbers: 9642001 to 13642000) are locked-in until **June 30, 2027**

- **Lock-in Expiry (Balance)**: June 30, 2027 (for 40 lakh shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of preferential shares following warrant conversion. The addition of 54.5 lakh shares increases the equity base, but with significant lock-in provisions (40 lakh shares locked until 2027 and 14.5 lakh shares until 2026), the immediate free float impact is minimal.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new shares and ensure lock-in restrictions are enforced. The shares will trade under the existing scrip code 522273 with the same ISIN.
