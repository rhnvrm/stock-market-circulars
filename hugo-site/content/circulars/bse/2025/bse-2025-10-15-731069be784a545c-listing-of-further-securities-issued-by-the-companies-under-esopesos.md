## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine corporate action representing employee compensation. The total share count represents negligible dilution for large-cap companies like ICICI Bank and Axis Bank.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in floating stock for affected companies. UNICOMMERCE has the largest percentage increase relative to typical new listings, but the absolute impact remains limited.

**Investor Impact**: No direct impact on existing shareholders. ESOP/ESOS listings are typically anticipated events that are already factored into diluted earnings per share calculations.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the increased share count and new ISIN distribution numbers for the affected securities.
