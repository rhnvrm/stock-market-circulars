- Members and custodians must plan settlement operations around the specified holidays
- Ensure adequate operational planning for extended weekends and holiday clusters

- Update internal systems and calendars with the 2026 holiday schedule

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Market participants must incorporate these holidays into their settlement planning and operational schedules. Several holiday clusters (late March-early April, October-November) require careful planning for liquidity and settlement management.

**Market Impact**: Low - This is routine annual information that enables advance planning. No impact on trading rules or settlement mechanisms, only affects settlement timing on specific dates.

**Planning Considerations**: Members should note the concentration of holidays in March-April (7 holidays) and plan accordingly for extended settlement cycles during these periods.
