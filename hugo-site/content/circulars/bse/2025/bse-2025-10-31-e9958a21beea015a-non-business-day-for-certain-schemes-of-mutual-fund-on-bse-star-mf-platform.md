## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a standard operational notice that aligns Indian mutual fund scheme holidays with underlying international market closures. Investors in these specific international and Fund of Fund schemes should plan their transactions accordingly. The non-business days correspond to public holidays in the respective foreign markets (Japan, US) where the underlying investments are made.
