## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in equity shares of Rolta India Limited (Scrip Code: 500366) effective December 17, 2025, following approval of a resolution plan by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Mumbai Bench under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The approved resolution plan mandates complete cancellation of all existing issued, subscribed, and paid-up share capital, with all shareholder rights extinguished and written-off without any payment to existing shareholders.

## Important Dates

- **December 17, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date
- **Transfer Date**: Date when share cancellation and new equity issuance will occur simultaneously (specific date to be determined as per resolution plan)

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders face total loss of investment as all equity rights are extinguished without payment under the NCLT-approved resolution plan. This represents a complete write-off for current equity holders.

**Market Impact**: Trading suspension prevents any further secondary market transactions, protecting investors from purchasing shares that will be cancelled. The suspension eliminates market complications that could arise from trading securities with no residual value.

**Operational Impact**: Complete restructuring of capital structure under insolvency resolution, with new equity to be issued to resolution applicant(s) as per approved plan. Existing shareholders have no claim on new equity structure.
