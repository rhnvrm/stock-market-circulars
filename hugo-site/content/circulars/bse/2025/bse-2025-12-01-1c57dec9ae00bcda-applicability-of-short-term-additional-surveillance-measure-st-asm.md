- Price bands and position limits

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 02, 2025
- All changes to ST-ASM classifications take effect from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The ST-ASM framework affects liquidity and trading dynamics for the listed securities. Investors holding these stocks should be aware of enhanced surveillance and potential trading restrictions.

**Operational Impact**: Securities entering ST-ASM Stage I will face:
- Additional reporting requirements
- Potential liquidity constraints
- Increased scrutiny from exchange
- Price discovery may be affected

**Investor Impact**: Traders and investors in affected securities should note the enhanced surveillance measures and adjust their trading strategies accordingly. Securities moving out of ST-ASM (especially those moving to ESM) may face different restrictions under new frameworks.
