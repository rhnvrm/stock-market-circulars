title: Cancellation of shifting of scrips to 'Z' group
---

## Summary

BSE has cancelled the shifting of two companies - Brightcom Group Ltd (Scrip Code: 532368) and Naksh Precious Metals Ltd (Scrip Code: 539402) - to the 'Z' group. This cancellation reverses the decision announced in Exchange Notice No. 20251222-31 dated December 22, 2025. The companies will now remain in their current trading group instead of being moved to 'Z' group effective January 02, 2026.

## Key Points

- Two companies exempted from Z group classification: Brightcom Group Ltd and Naksh Precious Metals Ltd
- Cancellation reverses previous notice dated December 22, 2025 (Notice No. 20251222-31)
- Companies will not be shifted to 'Z' group as of January 02, 2026
- All other provisions of the original notice remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

The cancellation modifies the Z group classification schedule, allowing the two specified companies to continue trading under their current classification rather than being relegated to the 'Z' group, which typically indicates companies with compliance issues or concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

Market participants should note the updated status of these two scrips and adjust their trading systems accordingly. No additional compliance actions are required beyond noting the cancellation.

## Important Dates

- **December 22, 2025**: Original notice issued for Z group shifting
- **December 31, 2025**: Cancellation notice issued
- **January 02, 2026**: Date when Z group shifting was originally scheduled (now cancelled for these two companies)

## Impact Assessment

This cancellation is positive for the two affected companies as they avoid the trading restrictions and negative perception associated with Z group classification. Investors and traders in these scrips can continue normal trading without the limitations typically imposed on Z group securities. The move suggests the companies may have addressed concerns or provided satisfactory explanations to the exchange.
