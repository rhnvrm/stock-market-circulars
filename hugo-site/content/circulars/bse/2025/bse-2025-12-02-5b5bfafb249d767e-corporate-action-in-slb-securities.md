## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Hindustan Unilever is a large-cap stock with significant SLB activity. Forced closure of positions may create short-term volatility and liquidity pressure.

**Operational Impact**: SLB participants holding positions in these securities face mandatory position squaring, potentially affecting hedging strategies and creating immediate settlement obligations.

**Investor Impact**: Lenders and borrowers must ensure positions are closed to avoid penalties and to ensure proper entitlement to corporate action benefits (spin-off shares, rights entitlement, dividend payment).
