**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium for trading members. This provides an important opportunity for members to test their trading systems, particularly for the new pre-open session functionality in Equity Derivatives.

The use of a separate test contract master file requires operational attention to ensure proper file management before resuming live trading on Monday.
