- Rajesh Exports Ltd (531500) is a notably large company being affected

**Investor Impact:**
- Investors in these scrips will face restricted trading with mandatory delivery-based settlement
- Higher transaction costs due to Trade for Trade mechanism
- Potential price volatility during transition period
- Reduced liquidity may make position exit difficult

**Compliance Impact:**
- Demonstrates SEBI's strict enforcement of disclosure requirements
- Sets precedent for penal action against non-compliant listed entities
- 35 total companies (8 new + 27 existing) affected shows widespread compliance issues
- Companies must prioritize timely submission of shareholding patterns to avoid penalties

**Operational Impact:**
- Market participants must adjust trading systems for Z group settlement
- Brokers need to inform clients about trading restrictions
- Companies face reputational damage and potential investor exodus
