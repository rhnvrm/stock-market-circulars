This is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251107-64 dated November 07, 2025. The new ISIN becomes effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of November 14, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: SAMPRE NUTRITIONS LTD (Scrip Code: 530617)
- New ISIN Number: INE375C01022
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Rs.5/-
- Ex-Date: November 14, 2025
- Document Reference: DR-756/2025-2026
- Notice continuation of previous circular dated November 07, 2025 (Notice No. 20251107-64)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action implementation where the company has sub-divided its equity shares, reducing the face value from Rs.10 per share to Rs.5 per share. As per standard procedure, a new ISIN is assigned to distinguish the sub-divided shares from the original shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to recognize the new ISIN INE375C01022 for SAMPRE NUTRITIONS LTD
- All trades executed on or after November 14, 2025 must use the new ISIN
- Depository participants and custodians need to ensure proper recording of the sub-divided shares under the new ISIN
- Market participants should ensure seamless transition in their back-office systems

## Important Dates

- **November 07, 2025**: Original notice issued (Notice No. 20251107-64)
- **November 12, 2025**: Current notice date confirming new ISIN details
- **November 14, 2025**: Ex-date - New ISIN becomes effective for trading

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares while proportionally reducing the share price, making shares more affordable for retail investors. No change in market capitalization.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members, clearing corporations, and depository systems must be updated to handle the new ISIN. Existing shareholders will receive double the number of shares at half the face value. Liquidity may improve due to lower price per share post-subdivision.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders' holdings will automatically convert to the new ISIN with proportionate increase in quantity. No action required from investors as the conversion is automatic through depositories.
