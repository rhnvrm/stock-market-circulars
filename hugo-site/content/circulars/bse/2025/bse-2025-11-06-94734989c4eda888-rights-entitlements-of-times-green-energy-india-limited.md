## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform all clients about commencement of REs trading
- Must clearly mention the ISIN of the RE to avoid confusion with ordinary shares
- Must include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for REs purchases stating:
  - Purchase of REs only grants right to participate in ongoing Rights Issue by making application with requisite money OR renounce REs before issue closes

## Important Dates

- **November 06, 2025**: Notice date
- **November 07, 2025**: REs trading for renunciation begins; Rights Issue opens
- **November 07-12, 2025**: Trading period for renunciation of REs
- **November 12, 2025**: Last day for REs trading/renunciation
- **November 17, 2025**: Rights Issue closes
- **After November 17, 2025**: Unsubscribed/unrenounced REs will lapse and be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - This circular enables existing shareholders to trade their rights entitlements during a 6-day window, providing liquidity and flexibility. The short renunciation period requires prompt action from shareholders.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure proper client communication and include mandatory disclaimers in contract notes. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis requires operational readiness.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders have the option to either subscribe to the rights issue, renounce and trade their REs in the market (Nov 7-12), or allow them to lapse. Critical that investors understand REs are distinct from ordinary shares and require action before November 17, 2025 to avoid forfeiture.
