## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date:** April 7, 2025
- **Trading Commencement:** October 31, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry:** June 30, 2027

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine preferential allotment to promoters following warrant conversion. The lock-in period until June 30, 2027 ensures these shares cannot be traded freely until that date. The impact on market liquidity and price is expected to be minimal as this is a promoter transaction with extended lock-in provisions. The shares represent standard equity capital expansion through the preferential route.
