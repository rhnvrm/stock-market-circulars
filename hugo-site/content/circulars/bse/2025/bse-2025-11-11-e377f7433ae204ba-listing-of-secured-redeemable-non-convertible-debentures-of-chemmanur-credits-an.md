**Investor Impact**: The seven series offer varying risk-return profiles with different maturity periods (1-6 years) and interest payment structures. The credit rating of IND BBB-/Stable indicates moderate credit quality with stable outlook. Investors seeking fixed income securities with monthly interest (Series I-IV) or cumulative returns (Series V-VII) now have exchange-traded liquidity.
