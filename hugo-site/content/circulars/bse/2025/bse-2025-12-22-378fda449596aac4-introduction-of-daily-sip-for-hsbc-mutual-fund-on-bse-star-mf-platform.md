title: Introduction of Daily SIP for HSBC Mutual Fund on BSE StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

HSBC Mutual Fund has introduced a "Daily" frequency option under its Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) facility effective from November 28, 2025. This new frequency is available for equity, hybrid, debt, and fund of funds schemes of HSBC Mutual Fund, with a minimum installment amount of Rs. 500 and minimum 6 installments aggregating to Rs. 6,000. The daily SIP will be processed on all business days from Monday to Friday, and is not applicable to HSBC ELSS Tax Saver Fund and HSBC Tax Saver Equity Fund.

## Key Points

- Daily SIP frequency introduced effective November 28, 2025
- Minimum installment amount: Rs. 500 for equity, hybrid, debt and FoF schemes (in multiples of Re. 1)
- Minimum 6 installments required with aggregate amount of Rs. 6,000
- SIP processing on all business days Monday to Friday
- Non-business days falling between Monday-Friday will not be processed on next business day
- Not applicable for HSBC ELSS Tax Saver Fund and HSBC Tax Saver Equity Fund
- SIP Pause, SIP Top Up and Multi Scheme SIP options not available under daily SIP frequency
- HSBC Tax Saver Equity Fund closed for new subscriptions from November 25, 2022 (as per ELSS guidelines allowing only one open-ended ELSS scheme)

## Regulatory Changes

This is an addendum to the Scheme Information Document (SID), Key Information Memorandum (KIM) and Statement of Additional Information (SAI) of HSBC Mutual Fund schemes. The notice-cum-addendum forms an integral part of these documents. No broader regulatory changes are involved; this is a product feature enhancement.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements for investors or market participants. HSBC Mutual Fund has updated its SID, KIM and SAI documents to reflect the new daily SIP frequency option. All other terms and conditions of the schemes remain unchanged.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 28, 2025 - Daily SIP frequency becomes available
- **Notice Date**: November 26, 2025 (Mumbai)
- **Reference Date**: November 25, 2022 - HSBC Tax Saver Equity Fund closed for new subscriptions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a product feature enhancement specific to HSBC Mutual Fund schemes.

**Investor Impact**: Low to moderate for HSBC MF investors. Provides additional flexibility for investors who prefer daily investment discipline instead of weekly, monthly or quarterly SIP options. The daily frequency may appeal to investors seeking rupee cost averaging on a more granular basis.

**Operational Impact**: Limited to HSBC Mutual Fund and BSE StAR MF platform operations. Daily processing requirements may increase operational workload but uses existing SIP infrastructure.

**Limitations**: Daily SIP excludes certain features (SIP Pause, SIP Top Up, Multi Scheme SIP) and is not available for ELSS schemes, which may limit adoption among certain investor segments.
