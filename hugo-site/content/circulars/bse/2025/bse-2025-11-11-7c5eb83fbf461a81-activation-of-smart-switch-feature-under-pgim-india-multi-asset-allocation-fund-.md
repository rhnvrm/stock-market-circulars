## Summary

BSE has activated the SMART Switch feature for PGIM India Multi Asset Allocation Fund - NFO on the BSE StAR MF platform. This feature enables automatic switching between the NFO and various PGIM India schemes including Ultra Short Duration Fund, Money Market Fund, Overnight Fund, and Liquid Fund across both Regular and Direct plans with Growth options.

## Key Points

- Available for both Regular Plan and Direct Plan variants
- All switches are configured with Growth option
- Source schemes: PGIM India Multi Asset Allocation Fund - NFO SMART Switch variants
- Target schemes: PGIM India Ultra Short Duration, Money Market, Overnight, and Liquid Funds

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- AMCs and RTAs will receive transaction reporting for the target schemes (without NFO SMART Switch designation)
- Subscription received schemes include the full SMART Switch nomenclature
- Transaction reporting to AMC/RTA uses simplified scheme names

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: November 11, 2025
- Feature activation effective immediately

## Impact Assessment

This activation has minimal market-wide impact and is primarily operational in nature. It affects:

- **Investors**: Provides automated switching facility for NFO participants into liquid/short duration funds
- **Distributors**: Need to be aware of SMART Switch availability for client advisory
- **AMC/RTA**: Must handle dual scheme naming convention for transaction processing
- **Market Impact**: Limited to PGIM India fund operations on BSE StAR MF platform

The feature enhances liquidity management options for NFO investors by enabling seamless switches to money market instruments.
