## Summary

BSE has announced updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective November 21, 2025. The circular lists securities being newly added to the ST-ASM framework, securities continuing in the framework but moving to higher or lower stages, and securities being removed from the framework. The ST-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance and trading restrictions to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or high volatility over 5/15/30 day periods.

## Key Points

- 8 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework (including Garnet International Ltd, Parmeshwar Metal Ltd, Phaarmasia Ltd, Regal Entertainment & Consultants Ltd, Shanti Educational Initiatives Ltd, Universal Cables Ltd, VL E-Governance & IT Solutions Ltd, VLS Finance Ltd)
- 2 securities continuing in ST-ASM but moving to higher Stage ASM (AVI Polymers Ltd, Solvex Edibles Ltd)
- 6 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework (Danube Industries Ltd moved to ESM, Madhuveer Com 18 Network Ltd, Pace E-Commerce Ventures Ltd, Shiv Texchem Ltd, SK Minerals & Additives Ltd, Supertech Ev Ltd)
- Multiple SME scrips (marked @) included in the changes
- Some securities marked with asterisk (*) indicating NSE alignment
- Consolidated list of all securities currently under ST-ASM provided in Annexure III

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to operate under existing SEBI guidelines for additional surveillance measures. Securities under this framework face enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions including:

- Increased margin requirements
- Price bands
- Periodic call auctions
- Stage-wise progression (Stage I, Stage II, etc.) based on continued unusual price behavior

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with enhanced margin and settlement requirements for securities under ST-ASM
- Investors should be aware of applicable trading restrictions on these securities
- Brokers must inform clients about securities under surveillance measures
- Settlement obligations must be met within prescribed timelines

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 21, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The inclusion of securities in ST-ASM framework typically results in reduced liquidity and increased trading costs due to higher margins. Investors holding these securities may face difficulty in executing trades at desired prices.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect new margin requirements and trading restrictions. Risk management systems must be adjusted to account for securities moving between different ASM stages.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors holding affected securities should note potential liquidity constraints and increased cost of carry due to higher margins. Securities moving out of ST-ASM (particularly those moved to ESM or other frameworks) may continue to face restrictions under different surveillance mechanisms.
