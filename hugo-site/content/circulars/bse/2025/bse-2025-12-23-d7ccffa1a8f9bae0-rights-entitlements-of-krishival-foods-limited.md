- Must clarify that REs shall not be mistaken for ordinary shares

## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium impact on shareholders of Krishival Foods Limited who hold rights entitlements. Shareholders can trade their REs during the 6-day renunciation period (December 26-31, 2025) if they choose not to subscribe to the rights issue. The trade-for-trade settlement and dematerialized form requirement ensures transparent and tracked transactions. Trading members must ensure proper client communication to avoid confusion between REs and ordinary shares, and to prevent unintentional lapse of entitlements due to lack of action before the January 5, 2026 deadline.
