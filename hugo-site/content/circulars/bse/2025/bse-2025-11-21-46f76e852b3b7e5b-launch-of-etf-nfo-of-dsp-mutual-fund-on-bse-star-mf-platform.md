## Impact Assessment

This announcement has minimal market impact as it relates to a routine mutual fund NFO launch. The offering provides investors access to a smallcap equity ETF tracking the NIFTY SMALLCAP 250 index. Members and investors participating in the NFO need to adhere to the specified timelines for fund transfers and payment settlements to ensure successful unit allotment. The extended trading window until midnight on the closing date provides additional flexibility for lumpsum investments.
