  of Stock Exchanges
---

## Summary

BSE has announced a special mock trading session to test the business continuity mechanism for interoperable segments of stock exchanges, as mandated by SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD/P/CIR/2024/167 dated November 28, 2024. During this mock session, BSE will simulate a market outage between 02:15 PM to 02:45 PM, and NSE will be invoked as the alternative trading venue for BSE exclusive securities in the Equity Segment. BSE will resume trading operations between 02:45 PM to 03:15 PM. Members are requested to actively participate in the mock session and provide feedback.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

This mock session implements the mechanism established per SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD/P/CIR/2024/167 dated November 28, 2024, which directed BSE and NSE to establish business continuity for interoperable segments by providing market participants with an alternative trading venue. The mechanism was previously implemented and communicated via BSE circular no 20250328-18 dated March 28, 2025.
