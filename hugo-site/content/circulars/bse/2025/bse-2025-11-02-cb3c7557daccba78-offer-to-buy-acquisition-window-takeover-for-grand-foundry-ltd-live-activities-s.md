## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This takeover offer affects only GRAND FOUNDRY LTD shareholders. The offer price of Rs. 2.00 per share (50% of face value of Rs. 4.00) suggests a distressed asset or small-cap company with limited market capitalization impact.

**Operational Impact**: Medium for participating members - Trading members and custodians need to ensure proper UCC registration, platform access (iBBS, RTRMS, Extranet), and coordinate with clients holding GFSTEELS shares in demat form during the 15-day offer window.

**Investor Impact**: High for GFSTEELS shareholders - This represents a potential exit opportunity for shareholders to tender their shares during the acquisition window at the specified offer price.

**Contact Points**: Multiple contact persons provided for technical support (Trading Operations: 022-22728005, user.trdops@bseindia.com) and specific system support for iBBS, RTRMS, and Extranet access issues.
