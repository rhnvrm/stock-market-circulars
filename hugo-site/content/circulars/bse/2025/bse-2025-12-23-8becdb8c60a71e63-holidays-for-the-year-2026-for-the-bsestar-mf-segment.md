## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Market participants in the mutual fund segment must plan their trading and settlement activities around these 15 non-trading days. This advance notice allows for proper resource planning and client communication.

**Market Impact:** Minimal direct market impact as this is a scheduled calendar announcement. However, mutual fund transactions, SIPs, redemptions, and switches through BSEStAR MF platform will not be processed on these dates.

**Planning Considerations:** The distribution of holidays throughout 2026 includes multiple holiday periods in March-April (4 holidays) and October-November (3 holidays), requiring special attention for quarter-end and year-end mutual fund operations.
