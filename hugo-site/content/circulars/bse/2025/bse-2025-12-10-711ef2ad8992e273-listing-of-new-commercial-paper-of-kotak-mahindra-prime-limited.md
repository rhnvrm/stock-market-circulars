## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine debt market listing notification for institutional investors and debt market participants. The Commercial Paper issuances provide short-term funding options for Kotak Mahindra Prime Limited with tenures ranging from approximately 8 to 12 months. The high credit ratings (A1+ from both CRISIL and ICRA) indicate strong creditworthiness. Trading will be restricted to institutional participants given the high denomination requirement of Rs. 5 lakhs minimum.
