## Impact Assessment

**Dilution Impact**: The preferential issue of 4.63 crore shares represents a material capital raising event. Existing shareholders will experience dilution in their shareholding percentage, though the exact dilution percentage depends on the pre-issue share capital.

**Liquidity**: While shares are listed for trading from December 11, 2025, the entire allotment is under lock-in until June 11, 2026. This means zero immediate tradeable float from this issuance, limiting near-term liquidity impact.

**Capital Raising**: At Rs. 280 per share, Le Travenues Technology raised approximately Rs. 1,295.56 crore through this preferential issue, providing significant capital for business expansion or other corporate purposes.

**Market Perception**: Preferential allotment to non-promoters at a fixed price may be viewed positively if issued to strategic or institutional investors, potentially signaling confidence in the company's growth prospects.
