## Impact Assessment

The anchor investor allocation represents strong institutional interest in Mother Nutri Foods Limited's public issue. The successful placement with three foreign institutional investors (all foreign entities) demonstrates international investor confidence. The absence of domestic mutual fund participation may indicate either lack of interest from domestic institutions or strategic focus on retail and other investor categories. The anchor allocation typically occurs one day before the IPO opens for public subscription.
