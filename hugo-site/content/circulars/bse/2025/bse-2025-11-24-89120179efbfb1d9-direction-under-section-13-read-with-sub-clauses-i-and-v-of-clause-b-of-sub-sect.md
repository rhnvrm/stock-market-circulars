title: 'TRAI Direction: Mandatory Adoption of 1600-Series Numbers by RBI, SEBI and
  PFRDA Regulated Entities'
---

## Summary

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a direction dated November 19, 2025, under section 13 of the TRAI Act, 1997, mandating phase-wise implementation of 1600-series numbers by all entities regulated by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). This directive requires BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) sector entities to exclusively use 1600-series numbers for service and transactional voice calls instead of ten-digit mobile numbers.

## Key Points

- TRAI has mandated mandatory adoption of 1600-series numbering for service and transactional voice calls by RBI, SEBI and PFRDA regulated entities
- The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) allocated the 1600-series exclusively for Government entities and BFSI sector entities on December 23, 2024
- TRAI directed all Access Providers to initiate allocation of 1600-series numbers on December 31, 2024
- Despite consumer awareness campaigns, adoption by BFSI entities has remained low with most continuing to use ten-digit mobile numbers
- The directive applies to all entities under regulation of RBI, SEBI and PFRDA
- Phase-wise implementation approach will be followed

## Regulatory Changes

This direction introduces a mandatory requirement under the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018, specifically:

- Regulation 3 requires commercial communications to use only registered headers or number resources from special series assigned for commercial communication
- BFSI entities must transition from ten-digit mobile numbers to 1600-series numbers for all service and transactional voice calls
- The 1600-series provides a distinct identity separating BFSI entities from other callers
- Non-compliance may result in suspension or disconnection of telecom resources

## Compliance Requirements

**Mandatory Actions:**
- All RBI, SEBI and PFRDA regulated entities must adopt 1600-series numbers for service and transactional voice calls
- Entities must discontinue use of ten-digit mobile numbers for such communications
- Registration with Access Providers required for allocation of 1600-series numbers
- Compliance with phase-wise implementation timelines (specific phases not detailed in the excerpt provided)

**Affected Entities:**
- All banks and financial institutions regulated by RBI
- All securities market intermediaries and entities regulated by SEBI
- All pension funds and entities regulated by PFRDA
- Insurance sector entities

## Important Dates

- **December 23, 2024**: DoT decision to allocate 1600-series numbering
- **December 31, 2024**: TRAI directed Access Providers to initiate allocation
- **November 19, 2025**: Date of this TRAI Direction
- **Phase-wise implementation**: Specific timeline phases to be followed (details not provided in excerpt)

## Impact Assessment

**Consumer Protection Impact:**
- Major tool to curb promotional calls made in guise of service and transactional calls
- Reduces spam and potential scam calls
- Enables consumers to make informed decisions regarding call acceptance through distinct caller identification

**Industry Impact:**
- Affects all BFSI sector entities including banks, NBFCs, insurance companies, securities brokers, asset management companies, and pension funds

- May involve costs for migration to new numbering system
- Enhances brand identity and consumer trust through distinct identification

**Market Impact:**
- Improves market integrity by reducing fraudulent communications impersonating financial institutions
- Strengthens investor and customer protection mechanisms
- Supports broader efforts to combat financial fraud and unauthorized solicitation
