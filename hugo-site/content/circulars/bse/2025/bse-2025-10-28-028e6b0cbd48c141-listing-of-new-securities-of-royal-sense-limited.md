## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing notification for a preferential allotment involving conversion of warrants. The number of shares (3.82 lakh) represents a relatively small addition to the company's equity capital.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new securities and ensure lock-in restrictions are properly implemented.

**Investor Impact**: The lock-in period until April 30, 2026 means these shares cannot be traded by the allottees for approximately 6 months from the trading commencement date, reducing immediate supply in the market.
