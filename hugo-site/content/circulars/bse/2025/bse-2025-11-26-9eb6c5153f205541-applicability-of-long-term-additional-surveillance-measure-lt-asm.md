## Summary

BSE has announced updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective November 27, 2025. Four new securities have been shortlisted into the framework, one security is being moved to a higher ASM stage, and one security is moving out of the framework due to inclusion in ESM Framework. The circular includes a consolidated list of securities currently under various ASM stages.

## Key Points

- 4 new securities shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Comrade Appliances Ltd, Finelistings Technologies Ltd, Olatech Solutions Ltd, and SVP Global Textiles Ltd
- Cybele Industries Ltd moved to Stage III ASM (higher surveillance)
- Khandelwal Extractions Ltd moved out of LT-ASM Framework due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- No securities moving to lower ASM stages
- No securities shortlisted directly to Stage IV
- Consolidated list includes securities across ASM Stages I through IV
- Changes effective from November 27, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework identifies securities based on long-term surveillance criteria and subjects them to enhanced surveillance measures. Securities can be placed in different stages (I through IV) with progressively stricter trading conditions. The framework includes provisions for:

- Direct placement in Stage IV for certain criteria
- Movement between stages based on ongoing surveillance
- Removal from LT-ASM when securities are included in other frameworks (Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, IBC)
- Special treatment for T+0 scrips based on parent company assessment

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised LT-ASM classification of affected securities
- Securities under LT-ASM are subject to additional surveillance measures including potential price bands, trade-for-trade settlement, or other restrictions based on their ASM stage
- Market participants should review the consolidated list in Annexure III for complete status of all securities under LT-ASM
- Special attention required for securities marked with symbols indicating T+0 scrips, NSE alignment, or non-promoter holding criteria

## Important Dates

- **November 27, 2025**: Effective date for all LT-ASM changes announced in this circular

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Securities newly included in LT-ASM or moved to higher stages will face enhanced surveillance measures that may reduce liquidity and increase trading friction. Investors in these securities should expect stricter trading conditions.

**Affected Securities**: 
- **New to LT-ASM**: Comrade Appliances (543921), Finelistings Technologies (544173), Olatech Solutions (543578), SVP Global Textiles (505590)
- **Stage升级**: Cybele Industries (531472) moves to Stage III, indicating heightened surveillance concerns
- **Removed from LT-ASM**: Khandelwal Extractions (519064) now under ESM Framework instead

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their surveillance systems and risk management frameworks to reflect the new classifications. Enhanced due diligence will be required for transactions in these securities.
