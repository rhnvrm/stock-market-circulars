## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The trading suspension affects liquidity in the specific NCD series of UGRO CAPITAL LIMITED. Investors holding these debentures will be unable to trade them from December 19, 2025. This is a routine corporate action with limited broader market impact.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to prevent trading in the affected securities. Debenture holders on the record date (December 21, 2025) will receive their interest payment and redemption proceeds as per the terms of the debentures.

**Investor Impact**: Medium impact for holders of these specific NCDs who may have wanted to exit positions before redemption. However, this is a scheduled redemption event typical for debt securities approaching maturity.
