- **Circular Date:** November 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Trading in the 6 newly added securities will face additional surveillance and potential restrictions under ST-ASM Stage I
- 8 securities gaining relief from ST-ASM restrictions, though some moving to other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM)
- ST-ASM typically results in higher margins, additional disclosures, and trading restrictions (periodic call auctions)

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers and traders must update risk management systems for affected securities
- Increased margin requirements for securities entering ST-ASM
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting obligations for market participants
- Securities exiting to LT-ASM or ESM will face different surveillance parameters

**Investor Considerations:**
- Higher transaction costs and reduced liquidity expected for securities entering ST-ASM
- Improved trading conditions for securities exiting ST-ASM (except those moving to stricter frameworks)
- 3 SME scrips added indicate heightened scrutiny in small-cap segment
- Consolidated list provides transparency on all securities under short-term surveillance
