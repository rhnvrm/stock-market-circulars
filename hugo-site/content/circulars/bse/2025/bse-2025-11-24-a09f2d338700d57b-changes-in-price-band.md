## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

The revision of price bands represents enhanced surveillance measures for these securities. Tighter price bands (2%-5%) will limit intraday price volatility and trading activity in six of the nine affected scrips. This may reduce liquidity and trading volumes. The restrictions suggest these securities may have exhibited unusual price movements or volatility patterns requiring regulatory intervention. Market participants holding positions in these stocks should note the reduced intraday movement limits.
