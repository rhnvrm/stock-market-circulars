title: Surveillance Measure for Securities Under IBC - December 18, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updated surveillance measures for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) framework, effective December 18, 2025. Morarjee Textiles Ltd (Scrip Code: 532621, ISIN: INE161G01027) has been shortlisted in Stage 1 of the Additional Surveillance Measure for Companies relating to the Insolvency Resolution Process. Two companies - Rolta India Ltd and Techindia Nirman Ltd - are being excluded from ASM under IBC.

## Key Points

- Morarjee Textiles Ltd added to Stage 1 IBC surveillance effective December 18, 2025
- No securities moving to Stage 0 (Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure)
- No securities transitioning between Stage I and Stage II
- Rolta India Ltd (Scrip Code: 500366, ISIN: INE293A01013) excluded from IBC ASM
- Techindia Nirman Ltd (Scrip Code: 526576, ISIN: INE778A01021) excluded from IBC ASM
- Consolidated list includes 13+ securities across various IBC stages
- Framework includes T+0 scrips and recommencement scrips with special notations

## Regulatory Changes

The surveillance framework under IBC operates in multiple stages:
- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company
- **Stage 1**: Additional Surveillance Measure for Companies relating to Insolvency Resolution Process
- **Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance for companies in IBC proceedings

Companies can move between stages or be excluded based on their insolvency status and compliance with IBC requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Securities under IBC surveillance are subject to additional trading restrictions and disclosure requirements
- Market participants should note the surveillance stage of each security before trading
- Companies marked with (*) follow NSE classifications
- Securities marked with (~) are T+0 scrips shortlisted in IBC framework as per parent company
- Securities marked with (^) are recommencement scrips

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 18, 2025 - All surveillance measure changes come into effect

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities in IBC surveillance stages face additional trading restrictions which may affect liquidity and price discovery. The addition of Morarjee Textiles to Stage 1 means enhanced monitoring of trading activity.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading in affected securities should be aware of the heightened surveillance and potential risks associated with companies under insolvency proceedings.

**Market Impact**: The exclusion of Rolta India and Techindia Nirman from ASM suggests resolution or closure of their IBC proceedings, potentially normalizing trading conditions for these securities.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new surveillance classifications effective December 18, 2025.
