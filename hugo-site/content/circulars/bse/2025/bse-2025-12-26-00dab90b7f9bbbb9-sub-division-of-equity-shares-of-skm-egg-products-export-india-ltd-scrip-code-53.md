---

## Summary

## Key Points

- Company: SKM Egg Products Export (India) Ltd
- Scrip Code: 532143
- Current Face Value: Rs.10/- per equity share
- New Face Value: Rs.5/- per equity share
- Sub-division Ratio: 1:2 (one share of Rs.10/- into two shares of Rs.5/-)
- Record Date: January 12, 2026
- Effective Date: January 12, 2026
- Current ISIN: INE411D01015 (Rs.10/- paid up)
- Notice Reference: DR-796/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE411D01015 for Rs.10/- paid up shares will become invalid for transactions on the Exchange on or after January 12, 2026. A new ISIN Number for Rs.5/- paid up shares will be communicated to the market through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Transactions using the old ISIN INE411D01015 will not be valid from January 12, 2026 onwards
- Market participants must await separate notice for the new ISIN Number before trading in the sub-divided shares
- All dematerialized securities in rolling settlement segment are affected

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: January 12, 2026
- **Effective Date for Sub-division**: January 12, 2026
- **Old ISIN Validity**: Until January 11, 2026 (last valid trading day)
- **Notice Date**: December 26, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by a factor of two while reducing the face value proportionally. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors due to lower per-share pricing.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and investors must ensure they update their systems with the new ISIN once announced. The sub-division affects all existing shareholders proportionally, maintaining their ownership percentage while doubling their share count.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders will receive two shares of Rs.5/- face value for every one share of Rs.10/- face value held as of the record date. The total investment value remains unchanged, but enhanced liquidity may result from improved affordability and trading volumes.
