## Summary

BSE has published an update to the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework listing 61 securities with their applicable price bands and trading groups. The list includes companies across various surveillance categories (Groups X, M, XT, P, Z, B, MT, T) with price bands ranging from 1% to 20%. This framework is designed to enhance market surveillance and protect investor interests by imposing trading restrictions on securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or other risk factors.

## Key Points

- 61 securities are listed under the GSM framework with updated surveillance parameters
- Price bands range from 1% to 20% depending on the risk profile of the security
- Securities are classified into different groups: X, M, XT, P, Z, B, MT, and T
- Each security has been assigned a specific scrip code and ISIN for identification
- The surveillance measures include various trading restrictions based on group classification
- Group X appears most frequently (26 securities), followed by XT (15 securities)

## Regulatory Changes

This circular updates the existing GSM framework by:

- Revising the list of securities under enhanced surveillance
- Updating applicable price bands for specific securities
- Reassigning securities to appropriate surveillance groups based on their trading characteristics
- Maintaining different levels of surveillance intensity through group classifications

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must adhere to the specified price bands for each listed security
- All trades in these securities must comply with the group-specific restrictions
- Investors trading in GSM securities should be aware of the enhanced surveillance and associated trading limitations
- Brokers must ensure proper risk disclosure to clients trading in GSM securities
- Settlement and margin requirements specific to each group must be followed

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: December 8, 2025
- Effective Date: Not explicitly mentioned in the content provided
