- Securities marked with (^) are recommencement scrips

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 01, 2025 - All changes to surveillance stages become effective

## Impact Assessment

This circular represents a routine surveillance update with mixed implications:

**Positive Developments**:
- Bodhtree Consulting Ltd's exclusion from ASM indicates resolution or improvement in insolvency-related concerns
- No new securities entering Stage 1 or Stage 2 shows no deterioration in existing surveillance universe

**Investor Considerations**:
- The 12 securities moving to Stage 0 remain under surveillance but at the preliminary disclosure stage
- Investors should monitor corporate announcements from these companies for insolvency-related developments
- Trading in these securities may be subject to additional disclosure requirements and surveillance measures
- The consolidated list indicates ongoing monitoring of multiple securities across different IBC stages

**Market Impact**: Limited immediate market impact as this is an administrative surveillance update. However, investors holding positions in the affected securities should remain vigilant about potential insolvency proceedings and associated trading restrictions.
