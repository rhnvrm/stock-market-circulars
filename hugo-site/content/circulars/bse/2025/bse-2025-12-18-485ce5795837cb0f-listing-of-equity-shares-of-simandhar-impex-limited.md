## Impact Assessment

This listing expands the universe of tradable securities on BSE. The promoter holding of 74.64% indicates strong promoter commitment, though the presence of locked-in and pledged shares suggests certain restrictions on immediate tradability. The 25.36% public float meets minimum listing requirements. With 541 public shareholders, the stock has achieved reasonable distribution. The presence of locked-in shares (1.31% overall) and pledged promoter shares may impact short-term liquidity and should be monitored by potential investors.
