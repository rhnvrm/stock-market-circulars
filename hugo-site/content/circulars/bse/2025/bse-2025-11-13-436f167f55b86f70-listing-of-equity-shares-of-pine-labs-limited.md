## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The listing of Pine Labs Limited adds a new investment option in the equity market. The 100% public shareholding structure is unusual for newly listed companies and indicates no traditional promoter holding, which may reflect the company's ownership structure (potentially private equity/venture capital backed).

**Investor Impact**: The availability of outstanding convertible securities (58.86 million shares, representing approximately 5.1% additional dilution) is important for investors to consider when evaluating the company's equity value. The fully dematerialized shareholding ensures smooth trading operations.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Standard listing process with no immediate operational changes required for market participants. The large public shareholder base (216,316 shareholders) indicates significant retail and institutional participation in the listing.
