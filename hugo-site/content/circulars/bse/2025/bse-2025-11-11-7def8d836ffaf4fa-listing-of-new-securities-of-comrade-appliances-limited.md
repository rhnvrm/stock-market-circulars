## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The issuance of 50,000 equity shares represents a small capital raise through preferential allotment to promoters via warrant conversion. The lock-in period of approximately 18 months from the listing date provides stability by restricting immediate sale by promoters. This represents standard promoter funding activity with no significant dilution or market disruption expected.
