- No securities exiting ESM framework in this update

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework is designed to alert investors about securities with abnormal price movements, high-low variations, or other market integrity concerns. Securities under ESM typically face:

- Trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday trading)
- 100% upfront margin requirements
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Staged escalation based on continued concerns

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure 100% upfront margins for ESM securities
- All trades in ESM securities to be settled on a trade-for-trade basis
- Investors should exercise caution when dealing with securities under ESM
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in these securities
- Brokers must inform clients about ESM status of securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 30, 2025
- All changes to ESM classifications and stage movements become applicable from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities entering or escalating within ESM face reduced liquidity due to trade-for-trade settlement and higher margin requirements. This typically results in lower trading volumes and increased price volatility.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors holding these securities will face restrictions on intraday trading and need to arrange full upfront margins for purchases. Exit opportunities may be limited due to reduced liquidity.

**Market Integrity**: The ESM framework serves as an early warning mechanism for market participants about securities requiring additional caution, helping protect investor interests and maintain market integrity.
