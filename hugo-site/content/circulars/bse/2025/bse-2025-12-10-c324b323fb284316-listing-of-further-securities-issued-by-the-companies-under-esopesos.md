## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The additional shares represent a small percentage of each company's existing equity base and are being issued to employees as part of compensation schemes. The absence of lock-in restrictions means shares can be traded immediately, though the relatively small volumes are unlikely to significantly impact market prices.

**Shareholder Dilution:** Minor dilution for existing shareholders across all 7 companies. The largest absolute issuance is Suzlon Energy with 590,000 shares, while ICICI Bank's 503,178 shares represents minimal dilution given its large outstanding share base.

**Liquidity:** Marginal increase in tradable float for each company. This routine ESOP/ESOS listing is a positive indicator of employee retention and compensation programs.
