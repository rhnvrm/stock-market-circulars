title: Changes in Price Band for 16 Securities Effective November 4, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for 16 securities effective November 4, 2025. The price bands range from 2% to 20%, representing adjustments from existing levels. These changes are part of surveillance measures to control volatility in specific scrips. Trading members have been notified to implement these revised price bands from the effective date.

## Key Points

- 16 securities will have revised price bands effective November 4, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive)
- Changes include: 2 securities at 2%, 4 at 5%, 5 at 10%, and 5 at 20%
- Most restrictive band (2%): Tradewell Holdings Ltd
- Multiple securities moved to 20% band: Ghushine Fintrrade Ocean Ltd, Shlokka Dyes Ltd, Sihora Industries Ltd, SK Minerals & Additives Ltd, U H ZAVERI Ltd
- Notice issued by BSE Surveillance department
- Trading members required to implement changes for trading on November 4, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements revised price band restrictions under BSE's surveillance framework. Price bands limit the maximum price movement (up or down) that a security can experience in a single trading day. Tighter bands (lower percentages) indicate increased surveillance and greater trading restrictions, while wider bands (higher percentages) allow more price flexibility.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the revised price bands
- Price bands must be implemented before trading begins on November 4, 2025
- All trades in the affected securities must comply with the new price band limits
- For clarifications, members should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 3, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 4, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revised price bands will affect trading volatility in 16 securities. Securities moved to tighter bands (2%, 5%) will experience more restricted price movements, potentially reducing speculation and volatility. Securities moved to wider bands (20%) may experience greater intraday price fluctuations.

**Trading Impact**: Traders and investors in these securities must account for daily price movement limits. Orders placed beyond the price band limits will be rejected. The 2% band on Tradewell Holdings Ltd is particularly restrictive, indicating high surveillance concern.

**Investor Impact**: Investors may face reduced liquidity and difficulty in entering/exiting positions at desired prices, especially in securities with tighter bands. The changes suggest BSE's concern about unusual price movements or trading patterns in these securities.
