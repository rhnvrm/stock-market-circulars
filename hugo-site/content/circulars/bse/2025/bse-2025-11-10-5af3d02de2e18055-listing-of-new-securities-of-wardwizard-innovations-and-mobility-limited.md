The listing of 40.12 million new shares represents a significant increase in share capital for Wardwizard Innovations and Mobility Limited. This rights issue will dilute existing shareholding proportionately for those who did not participate. The total funds raised amount to approximately Rs. 44.14 crores (4,01,23,546 shares × Rs. 11 per share). The market will absorb this additional supply, which may impact stock liquidity and price discovery in the short term. The pari-passu ranking ensures equal rights for all shareholders.
