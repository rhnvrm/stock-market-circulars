## Summary

Three companies will be added across various indices: Tata Motors Ltd. (Exchange Ticker: 544569), Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd. (Exchange Ticker: 544603), and Lenskart Solutions Limited (Exchange Ticker: 544600). No stocks are being dropped from any index. This reconstitution follows the change in methodology notice 20251029-21.

## Key Points

- Three stocks being added to multiple BSE indices with no deletions
- Tata Motors Ltd. added to BSE Allcap, BSE LargeCap, BSE LargeMidCap, and BSE Industrials
- Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd. added to BSE Allcap, BSE LargeCap, BSE LargeMidCap, and BSE Financial Services

- Changes implemented per methodology notice 20251029-21

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a routine index reconstitution based on previously announced methodology changes from October 29, 2025 (notice 20251029-21).

## Compliance Requirements

- Index fund managers and ETF providers tracking these indices must rebalance portfolios to reflect the new composition
- Passive investment vehicles linked to affected indices need to adjust holdings at the open of January 6, 2026
- Market participants should review their index-linked strategies and ensure alignment with reconstituted indices

## Important Dates

- **December 23, 2025**: Announcement date (Notice No. 20251223-18)
- **January 6, 2026**: Effective date for all index changes (at market open)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The addition of three significant companies to multiple indices, particularly LargeCap and AllCap indices, will trigger rebalancing by passive funds and ETFs tracking these benchmarks. The absence of any deletions suggests net buying pressure for the three added stocks.

**Sectoral Distribution**: The additions span across Industrials (Tata Motors), Financial Services (Billionbrains Garage Ventures), and Consumer Discretionary (Lenskart Solutions), indicating broad-based index representation.

**Fund Flow Implications**: Index funds and ETFs will need to purchase shares of all three companies proportionate to their index weights, potentially creating positive price pressure. The timing at market open on January 6, 2026 provides clear execution parameters for fund managers.

**Investor Considerations**: Investors in index-tracking products should be aware of the composition changes and potential tracking differences during the rebalancing period. The multi-index inclusion of all three stocks indicates their significant market capitalization and liquidity status.
