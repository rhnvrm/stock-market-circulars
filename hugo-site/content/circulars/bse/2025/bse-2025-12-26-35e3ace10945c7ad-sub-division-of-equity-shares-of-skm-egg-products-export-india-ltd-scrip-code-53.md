- Scrip Code: 532143

- Sub-division ratio: 1 share of Rs.10 split into 2 shares of Rs.5
- Record date: January 12, 2026

- Notice Number: DR-796/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action initiated by the company under existing regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that the existing ISIN (INE411D01015) for Rs.10 paid-up shares will not be valid for transactions on or after January 12, 2026
- All market participants must update their systems to reflect the new share structure from the effective date
- Shareholders holding shares in demat form will automatically receive the subdivided shares in their demat accounts
- Market participants must await separate notice for the new ISIN number for Rs.5 paid-up shares

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: January 12, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 12, 2026 (old ISIN becomes invalid for trading from this date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The stock sub-division will increase the number of shares outstanding by 2x while reducing the face value and market price per share proportionally. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Trading and settlement systems must be updated to reflect the new ISIN and share structure. All shareholders will see their holdings doubled in quantity while the total value remains unchanged.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive two shares of Rs.5 face value for every one share of Rs.10 face value held. The total investment value remains the same, but the number of shares doubles. Lower price per share may attract more retail participation.
