## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine commercial paper listing that adds short-term debt instruments to the BSE Debt segment. The listing provides additional investment options for debt market participants seeking highly-rated (CARE A1+) short-term instruments with 3-month maturity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members gain access to two new commercial paper instruments for trading and client investment. The instruments offer competitive yields implied by the discount to face value (approximately 8-9% annualized return based on issue price discount).

**Liquidity Impact**: Limited immediate impact. Commercial papers are typically held to maturity by institutional investors rather than actively traded in secondary markets.
