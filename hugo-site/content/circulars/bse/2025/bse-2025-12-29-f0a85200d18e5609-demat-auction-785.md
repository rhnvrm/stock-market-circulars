## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects 82 scrips across various market capitalizations. While the absolute numbers are relatively small for most securities, the auction mechanism ensures proper settlement and maintains market integrity.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - brokers with delivery failures must participate in the auction, potentially facing higher costs to fulfill obligations. The auction includes high-value stocks like Adani Green, Dr. Reddy's, and Tata Steel, which may see temporary price pressure.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - primarily affects specific brokers who failed to deliver securities; end investors receiving shares through auction will get delivery albeit at potentially different prices than original transaction.
