- **Notice Date**: November 17, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date**: November 18, 2025
- **Lock-in Period**: Not Applicable (NA) for all securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing represents routine employee stock option exercises across multiple companies. The total dilution for each company is relatively small compared to their existing share capital.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible immediate impact as ESOP shares are typically held by employees and not immediately traded in large volumes.

**Company-Specific Impact**: 
- SBFC Finance shows the largest absolute number of shares (2.65 million), which may represent a more significant percentage dilution depending on their total outstanding shares
- Suzlon Energy's 1.92 million shares represent a small fraction given its large existing share base
- Other companies show minimal dilution ranging from 10,960 to 249,969 shares

**Investor Consideration**: No lock-in period means shares are immediately tradeable, though typical employee holding patterns suggest gradual market entry rather than immediate sales.
