## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of 1.29 crore new equity shares represents a significant capital infusion through warrant conversion. This will increase the total outstanding shares and result in dilution for existing shareholders. The staggered allotment across three dates and varying lock-in periods indicate structured fund raising with both promoter and non-promoter participation.

**Liquidity Impact**: Medium - The addition of 1.29 crore shares increases the float, though a substantial portion (29 lakh shares) is locked until April 2027 and 99.68 lakh shares until April 2026.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders face dilution from the preferential allotment. The issue price of Rs. 121/- will serve as a reference point for market valuation. The lock-in periods provide stability assurance as promoters and investors cannot immediately exit.
