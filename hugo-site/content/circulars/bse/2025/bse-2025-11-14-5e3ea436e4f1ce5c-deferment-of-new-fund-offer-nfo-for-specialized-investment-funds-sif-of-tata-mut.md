## Summary

BSE has informed members that TATA Mutual Fund has deferred the New Fund Offer (NFO) of TITANIUM HYBRID LONG-SHORT FUND, which was previously announced as a Specialized Investment Fund (SIF) on the BSE StAR MF Platform. The deferment is effective until further instructions are received from the fund house.

## Key Points

- TATA Mutual Fund's TITANIUM HYBRID LONG-SHORT FUND NFO has been deferred
- This is a Specialized Investment Fund (SIF) that was scheduled to launch on BSE StAR MF Platform
- Deferment is until further instructions from TATA Mutual Fund
- This follows the initial introduction notice dated November 13, 2025 (Notice no. 20251113-64)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational update regarding fund launch timeline.

## Compliance Requirements

Members should:
- Note that the NFO is deferred and not proceed with any subscriptions
- Await further communication from TATA Mutual Fund regarding revised launch timeline
- Update their systems and investor communications accordingly

## Important Dates

- **November 13, 2025**: Initial introduction notice for the fund
- **November 14, 2025**: Deferment notice issued

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to prospective investors interested in this specific Specialized Investment Fund. The deferment does not affect existing TATA Mutual Fund schemes or other NFOs on the BSE StAR MF Platform. This is a routine postponement that may be due to market conditions, regulatory approvals, or internal fund house decisions. No broader market implications are expected.
