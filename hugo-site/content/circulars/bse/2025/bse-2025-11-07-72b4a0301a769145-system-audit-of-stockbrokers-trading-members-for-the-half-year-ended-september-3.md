  30, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE Limited has issued a comprehensive user manual for auditors conducting system audits of stockbrokers and trading members for the half year ended September 30, 2025. The manual outlines the procedure for submitting System Audit Reports (SAR) through the BEFS platform via the Cymmetri portal. A critical requirement mandates that auditors must log in and out of the system during each physical visit to member premises, as per SEBI circular no. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/TPD/CIR/2025/10 dated January 31, 2025.

## Key Points

- Single login provided for each auditor/audit firm to view all appointed members under one dashboard
- Login credentials shared via email to registered email ID post-empanelment with the Exchange
- System requirements: Microsoft Excel version 2007 and above
- Location services must be enabled when logging in through Cymmetri (mandatory step)
- Multi-factor authentication required for portal access
- Auditors must click LOGIN button when arriving at member premises for physical inspection
- Auditors must click LOGOUT button when completing each visit
- LOGIN/LOGOUT tracking is mandatory for each premises visit as per SEBI requirements
- SUBMIT button to be clicked only on the last day of final visit to member premises

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the requirements of SEBI circular no. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/TPD/CIR/2025/10 dated January 31, 2025, which mandates strict tracking of auditor physical visits to member premises through the Cymmetri portal's login/logout functionality. This represents an enhanced compliance and monitoring framework for system audits.
