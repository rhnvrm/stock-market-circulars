## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This affects only holders of specific debentures of a private limited company.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Trading members handling these specific debentures need to update face value in their systems. The partial redemption reduces the outstanding principal amount, which is a standard corporate action for debt securities.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders receive partial redemption proceeds while continuing to hold debentures with reduced face value. Future interest payments and final redemption will be calculated based on the new reduced face value.
