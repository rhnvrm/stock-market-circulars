## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects specific securities and participants with delivery failures

**Operational Impact:** The auction list includes a diverse range of securities across sectors including technology (Infosys, Wipro), telecom (Bharti Airtel), pharmaceuticals (Biocon, Torrent Pharma), automobiles (JBM Auto, Lumax Auto), and others. The presence of high-volume items like STANDARD CAP suggests significant delivery shortfalls in certain securities.

**Participant Impact:** Members who failed to deliver securities must now procure them through auction at potentially higher prices, resulting in mark-to-market losses. This serves as a penalty mechanism to encourage timely delivery and maintain settlement discipline in the market.
