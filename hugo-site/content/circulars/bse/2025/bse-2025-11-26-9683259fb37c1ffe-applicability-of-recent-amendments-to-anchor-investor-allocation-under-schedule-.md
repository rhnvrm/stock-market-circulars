title: Applicability of Recent Amendments to Anchor Investor Allocation under Schedule
  XIII of SEBI ICDR Regulations
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued the third amendment to the ICDR Regulations, 2018, modifying the anchor investor allocation framework under Schedule XIII. The amendments introduce a tiered structure for the number of anchor investors based on allocation size, and mandate a 40% reservation within anchor portion for domestic mutual funds (33.33%) and life insurance companies/pension funds (6.67%). These regulations come into effect from the third day of their publication in the Official Gazette (October 31, 2025).

## Key Points

- For allocations up to ₹250 crores: minimum 2 and maximum 15 anchor investors allowed, with each investor receiving minimum ₹5 crores
- For allocations exceeding ₹250 crores: minimum 5 anchor investors for first ₹250 crores (maximum 15), then additional 15 investors permitted for each subsequent ₹250 crores (or less)
- Each anchor investor must receive minimum allocation of ₹5 crores
- 40% of anchor investor portion reserved: 33.33% for Indian mutual funds and 6.67% for life insurance companies and pension funds
- Undersubscribed portion reserved for life insurance/pension funds can be allocated to Indian mutual funds
- Effective date: Third day from October 31, 2025 (November 3, 2025)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Expands anchor investor base for larger IPOs, potentially improving price discovery
- Provides preferential access to domestic institutional investors (mutual funds, life insurance, pension funds)
- May increase participation from domestic long-term investors in anchor rounds

**Operational Impact:**
- Issuers and BRLMs must redesign anchor allocation methodology
- Systems and processes need updates to handle tiered investor limits and category-wise reservations
- Additional documentation required to verify life insurance company and pension fund eligibility

**Strategic Impact:**
- Strengthens domestic institutional investor participation in IPO price discovery
- Aligns with regulatory objective of increasing domestic investor presence in primary markets
- May reduce concentration risk in anchor book for larger issues by mandating higher minimum investor count

**Compliance Risk:**
- Non-compliance with minimum investor requirements or reservation percentages could invalidate anchor allocation
- Requires careful coordination between issuers, BRLMs, and registrars to ensure accurate categorization and allocation
