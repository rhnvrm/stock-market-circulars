## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt listing with limited market-wide impact. The listing adds 3,500 debentures worth Rs. 35 crores to the BSE Debt segment. The securities are issued on private placement basis and will primarily interest institutional investors and high net-worth individuals given the high face value of Rs. 1 lakh per debenture. The BBB+ rating with negative outlook indicates moderate credit quality with some concerns. The relatively high coupon rate of 13.75% reflects the credit profile of the microfinance NBFC issuer. This listing provides additional investment options in the debt market but is unlikely to have significant broader market implications.
