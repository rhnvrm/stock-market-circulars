## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The ISIN change affects all trading members and shareholders of Rolex Rings Ltd. While this is a routine corporate action, it requires system updates across trading platforms and custodial systems.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems are configured with the new ISIN before the ex-date to avoid trade failures or settlement issues. Shareholders will receive shares with the new face value and ISIN after the sub-division becomes effective.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their shareholding adjusted proportionally (10:1 ratio based on face value change from Rs.10 to Re.1), though the total investment value remains unchanged. The stock will trade under the new ISIN from October 17, 2025.
