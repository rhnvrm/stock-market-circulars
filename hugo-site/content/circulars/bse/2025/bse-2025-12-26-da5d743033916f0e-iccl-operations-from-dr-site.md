title: ICCL Operations From DR Site
---

## Summary

The Indian Clearing Corporation Limited (ICCL) will operate from its Disaster Recovery (DR) site from Friday, December 26, 2025, to Tuesday, December 30, 2025. This applies to all segments including Equity Cash, Equity Derivatives, Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB), Currency Derivatives, Commodity Derivatives, Debt, and Electronic Gold Receipts (EGR). Members and custodians will experience no changes in accessing ICCL applications or URLs during this period.

## Key Points

- ICCL operations shifting to DR site for 5 days (December 26-30, 2025)
- All segments covered: Equity Cash, Equity Derivatives, SLB, Currency Derivatives, Commodity Derivatives, Debt, and EGR
- No changes to member/custodian access to ICCL applications or URLs
- This follows Exchange Circular No. 20251226-1 dated December 26, 2025
- Notice applies to all members and custodians

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a temporary operational shift to the Disaster Recovery site.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements for members and custodians. Access to ICCL systems remains unchanged during the DR site operations period.

## Important Dates

- **December 26, 2025 (Friday)**: DR site operations begin
- **December 30, 2025 (Tuesday)**: DR site operations end
- **Duration**: 5 days of DR site operations

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Minimal to none for market participants. While ICCL is operating from its DR site, members and custodians will not experience any changes in system access or operational procedures.

**Market Impact**: Low. This appears to be a planned DR exercise or maintenance activity. All clearing and settlement operations across equity, derivatives, currency, commodity, debt, and EGR segments will continue normally from the alternate site.

**Business Continuity**: Demonstrates ICCL's business continuity preparedness and ability to seamlessly operate from backup infrastructure without disrupting market operations.
