## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in bonds of REC Limited (Rural Electrification Corporation Limited) effective December 5, 2025. The suspension applies to the company's 5.85% bonds maturing on December 20, 2025 (ISIN: INE020B08DF6, Code: 960160). Trading members are advised not to deal in these bonds from the specified date as the company has fixed the record date for redemption purposes.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies to REC Limited bonds (REC-5.85%-20-12-25-PVT)
- ISIN: INE020B08DF6, BSE Code: 960160
- Record date for redemption: December 5, 2025
- No dealings permitted from December 5, 2025 onwards
- Circular reference: DR-771/2025-2026
- Notice issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action notification for bond redemption pursuant to existing debt market regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all trading activities in the specified REC Limited bonds from December 5, 2025
- Trading members should update their systems to prevent inadvertent transactions in the suspended instrument
- Members must ensure clients are informed about the trading suspension and upcoming redemption

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 25, 2025
- **Record Date**: December 5, 2025
- **Trading Suspension Date**: December 5, 2025
- **Bond Maturity Date**: December 20, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited impact as this affects a single debt instrument nearing maturity. The suspension is procedural and relates to the normal redemption process.

**Investor Impact**: Bondholders as of the record date (December 5, 2025) will receive redemption proceeds. Investors cannot trade these bonds from the suspension date, eliminating liquidity for the remaining 15 days until maturity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure compliance systems are updated to block trades in this specific bond. Given the short timeframe between announcement and suspension (10 days), members should act promptly to implement necessary controls.
