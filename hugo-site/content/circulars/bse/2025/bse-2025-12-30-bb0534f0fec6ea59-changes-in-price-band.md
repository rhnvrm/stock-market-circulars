## Regulatory Changes

Revision of price band percentages from existing levels for the listed securities. Price bands determine the maximum percentage by which a security's price can move up or down during a trading session. These changes are implemented under BSE's surveillance framework to manage volatility and protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised price bands for affected scrips
- All trading systems must be updated to reflect new price band limits before market opening on December 31, 2025
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Orders exceeding revised price band limits will be rejected by the trading system

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 30, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 31, 2025
- Implementation applies from market opening on the effective date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The revised price bands will directly affect intraday trading volatility and price discovery for these 22 securities. Tighter bands (2%-5%) will restrict price movements and may increase circuit filter hits, while wider bands (20%) allow greater price fluctuation.

**Trading Impact**: Traders and investors in these securities need to adjust their strategies based on new price movement limits. Narrower bands may reduce intraday trading opportunities, while wider bands increase risk exposure.

**Specific Stock Categories**:
- **High volatility allowance (20%)**: Infrastructure (NCC), Telecom (HFCL), Engineering (Cyient, Titagarh Rail), Food processing (KRISHIVAL FOODS)
- **Standard allowance (10%)**: Major recent listings (Swiggy, Waaree Energies, Premier Energies), Financial services (Bajaj Holdings)
- **Restricted movement (2%-5%)**: Smaller cap companies with heightened surveillance

The inclusion of prominent recent IPOs like Swiggy and Waaree Energies suggests regulatory focus on managing volatility in newly listed securities during their price discovery phase.
