  Code: 541890)'

## Summary

BSE has announced that Space Incubatrics Technologies Ltd (Scrip Code: 541890) will sub-divide its equity shares in a 1:10 ratio. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs.10/- will be split into ten equity shares with a face value of Re.1/- each. The record date for this sub-division is December 19, 2025, and the new share structure will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Company: Space Incubatrics Technologies Ltd (Scrip Code: 541890)
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Sub-division Ratio: 1 equity share of Rs.10/- split into 10 equity shares of Re.1/- each
- Record Date: December 19, 2025
- Effective Date: December 19, 2025
- Segment: Equity - Dematerialized Securities (Rolling Settlement)
- Current ISIN (INE797Z01010) for Rs.10/- shares will become invalid for exchange transactions from December 19, 2025
- New ISIN for Re.1/- shares will be communicated via separate notice
- Notice Number: DR-781/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE797Z01010 (representing Rs.10/- paid-up value) will not be valid for transactions on the BSE Exchange on or after December 19, 2025. A new ISIN will be assigned for the subdivided shares with Re.1/- paid-up value, which will be communicated to the market through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date of December 19, 2025 for the sub-division
- All transactions involving Space Incubatrics Technologies Ltd shares must use the old ISIN until December 18, 2025
- From December 19, 2025 onwards, only the new ISIN (to be announced) should be used for trading
- Market participants should update their systems to reflect the new share structure and ISIN

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 8, 2025
- **Record Date**: December 19, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 19, 2025 (new subdivided share structure becomes operative)
- **Old ISIN Invalid From**: December 19, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The stock sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares tenfold while reducing the per-share price proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors by lowering the absolute price per share.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. The total value of holdings remains unchanged, but the number of shares increases.

**Trading Impact**: There will be a transition period where the old ISIN becomes invalid and a new ISIN is introduced. Market participants must ensure their systems are updated to handle the new share structure and ISIN to avoid trading disruptions.

**Operational Impact**: Depositories, brokers, and custodians need to update their records to reflect the subdivided shares. The change in ISIN requires system updates across the trading ecosystem.
