## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 17, 2025 - Changes to ST-ASM framework come into effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The inclusion of 26 securities in ST-ASM framework will result in stricter trading conditions for these stocks, potentially affecting liquidity and trading volumes. The removal of 7 securities provides relief to those counters, particularly Amkay Products Ltd which moves to ESM framework.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware that ST-ASM designation typically indicates concerns about price volatility or abnormal trading patterns. This may affect trading strategies and risk assessment.

**Operational Impact**: Market participants need to update their systems and risk management frameworks to account for the new ST-ASM securities and remove the exiting ones from enhanced surveillance monitoring.
