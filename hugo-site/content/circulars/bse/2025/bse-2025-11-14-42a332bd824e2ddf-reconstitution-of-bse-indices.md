## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - This reconstitution will affect index-tracking funds and ETFs that replicate the BSE IPO and BSE SME IPO Indices. Fund managers will need to sell these securities from their portfolios to maintain index alignment.

**Affected Securities**: The 10 securities being dropped may experience temporary selling pressure from passive funds unwinding positions, though the impact is typically limited as these are routine monthly reconstitutions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in index funds tracking these indices should be aware of the portfolio changes, though this is part of normal index maintenance as IPO stocks age out of the IPO-focused indices.
