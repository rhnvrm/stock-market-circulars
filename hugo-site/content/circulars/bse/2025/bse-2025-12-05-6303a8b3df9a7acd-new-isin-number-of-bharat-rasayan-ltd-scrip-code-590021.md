## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must update their systems with the new ISIN number INE838B01021
- The new ISIN must be used for all trades executed on or after December 12, 2025
- Depository participants and custodians need to update their records accordingly

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 05, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: December 12, 2025 - New ISIN becomes effective from this date
- All trades executed from December 12, 2025 onwards must use the new ISIN number

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The stock sub-division (split) makes shares more affordable and could improve liquidity. The face value reduction from Rs.10 to Rs.5 means shareholders will receive two shares for every one share held, though the total investment value remains unchanged.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems, back-office operations, and demat accounts need to be updated with the new ISIN. Market participants must ensure their systems are configured to handle the ISIN change from the ex-date.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their shareholding doubled in quantity while the per-share price will be halved, maintaining the same investment value. This is a positive corporate action that typically enhances marketability of shares.
