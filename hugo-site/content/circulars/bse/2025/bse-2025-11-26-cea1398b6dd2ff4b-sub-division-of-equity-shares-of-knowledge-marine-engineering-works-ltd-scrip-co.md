  (Scrip Code: 543273)'
---

## Summary

Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Ltd (Scrip Code: 543273) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs.10/- will be sub-divided into two equity shares with a face value of Rs.5/- each. The record date for this corporate action is December 22, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Ltd
- Scrip Code: 543273
- Record Date: December 22, 2025
- Sub-division Ratio: 1 share of Rs.10/- into 2 shares of Rs.5/- each
- Current ISIN: INE0CJD01011 (Rs.10/- paid up)
- Old ISIN will become invalid from December 22, 2025
- New ISIN for Rs.5/- paid up will be communicated separately
- Notice Number: DR-782/2025-2026
- Segment: Equity - Dematerialized Securities (Rolling Settlement)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action of stock sub-division permitted under existing regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that the existing ISIN No. INE0CJD01011 (Rs.10/- paid up) will not be valid for transactions on or after December 22, 2025
- Members should await separate notice for the new ISIN number for Rs.5/- paid up shares
- All transactions from December 22, 2025 onwards must use the new ISIN once communicated

## Important Dates

- **November 26, 2025**: Notice date and announcement
- **December 22, 2025**: Record date for sub-division
- **December 22, 2025**: Old ISIN becomes invalid; sub-divided shares effective from this date

## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Shareholders**: Each shareholder will receive two shares of Rs.5/- for every one share of Rs.10/- held. The total investment value remains unchanged, but liquidity may improve due to lower per-share price.

**Trading Impact**: The sub-division becomes effective from December 22, 2025. The old ISIN will no longer be valid for trading from this date. All trading systems and records must be updated to reflect the new face value and ISIN.

**Market Operations**: Trading members need to ensure their systems are updated to handle the new ISIN and face value. The lower face value may attract more retail investors due to increased affordability per share.

**Operational Considerations**: Depository participants and brokers must ensure seamless transition from old to new ISIN. Shareholders holding physical certificates (if any) will need to follow separate procedures for conversion.
