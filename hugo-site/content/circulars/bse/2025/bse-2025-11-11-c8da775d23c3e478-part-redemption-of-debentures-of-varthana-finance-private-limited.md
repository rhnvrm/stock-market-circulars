## Impact Assessment

This part redemption represents a routine debt servicing activity by Varthana Finance Private Limited. The impact is limited to holders of this specific debenture series. The reduced face value of Rs. 41,683 per debenture indicates a partial return of principal to debenture holders. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face value to ensure accurate trading and settlement. As these are private placement debentures, the impact on broader debt markets is minimal.
