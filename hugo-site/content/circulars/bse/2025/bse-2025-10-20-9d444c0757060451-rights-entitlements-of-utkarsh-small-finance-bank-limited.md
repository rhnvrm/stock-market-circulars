- REs renunciation trading period: October 24, 2025 to October 28, 2025
- Scrip Code: 751049, Scrip ID: UTKAR-RE, ISIN: INE735W20017
- Market Lot: 1, Group: R
- Settlement on T+1 rolling settlement basis
- Trade-for-trade settlement applicable
- REs tradable in dematerialized form only
- Un-renounced and unsubscribed REs will lapse after issue closing date

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular follows existing framework for Rights Entitlements trading as outlined in previous notices (20200305-21 dated March 05, 2020 and 20200518-34 dated May 18, 2020).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must inform all clients about commencement of trading in REs with the ISIN number
- Trading Members must clarify that REs should not be mistaken for ordinary shares
- Contract notes/bills for RE purchases must include a prominent disclaimer informing clients that:
  - Purchase of REs only provides right to participate in the ongoing Rights Issue by making application with requisite money, or to renounce the REs before issue closes
  - REs which are neither subscribed nor renounced on or before Issue Closing Date shall lapse and be extinguished
- Trading Members must refer to notice numbers 20200305-21 (March 05, 2020) and 20200518-34 (May 18, 2020) for additional details

## Important Dates

- **October 20, 2025**: Notice date
- **October 24, 2025**: REs trading commences; Rights Issue opens
- **October 24-28, 2025**: Trading period for renunciation of Rights Entitlements
- **November 03, 2025**: Rights Issue closes
- REs not subscribed or renounced will lapse after November 03, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - This affects existing shareholders of Utkarsh Small Finance Bank who hold rights entitlements. The 5-day trading window for renunciation provides liquidity for shareholders who do not wish to subscribe to the rights issue.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure proper client communication and include mandatory disclaimers in contract notes. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade mechanism requires appropriate operational readiness.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders must decide within the specified timeframe whether to subscribe to the rights issue, renounce their rights (sell REs), or allow them to lapse. Un-actioned REs will be extinguished after the issue closing date, resulting in potential dilution for non-participating shareholders.
