## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard operational notice for maturity-related trading suspension.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the three specified T-bills from November 11, 2025 onwards
- Trading members must take note of the suspension and ensure compliance
- No transactions should be executed in these securities after the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 10, 2025
- **Trading Suspension Effective Date**: November 11, 2025
- **Maturity/Redemption Date**: November 13, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Limited impact as this is a routine operational matter affecting only three specific debt instruments approaching maturity. Trading members dealing in T-bills need to ensure these securities are not traded after November 10, 2025. This affects only the debt segment and does not have broader market implications. Investors holding these T-bills will receive redemption proceeds on maturity date.
