## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The preferential allotment of 25.58 crore shares represents a substantial increase in the equity base of Shah Metacorp Limited. This significant dilution may impact existing shareholders' ownership percentages and could affect stock price dynamics upon trading commencement.

**Liquidity Impact**: The extended lock-in periods (until 2026 and 2027) mean that the majority of these newly issued shares will not be available for trading in the near term, limiting immediate supply in the market.

**Investor Consideration**: The preferential allotment to both promoters and non-promoters at Rs. 4.71 per share indicates confidence in the company's prospects. The lock-in commitments suggest long-term strategic investment rather than short-term trading interest.
