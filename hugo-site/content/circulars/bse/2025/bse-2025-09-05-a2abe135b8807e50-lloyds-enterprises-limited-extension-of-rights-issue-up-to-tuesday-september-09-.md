## Summary

Lloyds Enterprises Limited has extended its ongoing Rights Issue closing date from September 08, 2025 to September 09, 2025. The extension was requested by the National Stock Exchange of India Limited and is necessitated by the rescheduling of the Id-E-Milad holiday from September 05, 2025 to September 08, 2025. The rights issue window, which opened on August 25, 2025, will now remain open until September 09, 2025.

## Key Points

- Original rights issue period: August 25, 2025 to September 08, 2025
- Extended closing date: September 09, 2025
- Reason for extension: Id-E-Milad holiday rescheduled from September 05 to September 08, 2025
- Extension requested by NSE via email dated September 04, 2025
- Extension made in the interest of public shareholders
- Company: Lloyds Enterprises Limited (BSE: 512463, NSE: LLOYDSENT)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a procedural adjustment to the rights issue timeline to accommodate a holiday rescheduling.

## Compliance Requirements

- Public shareholders can subscribe to the rights issue until the extended closing date of September 09, 2025
- The exchanges (NSE and BSE) are requested to disseminate this information on their websites for public awareness

## Important Dates

- **Original Rights Issue Opening Date:** August 25, 2025
- **Original Closing Date:** September 08, 2025
- **Id-E-Milad Holiday (Rescheduled):** September 08, 2025 (originally September 05, 2025)
- **Extended Closing Date:** September 09, 2025
- **Circular Date:** September 04, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The one-day extension provides existing shareholders with an additional day to exercise their rights and subscribe to the equity shares. The extension is minimal in scope and is purely administrative, triggered by the holiday rescheduling. This ensures that the rights issue window does not close on a public holiday, maintaining fair access for all shareholders. No changes to the terms, pricing, or other conditions of the rights issue have been made.
