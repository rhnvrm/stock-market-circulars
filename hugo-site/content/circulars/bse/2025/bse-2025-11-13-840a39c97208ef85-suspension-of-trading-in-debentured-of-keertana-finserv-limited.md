---

## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of KEERTANA FINSERV LIMITED effective November 18, 2025. The suspension is due to the company setting a record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the no-dealings date.

## Key Points

- Company: KEERTANA FINSERV LIMITED
- Debenture Series: KFSL-11.60%-28-11-25-PVT
- ISIN: INE0NES07071
- BSE Code: 975222
- Record Date: November 18, 2025
- No Dealings From: November 18, 2025
- Purpose: Redemption of Debentures and Payment of Interest
- Notice Number: DR-758/2025-2026
- Segment: Debt

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard trading suspension notice pursuant to corporate action procedures for debt securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all trading activities in the specified debentures from November 18, 2025
- No buy or sell orders should be accepted for ISIN INE0NES07071 from the suspension date
- Trading members must inform their clients holding or interested in these debentures about the suspension
- Ensure settlement of any pending trades executed before the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **November 13, 2025**: Circular announcement date
- **November 18, 2025**: Record date for interest payment and redemption
- **November 18, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date (no dealings from this date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders and traders of this specific NCD series. Investors holding these debentures will receive interest payment and redemption proceeds based on the record date.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trading in this specific ISIN. Investors cannot exit their positions through secondary market trading from November 18, 2025 onwards.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders as of the record date will be eligible for the final interest payment and redemption. The 11.60% coupon rate suggests this is the maturity redemption (note the "28-11-25" in the series name indicating November 28, 2025 maturity). Secondary market liquidity is eliminated from the suspension date, but holders will receive redemption proceeds at maturity.
