This follows the company's SME IPO listing and marks the transition to regular trading operations.

## Key Points

- HRS ALUGLAZE LIMITED scrip code: 544656
- Current classification: MT Group (Trade for Trade segment)
- New classification: M Group (Rolling segment)
- Segment: SME

## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for HRS ALUGLAZE LIMITED shares will change from Trade for Trade settlement to Rolling settlement. This is a standard progression for SME IPO stocks after the initial listing period, allowing for more liquid trading conditions compared to the compulsory delivery-based Trade for Trade segment.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members should:
- Note the group change from MT to M Group
- Update their systems and records accordingly
- Contact Mr. Anurag Jain for further details or clarifications
- Ensure trading operations are adjusted for the new segment classification

## Important Dates

- **December 18, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **January 02, 2025**: Effective date for transfer to Rolling segment (M Group)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The shift from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment will enhance liquidity and trading flexibility for HRS ALUGLAZE LIMITED shares. Trade for Trade requires compulsory delivery and has T+1 settlement, while Rolling segment allows for normal intraday trading and T+2 settlement.

**Market Participants**: Trading members and investors will benefit from improved trading conditions, including the ability to conduct intraday trades and access to margin facilities that are not available in the Trade for Trade segment.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members need to update their systems and ensure compliance with the new trading segment requirements before the effective date.
