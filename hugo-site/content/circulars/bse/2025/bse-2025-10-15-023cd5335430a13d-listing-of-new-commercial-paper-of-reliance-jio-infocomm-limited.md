## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt market listing with minimal market impact. The Commercial Papers are short-term debt instruments (55-62 days tenure) issued on private placement basis. Given the high credit ratings (A1+ from both CARE and CRISIL), these instruments provide institutional investors with short-term investment options. The listing expands the debt market's product offerings but does not affect equity markets or broader trading operations. The issuances reflect Reliance Jio's continued access to the debt capital markets for short-term funding requirements.
