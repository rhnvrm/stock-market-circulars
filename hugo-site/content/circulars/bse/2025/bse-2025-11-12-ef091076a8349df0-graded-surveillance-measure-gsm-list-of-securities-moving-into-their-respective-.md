title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Securities Moving to Different GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of 10 securities into various stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. The securities are being moved to GSM Stages I through IV, which entails enhanced surveillance and trading restrictions based on predefined criteria such as price volatility, corporate governance issues, or compliance concerns.

## Key Points

- 3 securities moving to GSM Stage I: Ador Multiproducts Ltd., Shahi Shipping Limited, Polycon International Ltd.
- 3 securities moving to GSM Stage II: Madhur Industries Ltd., Rap Corp Limited, Adishakti Loha And Ispat Limited
- 2 securities moving to GSM Stage III: Foundry Fuel Products Ltd., Aayush Wellness Limited
- 2 securities moving to GSM Stage IV: Popees Cares Limited, Progrex Ventures Limited
- Securities may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure) or IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) frameworks
- Classification is aligned with NSE standards

## Regulatory Changes

The Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) is a progressive surveillance framework where securities are placed in different stages based on specific criteria. Higher GSM stages typically involve:
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Trading restrictions (price bands, periodic call auctions)
- Increased margin requirements
- Enhanced monitoring by the exchange

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors trading in these securities must be aware of applicable trading restrictions for each GSM stage
-Brokers must ensure clients are informed about the GSM status of these securities
- Listed companies should maintain compliance with disclosure norms to avoid further escalation in GSM stages
- Market participants must adhere to any additional margin requirements imposed on these securities

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: November 12, 2025
- Effective Date: To be implemented as per exchange directives (typically with immediate effect or T+1)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The movement of these securities into GSM stages signals regulatory concerns about their trading patterns or corporate governance. This typically results in reduced liquidity, wider bid-ask spreads, and potential price discovery challenges.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities will face:
- Restricted trading conditions
- Higher transaction costs due to increased margins
- Potential difficulty in entering or exiting positions
- Need for enhanced due diligence

**Operational Impact:** The GSM framework serves as an early warning system for market participants and helps maintain market integrity by identifying securities with abnormal characteristics requiring closer monitoring.
