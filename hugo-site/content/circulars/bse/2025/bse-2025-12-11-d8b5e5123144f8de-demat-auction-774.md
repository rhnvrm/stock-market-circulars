## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction involves 89 scrips, indicating widespread delivery failures across multiple stocks. This could lead to price volatility in affected securities during and after the auction.

**Liquidity Impact:** Demat auctions typically result in elevated prices as defaulting members must procure shares from the open market, potentially creating temporary demand-supply imbalances.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders of the listed securities may experience short-term price movements. The presence of large quantities like 432,980 shares of Magellanic Cloud, 300,002 shares of Spright Agro, and 150,000 shares of Captain Pipe suggests significant settlement issues that could affect these stocks more prominently.

**Trading Member Impact:** Members who failed to deliver face financial penalties through higher auction prices and potential regulatory scrutiny for repeated failures.

**Systemic Indicator:** The range and number of scrips in this auction may indicate broader settlement efficiency issues in the market or concentrated problems with specific trading members.
