---

## Summary

SEBI has comprehensively revised the Block Deal Framework through Circular SEBI/HO/MRD/POD-III/CIR/P/2025/134 dated October 08, 2025. The circular modifies existing provisions to establish two distinct trading windows with specific reference prices, introduces a uniform minimum order size of INR 25 Crores, and mandates a ±3% price range from reference prices. These changes apply to both T+1 and T+0 settlement cycles and will be effective 60 days from the circular date.

## Key Points

- Two block deal windows established: Morning Window (08:45 AM - 09:00 AM) and Afternoon Window (02:05 PM - 02:20 PM)
- Morning Window uses previous day closing price as reference; Afternoon Window uses VWAP from 01:45 PM to 02:00 PM
- Minimum order size increased to INR 25 Crores for all block deal executions
- Price range restricted to ±3% of applicable reference price in respective windows
- Stock exchanges can set trading hours between 08:45 AM to 05:00 PM
- VWAP calculation and dissemination period: 02:00 PM to 02:05 PM
- All block deals must result in delivery and cannot be squared off or reversed
- Same-day public disclosure required after market hours including scrip name, client name, quantity, and traded price
- Provisions applicable to both T+1 and optional T+0 settlement cycles
- All surveillance, risk containment, and trading practices of normal segment apply to block deal windows

## Regulatory Changes

**Modified Framework Elements:**

1. **Trading Windows**: Replaced previous framework with two specific windows:
   - Morning Block Deal Window: 08:45 AM - 09:00 AM (reference: previous day closing price)
   - Afternoon Block Deal Window: 02:05 PM - 02:20 PM (reference: VWAP from 01:45 PM - 02:00 PM)

2. **Reference Price Methodology**: 
   - Morning window: Static reference (previous close)
   - Afternoon window: Dynamic reference based on intraday VWAP calculation
   - Preparation period (02:00 PM - 02:05 PM) for VWAP calculation and dissemination

3. **Order Parameters**:
   - Minimum order size: INR 25 Crores (uniform threshold)
   - Price band: ±3% from applicable reference price
   - Subject to surveillance measures and applicable price bands

4. **Settlement Requirements**:
   - Mandatory delivery-based settlement
   - No square-off or reversal permitted
   - Framework extends to optional T+0 settlement cycle

5. **Disclosure Norms**:
   - Enhanced transparency with same-day disclosure after market hours
   - Information to include: scrip name, client name, quantity, traded price

## Compliance Requirements

**For Stock Exchanges:**
- Implement separate trading window(s) for block deals within 08:45 AM - 05:00 PM trading hours
- Calculate and disseminate VWAP between 02:00 PM to 02:05 PM for afternoon window reference
- Ensure same-day public dissemination of block deal information after market hours
- Apply all surveillance and risk containment measures applicable to normal trading segment
- Make necessary amendments to byelaws, rules, and regulations
- Notify market participants and investors of the changes

**For Clearing Corporations:**
- Implement appropriate settlement practices for block deal windows
- Ensure delivery-based settlement without square-off provisions
- Apply risk containment measures equivalent to normal segment

**For Depositories:**
- Ensure settlement infrastructure supports delivery-based block deal settlements
- Implement necessary systems for T+0 and T+1 settlement cycles

**For Market Participants:**
- Adhere to minimum order size of INR 25 Crores
- Execute orders within ±3% price range of reference price
- Ensure delivery-based settlement (no intraday square-off)

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: 60th day from circular issuance (approximately December 7, 2025)
- **Daily Operational Timings**:
  - Morning Block Deal Window: 08:45 AM - 09:00 AM
  - VWAP Calculation Period: 01:45 PM - 02:00 PM
  - VWAP Dissemination Period: 02:00 PM - 02:05 PM
  - Afternoon Block Deal Window: 02:05 PM - 02:20 PM

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**

1. **Institutional Trading**: The INR 25 Crores minimum significantly increases the threshold, limiting block deal facility to larger institutional transactions and reducing its accessibility for mid-sized institutional trades.

2. **Price Discovery**: Two-window structure with different reference prices creates distinct pricing mechanisms - morning window offers certainty based on previous close, while afternoon window reflects intraday price movements through VWAP.

3. **Market Liquidity**: Afternoon window's VWAP-based pricing may reduce information asymmetry and improve price efficiency for large trades, potentially encouraging more institutional participation.

4. **Trading Strategy**: The ±3% price band provides negotiation flexibility while containing price volatility, balancing execution certainty with market impact mitigation.

**Operational Impact:**

1. **Infrastructure Requirements**: Stock exchanges, clearing corporations, and depositories must upgrade systems to support dual windows with different reference price calculations and real-time VWAP computation.

2. **Surveillance Enhancement**: Extended trading hours (08:45 AM start) and multiple windows require enhanced surveillance infrastructure and real-time monitoring capabilities.

3. **Disclosure Compliance**: Same-day disclosure requirements necessitate automated reporting systems for transparency obligations.

**Regulatory Impact:**

1. **T+0 Alignment**: Framework's applicability to optional T+0 settlement cycle demonstrates SEBI's commitment to faster settlement cycles while maintaining market integrity for large trades.

2. **Delivery Mandate**: Prohibition on square-off ensures genuine investment intent and reduces speculative use of block deal mechanism.

3. **Transparency**: Enhanced disclosure requirements (including client names) increase market transparency and regulatory oversight of large trades.
