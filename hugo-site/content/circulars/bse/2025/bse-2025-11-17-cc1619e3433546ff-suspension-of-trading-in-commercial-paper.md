## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects liquidity in 24 commercial paper instruments in the debt market segment. However, this is a scheduled redemption event and market participants would have planned accordingly.

**Operational Impact**: Low - routine corporate action that requires trading system updates but does not affect broader market operations.

**Investor Impact**: Low to Medium - investors holding these instruments will receive redemption proceeds as scheduled. No trading possible from suspension dates, but this is expected for maturing securities.

**Sector Coverage**: Diverse - includes financial services (NBFC, wealth management), retail, infrastructure, cement, and power sectors, indicating broad-based commercial paper redemption activity.
