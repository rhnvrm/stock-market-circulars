All stock exchanges, clearing corporations, depositories, registered intermediaries, and other SEBI regulated entities must implement accessibility provisions on their digital platforms with specific timelines and reporting requirements.

## Key Points

- Phased implementation with specific milestones over 6 months
- Annual compliance reporting required within 30 days of financial year end
- IAAP certified accessibility professionals must be appointed as auditors
- Accessibility audits mandatory for all digital platforms

## Regulatory Changes

New mandatory compliance framework established requiring all SEBI regulated entities to ensure digital accessibility for persons with disabilities. This includes specific provisions for accessibility (Section 40), access to information and communication technology (Section 42), time limits for accessibility by service providers (Section 46), and accessibility rules compliance.

## Compliance Requirements

- Submit list of digital platforms within 1 month
- Submit compliance/action taken report within 1 month

Entities must invest in accessibility infrastructure, professional auditing services, and ongoing compliance monitoring. The phased approach provides structured implementation but requires immediate action planning and resource allocation across the entire securities market ecosystem.
