The shares were allotted in six tranches across two dates (August 7, 2025 and August 25, 2025) with distinctive numbers ranging from 4,04,93,155 to 5,44,43,154. The newly listed securities are subject to lock-in periods expiring on either April 15, 2026 or April 15, 2027 depending on the tranche.

## Key Points

- Total of 13,950,000 equity shares listed
- Allotment completed in two phases: August 7, 2025 (8,805,000 shares) and August 25, 2025 (5,145,000 shares)
- Six distinct tranches with varying lock-in periods
- Lock-in expiry dates: April 15, 2026 (3 tranches) and April 15, 2027 (3 tranches)
- Distinctive numbers assigned from 4,04,93,155 to 5,44,43,154

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard listing notification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Shareholders must comply with lock-in requirements until specified expiry dates
- Shares cannot be traded or transferred before lock-in expiry
- Company must maintain records of distinctive numbers and lock-in schedules

## Important Dates

- **August 7, 2025**: First allotment date (8,805,000 shares)
- **August 25, 2025**: Second allotment date (5,145,000 shares)
- **April 15, 2026**: Lock-in expiry for 8,950,000 shares (tranches 2, 3, and 6)
- **April 15, 2027**: Lock-in expiry for 5,000,000 shares (tranches 1, 4, and 5)

## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market impact as it represents routine corporate action for capital expansion or employee stock options. The lock-in periods indicate these are likely preferential allotments or promoter holdings. The staggered lock-in expiry dates (2026 and 2027) will prevent sudden supply pressure on the stock. Investors should note the potential dilution effect of 13.95 million additional shares entering the market, though the actual trading impact will be phased based on lock-in expiry dates.
