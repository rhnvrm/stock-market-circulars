## Summary

BSE has announced trading suspension in ALPS INDUSTRIES LTD (Scrip Code: 530715) effective January 2, 2026 due to reduction of equity share capital under a Resolution Plan approved by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal, Allahabad Bench, Prayagraj. The company's subscribed and paid-up equity share capital will be reduced by 99% from Rs. 39,11,41,000 to Rs. 39,11,410, followed by a 10:1 share consolidation.

## Key Points

- Trading members advised not to deal in ALPS INDUSTRIES LTD equity shares from January 2, 2026
- Record date set as January 2, 2026 for capital reduction
- Resolution Plan approved by NCLT Allahabad Bench, Prayagraj
- Face value to be reduced from Rs. 10 per share to Rs. 0.10 per share (99% reduction)
- Total share capital reduced from Rs. 39,11,41,000 to Rs. 39,11,410
- Number of shares remains 3,91,14,100 after face value reduction
- Post-reduction consolidation: 10 shares of Rs. 0.10 each consolidated into 1 share of Re. 1 each
- Settlement Number: DR-790/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

This action is implemented under a Resolution Plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Allahabad Bench, Prayagraj. The capital restructuring involves both reduction and consolidation as part of the approved resolution framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in equity shares of ALPS INDUSTRIES LTD from January 2, 2026
- All trading members must note the suspension and ensure compliance with the no-dealing directive
- Record date compliance for capital reduction purposes: January 2, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 31, 2025
- **Record Date**: January 2, 2026
- **Trading Suspension Effective Date**: January 2, 2026
- **Settlement Number**: DR-790/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Extremely high impact on existing shareholders. The 99% capital reduction followed by 10:1 consolidation will result in shareholders holding only 1/10th of their original share count at a drastically reduced face value. For example, a shareholder with 100 shares of Rs. 10 face value will end up with 10 shares of Re. 1 face value after the entire process.

**Market Impact**: Trading suspension prevents any market transactions, eliminating liquidity completely. The restructuring under NCLT indicates the company is undergoing resolution proceedings, typically associated with financial distress.

**Operational Impact**: This corporate action is part of a resolution plan, suggesting significant operational and financial restructuring of the company. Investors should review the complete Resolution Plan for understanding the company's future structure and prospects.
