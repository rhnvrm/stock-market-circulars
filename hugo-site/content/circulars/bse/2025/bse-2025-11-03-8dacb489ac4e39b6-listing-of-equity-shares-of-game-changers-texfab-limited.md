## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this is a standard new listing announcement. The staggered lock-in periods will control the supply of shares entering the market over the next three years, with the first major unlock occurring in October 2025. Anchor investor lock-in expires earlier (December 2025 and February 2026), allowing partial liquidity. The listing of 103,057 free shares provides immediate trading liquidity.
