---

## Summary

BSE has directed trading members to cease dealings in partly paid equity shares of Fusion Finance Limited (Scrip Code 890214) effective from November 11, 2025. This suspension is due to the company fixing a record date to identify shareholders eligible to receive the First and Final call notice for partly paid-up equity shares.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies only to partly paid equity shares (Scrip Code 890214)
- Company has fixed record date to determine eligible shareholders for call notice
- First and Final call amount: Rs.65.50 per share (Rs.5.00 face value + Rs.60.50 premium)
- Settlement number: DR-753/2025-2026
- Trading members must comply with the no-dealings directive

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational measure taken when a company sets a record date for call money on partly paid shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in partly paid equity shares of Fusion Finance Limited from the specified date
- All trading members are required to take note of this directive and ensure compliance
- Only affects partly paid shares; fully paid shares (if any) are not impacted

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** November 7, 2025
- **Record Date:** November 11, 2025
- **No Dealings From:** November 11, 2025 (Settlement DR-753/2025-2026)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Limited to holders of partly paid equity shares of Fusion Finance Limited. This is a company-specific action affecting a narrow segment of shares.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their systems to block trades in the specified scrip code. Shareholders holding partly paid shares should prepare for the call payment of Rs.65.50 per share.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders of partly paid equity shares will receive the First and Final call notice and must pay the outstanding amount to convert their shares to fully paid status. Liquidity in these shares will be suspended from the record date.
