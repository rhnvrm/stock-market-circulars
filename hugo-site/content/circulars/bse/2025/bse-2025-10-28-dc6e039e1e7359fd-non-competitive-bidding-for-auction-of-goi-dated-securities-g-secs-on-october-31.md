## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine G-sec auction process that occurs regularly. The non-competitive bidding facility provides retail and smaller investors access to government securities auctions.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Standard operational procedure for trading members already familiar with the NCB-GSec module. No changes to existing processes.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for retail investors seeking to invest in government securities through the non-competitive route, providing guaranteed allocation (subject to maximum limits) without needing to participate in competitive price discovery.
