**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders as of the record date will have the opportunity to subscribe to additional shares at Rs. 80 per share, maintaining their proportional ownership. Non-participation will result in ownership dilution.

**Trading Impact**: Shares will trade ex-rights from October 31, 2025, likely resulting in price adjustment to reflect the rights entitlement separation. Market participants must account for this in their trading strategies.
