These shares were issued to non-promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to the conversion of warrants. The shares were allotted on August 13, 2025, at an issue price of Rs. 5.62 per share (Re. 1 face value plus Rs. 4.62 premium) and are subject to a lock-in period until May 31, 2026.

- 97,84,800 equity shares of Re. 1/- each to be listed
- Issued at premium of Rs. 4.62 per share (total issue price: Rs. 5.62)
- Allotted to non-promoters on preferential basis

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following SEBI preferential allotment regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to update their systems for the new securities
- All 97,84,800 shares are subject to lock-in restrictions until May 31, 2026
- Shares cannot be transferred or sold during the lock-in period as per regulatory requirements

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: August 13, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: December 1, 2025
- **Lock-in Period Ends**: May 31, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - The preferential allotment represents a capital raising exercise through warrant conversion. The shares were allotted several months ago (August 2025), so the market has already absorbed this information. The lock-in period until May 2026 ensures these shares will not immediately add to free float.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - Standard listing procedure for trading members. The shares rank pari-passu with existing equity, requiring no special treatment beyond lock-in compliance monitoring.

**Dilution Impact**: The additional 97.85 lakh shares will increase the total outstanding equity of PC Jeweller Limited, resulting in some dilution for existing shareholders, though the actual dilution percentage depends on the company's existing share capital.
