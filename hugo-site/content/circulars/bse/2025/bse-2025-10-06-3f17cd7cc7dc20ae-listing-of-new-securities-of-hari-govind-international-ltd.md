## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with limited market impact. The preferential issue increases the total equity base of Hari Govind International Ltd. by 28,57,500 shares. The staggered lock-in periods (until April 2026 and April 2027) will restrict immediate trading of these shares, minimizing short-term dilution impact. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new distribution numbers and lock-in restrictions.
