The minimum SIP amount has also been reduced from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100 for both funds. Additionally, monthly SIP frequency has been introduced for Axis Overnight Fund.

## Compliance Requirements

- Fund house must update all scheme documents with revised minimum amounts
- BSE StAR MF platform systems must be updated to reflect new minimum amounts
- Investors must be notified of the changes through proper channels
- All distributors and intermediaries must be informed of the revised provisions

## Impact Assessment

The reduction in minimum application amounts from Rs. 500 to Rs. 100 for lumpsum investments and from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100 for SIPs significantly lowers the entry barrier for retail investors. This change is expected to increase participation in liquid and overnight funds, particularly among small investors. The introduction of monthly SIP frequency for Axis Overnight Fund provides additional flexibility for investors seeking regular investment options.
