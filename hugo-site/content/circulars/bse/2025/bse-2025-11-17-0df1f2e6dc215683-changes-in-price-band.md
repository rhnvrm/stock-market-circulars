## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will directly impact intraday trading strategies and volatility management for the affected securities. Tighter bands (2%) indicate heightened surveillance and restricted price movement, while wider bands (20%) allow greater flexibility. Market participants trading these securities should adjust their risk management parameters and be aware of the revised circuit limits. The changes reflect BSE's ongoing surveillance efforts to maintain orderly market conditions.
