- Step-up rates apply from Put Option Date/Call Option Date until Maturity Date
- Modifications made to Clauses 2.3.2 (a) and 2.3.2 (b) of the Debenture Trust Deed

## Regulatory Changes

Amendment to the Debenture Trust Deed provisions governing coupon rate step-up mechanisms for both Series A and Series B Debentures, standardizing the step-up rate across both series at 0.25% per annum.

## Compliance Requirements

## Important Dates
