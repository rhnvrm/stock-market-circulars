---

## Summary

BSE has announced the new ISIN number INE531F01023 for NUVAMA WEALTH MANAGEMENT LTD (Scrip Code: 543988) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value Rs.10/- to Rs.2/- per share. This new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date of December 26, 2025. This notice is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251210-12 dated December 10, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN Number: INE531F01023 (replacing previous ISIN)
- Company: NUVAMA WEALTH MANAGEMENT LTD
- Scrip Code: 543988
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Rs.2/- per share
- Ex-Date: December 26, 2025
- Document Reference: DR-785/2025-2026
- Notice references earlier communication dated December 10, 2025 (Notice No. 20251210-12)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action requiring ISIN update to reflect the new face value of equity shares post sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number INE531F01023 before the ex-date
- All trades executed on or after December 26, 2025 must use the new ISIN
- Brokers and trading platforms should ensure proper mapping of the old and new ISIN for client holdings
- Depositories (NSDL/CDSL) will reflect the sub-divided shares with new ISIN in demat accounts

## Important Dates

- **December 17, 2025**: Notice date and announcement of new ISIN
- **December 26, 2025**: Ex-date - new ISIN becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Moderate. The stock sub-division makes shares more affordable at a lower price point, potentially increasing liquidity and retail participation. Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares of Rs.2/- for every 1 share of Rs.10/- held.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants must ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN before December 26, 2025, to avoid trade disruptions. The sub-division does not change the total market capitalization or proportional ownership of existing shareholders.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for retail investors as lower-priced shares improve accessibility. No action required from shareholders as the sub-division and ISIN change will be processed automatically by depositories.
