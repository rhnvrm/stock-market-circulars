## Summary

## Key Points

- Shree Manufacturing Company Ltd (503863, INE632A01012) moved to GSM Stage I
- Eurotex Industries and Exports Ltd (521014, INE022C01012) moved to GSM Stage I
- Space Incubatrics Technologies Ltd (541890, INE797Z01010) moved to GSM Stage III

- Securities marked with (#) move to lower GSM stages due to ESM Framework inclusion

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements the existing GSM framework which applies graded surveillance measures to securities based on specific criteria to protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the GSM stage classification of these securities
- Enhanced disclosure requirements apply based on GSM stage
- Price bands and other trading restrictions specific to each GSM stage will be applicable
- Investors should be made aware of the surveillance status before trading

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: October 31, 2025
- The GSM stage changes are applicable immediately from the date of this circular

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The movement to higher GSM stages typically results in reduced liquidity and stricter trading conditions for the affected securities. Stage IV classification for Yaari Digital indicates the highest level of surveillance concern.

**Investor Impact:** Investors in these securities will face additional restrictions including potential price bands, higher margin requirements, and trade-for-trade settlement depending on the GSM stage.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new GSM classifications and ensure appropriate risk management measures are in place for clients trading these securities.
