## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in non-convertible debentures (ISIN: INE0QVA07019, Code: 975730) of Lumbini Education Pvt Ltd effective December 16, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for early redemption of these debentures. Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from December 16, 2025 onwards.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This affects only holders of specific privately placed debentures of Lumbini Education Pvt Ltd. The suspension is procedural for early redemption.

**Investor Impact**: Low to Medium for debenture holders. Investors will receive early redemption proceeds, which may require reinvestment planning. The 16% coupon rate suggests these were high-yield securities, and reinvestment at similar rates may be challenging.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Standard corporate action process for debt securities with clear timelines provided to market participants.
