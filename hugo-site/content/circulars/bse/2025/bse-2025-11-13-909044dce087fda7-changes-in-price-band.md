## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands from November 14, 2025
- All trading systems must be updated to reflect new price band limits
- Members requiring clarifications should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Trading within the new bands is mandatory for all market participants

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** November 13, 2025
- **Effective Date:** November 14, 2025
- **Notice Number:** 20251113-59

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:**
- Securities with narrower bands (5%) will experience limited intraday price movement, potentially reducing volatility and protecting investors
- TVS Holdings with 20% band gains significantly higher trading flexibility, allowing broader price discovery
- Tighter bands on scrips like Epuja Spiritech, HCP Plastene Bulkpack, and Retaggio Industries suggest heightened surveillance concerns

**Market Participants:**
- Traders and investors in these securities must adjust strategies to account for new price movement limits
- Algorithmic trading systems require recalibration for revised parameters
- Higher bands facilitate better liquidity while tighter bands may constrain trading activity

**Surveillance Perspective:**
The varied price bands indicate differentiated risk assessments, with tighter controls on potentially volatile securities and relaxed limits on more stable stocks like TVS Holdings.
