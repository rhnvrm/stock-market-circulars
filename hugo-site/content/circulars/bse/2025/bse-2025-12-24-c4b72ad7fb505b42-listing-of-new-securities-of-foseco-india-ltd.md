## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The preferential issue represents capital raising by Foseco India Ltd at a significant premium (Rs. 5,664.12 over face value of Rs. 10), indicating strong investor confidence. However, the impact on secondary market trading will be minimal in the near term due to the complete lock-in of all allotted shares until June 30, 2026.

**Dilution**: The addition of 11.5 lakh shares will increase the equity base, though the exact dilution percentage depends on the existing share capital. The lock-in period provides stability by preventing immediate sell pressure.

**Investor Consideration**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution from this preferential issue. The high premium suggests positive valuation, while the lock-in period indicates medium-term commitment from allottees.
