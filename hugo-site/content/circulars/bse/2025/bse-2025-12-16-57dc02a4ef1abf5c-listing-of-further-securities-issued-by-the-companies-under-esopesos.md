title: Listing of Further Securities Issued Under ESOP/ESOS by 29 Companies
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the listing and admission for trading of further securities issued by 29 companies under their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). These new securities will be listed and available for trading on the Exchange with effect from Wednesday, December 17, 2025. All listed securities have no lock-in period restrictions.

## Key Points

- 29 companies have issued new securities under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Total of 3,004,333 shares across all companies
- Face values range from Re 1 to Rs 10 per share
- Effective trading date: December 17, 2025
- No lock-in period applicable for any of the listed securities
- Largest issuances: Le Travenues Technology Limited (905,489 shares), PB Fintech Limited (682,752 shares), and Aditya Birla Capital Limited (434,391 shares)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should update their systems to reflect the new securities and updated share capital
- Trading members should note the distinct numbering ranges (Dist. Nos. From and To) for each company's new issuance
- Companies must ensure proper dematerialization and ISIN assignment for the newly listed securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 16, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date**: December 17, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not Applicable (NA) for all securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The issuance represents routine ESOP/ESOS conversions with relatively small quantities compared to the outstanding share capital of most companies. The immediate dilution effect is minimal.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible. The additional shares may marginally increase floating stock but are unlikely to significantly affect trading volumes or liquidity.

**Investor Impact**: Neutral to slightly dilutive for existing shareholders, though the impact is minimal given the small percentages involved. These issuances are part of normal compensation practices and were likely already accounted for in diluted earnings calculations.

**Trading Considerations**: No lock-in restrictions mean all securities are immediately tradeable, though employee-held shares may not immediately enter the market depending on individual vesting schedules and employee decisions.
