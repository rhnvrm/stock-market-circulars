These securities will be listed and available for trading effective Monday, November 3, 2025. The listings include shares from major companies such as AXIS Bank (188,287 shares), CG Power (40,000 shares), and Kotak Mahindra Bank (37,598 shares). None of the newly listed securities are subject to lock-in restrictions.

## Key Points

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to recognize the newly listed securities
- Companies must ensure accurate ISIN and scrip code mapping
- No special compliance requirements for investors as securities are immediately tradable with no restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 31, 2025
- **Listing Effective Date**: Monday, November 3, 2025
- **Lock-in Period**: None (NA for all companies)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - These are routine ESOP listings with relatively small quantities that represent minor dilution to existing share capital. The largest issuance of 188,287 shares by AXIS Bank is minimal compared to the bank's total outstanding shares.

**Trading Impact**: Minimal - The additional shares will be immediately available for trading without lock-in restrictions, but the quantities are unlikely to materially affect liquidity or price discovery.

**Investor Impact**: Low - Existing shareholders may experience negligible dilution. The listings indicate companies are actively using employee incentive programs, which is generally positive for corporate governance and talent retention.

**Companies Affected**: AXIS Bank, CG Power and Industrial Solutions, D.B. Corp, Hexaware Technologies, Kansai Nerolac Paints, Kirloskar Oil Engines, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Lodha Developers, Solara Active Pharma Sciences, Sterlite Technologies, VA Tech Wabag, and Vardhman Special Steels.
