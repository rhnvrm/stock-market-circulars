title: Changes in Price Band for 99 Securities Effective September 1, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced revision of price bands for 99 securities effective from September 1, 2025. The price bands range from 2% to 20%, indicating varying levels of volatility control measures being applied to these scrips.

## Key Points

- 99 securities will have revised price bands effective September 1, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% (Elango Industries) to 20% (multiple securities)
- Most securities (approximately 60%) have been assigned a 5% price band
- Changes apply to equity segment trading
- Notice issued on August 29, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions represent enhanced surveillance measures to control excessive volatility in specific securities. The bands limit daily price movement within specified percentages.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands
- All trades must execute within the new price band limits
- System updates required before September 1, 2025 effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: August 29, 2025
- **Effective Date**: September 1, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will limit intraday volatility for the affected securities, providing better price discovery and risk management. Securities with tighter bands (2-5%) may see reduced speculative activity, while those with 20% bands still allow significant price movement. This measure enhances market stability for these particular scrips while maintaining liquidity.
