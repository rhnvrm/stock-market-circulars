**Investor Impact:** Low to medium for debt investors. The NCDs offer yields between 9.71% and 11.73%, providing investment options across different tenures (2 to 7 years). The BBB rating indicates moderate credit quality with adequate safety, suitable for conservative to moderate risk investors.

**Risk Factors:** Credit risk as per IND BBB rating; interest rate risk for longer tenure NCDs; no put/call options limit early exit flexibility.
