## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is an operational adjustment to the trading calendar to accommodate the Good Friday holiday in April 2026.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised expiry dates for contract settlement planning
- Members should update their systems and inform clients about the modified expiry schedule
- Position management and rollover strategies should account for the one-day advance in expiry dates

## Important Dates

- **Original Gold & Silver Futures Expiry**: April 3, 2026
- **Revised Gold & Silver Futures Expiry**: April 2, 2026
- **Original Gold & Silver Options on Futures Expiry**: March 25, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The impact is moderate and primarily affects commodity derivatives market participants holding Gold and Silver Futures and Options positions scheduled to expire in late March and early April 2026. Traders will need to adjust their rollover strategies and position management timelines by one day. The advance notice provided (over three months) allows adequate time for market participants to adapt their trading strategies and settlement procedures.
