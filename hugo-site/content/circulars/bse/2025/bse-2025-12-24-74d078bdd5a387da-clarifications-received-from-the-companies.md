## Summary

BSE sought clarifications from Prism Johnson Limited and Puravankara Limited regarding significant increases in trading volumes of their securities. Both companies responded that there is no undisclosed material information and attributed the volume changes to prevailing market conditions and legitimate business activities.

## Key Points

- **Prism Johnson Limited (Code: 500338)**: Confirmed no undisclosed material information or impending announcements that would affect price/volume behavior
- **Puravankara Limited**: Attributed volume increase to announcement on December 23, 2025 regarding acquisition of 53 acres of land in Bengaluru with potential GDV of Rs. 4,800 Crores
- Both companies confirmed compliance with Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015
- Companies stated they have made all necessary disclosures and continue to disseminate price-sensitive information promptly
- Volume increases attributed to market conditions and normal business development activities

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must respond to BSE surveillance queries regarding unusual price/volume movements
- Entities must confirm whether any undisclosed material information exists that could affect price/volume behavior
- Continued adherence to Regulation 30 disclosure requirements for material events and price-sensitive information
- Companies must disclose information through exchanges before making it public

## Important Dates

- **December 24, 2025**: Date of clarification letters from both companies
- **December 23, 2025**: Puravankara announced land acquisition in Bengaluru

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - Both companies confirmed no undisclosed material information, indicating volume increases are due to normal market activity and disclosed business developments.

**Operational Impact**: Low - This is a routine surveillance matter with no adverse findings or compliance issues identified.

**Investor Impact**: Puravankara's land acquisition announcement (Rs. 4,800 Crores potential GDV) may have driven legitimate investor interest. Prism Johnson's volume increase appears purely market-driven with no specific catalyst disclosed.
