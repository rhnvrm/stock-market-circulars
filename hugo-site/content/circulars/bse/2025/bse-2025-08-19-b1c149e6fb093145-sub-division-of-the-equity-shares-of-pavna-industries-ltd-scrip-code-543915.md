## Summary

Pavna Industries Ltd has announced a sub-division of its equity shares from Rs.10/- per share to Re.1/- per share in a 1:10 ratio, with the record date set for September 1, 2025.

## Key Points

- Sub-division ratio: 1 equity share of Rs.10/- becomes 10 equity shares of Re.1/- each
- Record date: September 1, 2025
- Effective date: September 1, 2025
- Current ISIN INE07S101020 (Rs.10 paid-up) will become invalid from September 1, 2025
- New ISIN for Re.1 paid-up shares to be announced separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE07S101020 for Rs.10/- paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after September 1, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date and effective date for the sub-division
- Market participants should await separate notice for new ISIN number
- All transactions involving the company's shares must account for the sub-division from the effective date

## Important Dates

- Record Date: September 1, 2025
- Effective Date: September 1, 2025
- Notice Date: August 19, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The sub-division will increase the number of shares outstanding by 10 times while proportionally reducing the face value. This typically makes shares more affordable for retail investors and may improve liquidity. The share price will adjust proportionally on the effective date.
