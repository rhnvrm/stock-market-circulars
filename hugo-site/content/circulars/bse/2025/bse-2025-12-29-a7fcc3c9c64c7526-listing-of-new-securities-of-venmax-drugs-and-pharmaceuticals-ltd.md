## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing notification for a single company's preferential allotment. The total number of shares (27.69 lakhs) represents a capital infusion from warrant conversion.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Trading members need to update their systems to recognize the new shares with appropriate lock-in restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: The lock-in period until July 13, 2026 ensures that non-promoter allottees cannot immediately exit, providing price stability. The preferential issue at Rs. 20/- provides information on recent valuation for existing and potential investors.

**Liquidity Impact**: Neutral to slightly positive. While 27.69 lakh new shares are added to the equity base, the lock-in restricts their tradability for approximately 6-7 months, limiting immediate float expansion.
