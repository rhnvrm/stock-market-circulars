## Lock-in Details

| Allotment Date | Number of Shares | Distribution Numbers | Lock-in Until |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| November 17, 2025 | 48,22,891 | 1554816271 - 1559579161 | June 10, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium. The preferential allotment of approximately 8.96 lakh shares represents a dilution for existing shareholders. However, since the allotment is to non-promoters with lock-in until June 2026, immediate selling pressure is limited.

**Liquidity Impact:** The locked-in shares will not be available for trading until June 10, 2026, temporarily limiting the impact on float. Post lock-in expiry, the increased float may improve liquidity.

**Price Impact:** The issue price of Rs. 111.51 provides a reference point for valuation. The premium of Rs. 109.51 over face value indicates investor confidence at that pricing level.

**Corporate Action:** This represents capital raising through warrant conversion, strengthening the company's equity base. The funds raised (approximately Rs. 99.91 crores) will support the company's growth plans.
