title: Changes in Settlement Schedule Corporate Debt Segment - September 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the settlement schedule for the Corporate Debt segment following RBI's announcement of holiday change from September 05, 2025 to September 08, 2025. The revision ensures continuity of settlement operations while accommodating the holiday schedule change.

## Key Points

- Settlement schedule revised for September 2025 due to RBI holiday announcement
- Trades originally due for settlement on September 08, 2025 will now settle on September 09, 2025
- All trades maintain the same consideration amounts despite date changes
- Special settlement arrangements for September 05, 2025 transactions

## Regulatory Changes

Following RBI press release dated September 04, 2025, the holiday has been changed from September 05, 2025 to September 08, 2025, necessitating adjustments to the corporate debt settlement calendar.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised settlement dates for corporate debt transactions
- All T+0, T+1, and T+2 settlement cycles affected by the holiday change
- Settlement number 2526500 applies to all settlement types on September 05, 2025

## Important Dates

- **September 04, 2025**: T+1 settlements moved from September 08 to September 09
- **September 05, 2025**: All settlement types (T+0, T+1, T+2) will operate with settlement number 2526500
- **September 09, 2025**: New settlement date for trades originally scheduled for September 08
- **September 10, 2025**: T+2 settlement date for September 05 trades

## Impact Assessment

The settlement schedule changes affect corporate debt market operations with minimal disruption as consideration amounts remain unchanged. Market participants need to adjust their settlement expectations for early September transactions, particularly those involving T+1 and T+2 cycles around the holiday period.
