title: Listing of Further Securities Issued Under ESOP/ESOS by 16 Companies
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the listing and admission for trading of further securities issued by 16 companies under their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). The new shares will be listed and available for trading with effect from Tuesday, December 30, 2025. The circular provides details of the number of shares, face values, ISIN codes, and lock-in periods where applicable.

## Key Points

- 16 companies are listing additional equity shares issued under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Total shares being listed: 1,427,472 shares across all companies
- Effective listing date: December 30, 2025
- ITC Ltd is issuing the highest number of shares (195,210 shares)
- UNICOMMERCE ESOLUTIONS LIMITED is issuing 1,017,088 shares
- Some securities have lock-in periods (Bliss GVS Pharma Limited locked until June 9, 2025)
- All other securities have no lock-in restrictions (NA)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must take note of the new securities being listed
- Trading systems should be updated to reflect the additional shares for each company
- Companies must ensure compliance with existing ESOP/ESOS regulations and disclosure requirements

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 29, 2025
- **Listing Effective Date**: December 30, 2025 (Tuesday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: June 9, 2025 for Bliss GVS Pharma Limited (Scrip Code: 506197)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine corporate action that results in minor dilution of existing shareholding. The number of shares being listed represents a small fraction of the outstanding shares for most companies.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Market participants need to update their systems to reflect the increased share capital, but this is a standard operational procedure.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may experience minimal dilution. The lock-in period for Bliss GVS Pharma Limited provides some protection against immediate selling pressure. For all other companies, shares are immediately tradeable with no restrictions.
