---

## Summary

BEML Ltd (Scrip Code: 500048) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs. 10/- will be sub-divided into two equity shares with a face value of Rs. 5/- each. The record date for this corporate action is November 3, 2025, and the new share structure will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Company: BEML Ltd (Scrip Code: 500048)
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Sub-division Ratio: 1 share of Rs. 10/- into 2 shares of Rs. 5/- each
- Record Date: November 3, 2025
- Effective Date: November 3, 2025
- Security Type: Dematerialised Securities – Rolling Settlement
- Notice Reference: DR-748/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes are introduced by this circular. This is a standard corporate action notification for stock sub-division in compliance with existing BSE listing requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date and effective date for the sub-division
- All transactions must reflect the new share structure from November 3, 2025
- The existing ISIN No. INE258A01016 (Rs. 10/- paid up) will cease to be valid for exchange transactions from October 28, 2025
- Market participants must await separate notice for the new ISIN number applicable to Rs. 5/- paid-up shares

## Important Dates

- **October 14, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **October 28, 2025**: Last date for trading under old ISIN INE258A01016 (Rs. 10/- paid up)
- **November 3, 2025**: Record date and effective date for sub-division
- **November 3, 2025**: New share structure becomes effective for trading

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Each shareholder will receive two shares of Rs. 5/- face value for every one share of Rs. 10/- face value held. This doubles the number of shares held but maintains the same total investment value.

**Trading Impact**: The sub-division will result in a lower price per share (approximately half), potentially improving liquidity and making shares more accessible to retail investors. The old ISIN will be invalid from October 28, 2025, requiring system updates.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers, depositories, and trading systems must update their records to reflect the new ISIN and share structure. There will be a brief transition period between October 28 and November 3, 2025, where the old ISIN becomes invalid and before the new structure is fully effective.

**Market Sentiment**: Stock sub-divisions are generally viewed positively as they improve affordability and liquidity, though they do not change the fundamental value of the company.
