title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework applicable from November 17, 2025. Seven securities are being newly shortlisted under the ST-ASM 5/15/30 Days framework (Stage I), while twelve securities are moving out of the framework due to migration to other surveillance categories or frameworks. The circular includes a consolidated list of all securities currently under ST-ASM surveillance.

## Key Points

- 7 securities newly entering ST-ASM framework (Stage I) including 2 SME scrips
- 12 securities exiting ST-ASM framework for various reasons
- 4 securities moving to Trade for Trade framework
- 3 securities transitioning to LT-ASM framework
- 2 SME scrips among exits, 1 moving to ESM framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower stages within ST-ASM
- Consolidated list provided showing all active ST-ASM securities with stage classifications
- Framework includes securities marked with specific identifiers for NSE alignment, SME status, and T+0 trading

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues BSE's enhanced surveillance mechanism for securities exhibiting unusual price movements or volatility. Securities under this framework face additional trading restrictions including:

- Enhanced margin requirements
- Price bands limitations
- Restricted intraday trading depending on stage
- Progressive escalation through Stage I, II, and III based on continued volatility

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Limited overall market impact as measures affect only 19 securities in current update
- Enhanced surveillance may reduce speculative trading in affected securities
- Potential temporary liquidity reduction in newly listed ST-ASM securities
- Exit of 12 securities provides regulatory relief and may improve liquidity

**Trading Impact:**
- Securities entering ST-ASM will face higher transaction costs due to margin requirements
- Intraday traders may avoid ST-ASM securities due to restrictions
- Price discovery may be temporarily affected for new entrants
- Securities exiting ST-ASM should see improved trading activity

**Investor Impact:**
- Retail investors need to maintain higher margins for ST-ASM securities
- Long-term investors less affected than short-term traders
- Enhanced surveillance provides some protection against excessive volatility
- Portfolio adjustments may be needed for compliance with margin requirements

**Regulatory Significance:**
- Demonstrates ongoing monitoring of market volatility by BSE
- Part of broader surveillance framework including GSM, ESM, and LT-ASM
- Alignment with NSE on specific securities (Indigo Paints, Venus Remedies) shows inter-exchange coordination
- SME securities receiving special attention with 2 entries and 2 exits
