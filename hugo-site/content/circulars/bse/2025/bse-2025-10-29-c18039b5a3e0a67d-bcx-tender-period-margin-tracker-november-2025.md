- SILVER contracts expiring November 5, 2025 follow the same October 30 to November 5 schedule
- SILVERKG and SILVERM contracts expiring November 28, 2025 have tender period from November 24 to November 28
- Margins increase progressively: 5% → 10% → 15% → 20% → 25%
- November 1-2, 2025 are holidays (no margin changes during these days)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects participants in commodity derivatives segment, particularly those holding positions near expiry. The progressive margin structure encourages early position squaring.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure margin collection systems are updated with the escalating requirements. Clients maintaining positions through tender period will face increased margin obligations, potentially affecting liquidity and position management strategies.

**Financial Impact:** Traders holding positions closer to expiry will need to allocate additional capital to meet margin requirements, with margins increasing 5x from initial 5% to final 25%.
