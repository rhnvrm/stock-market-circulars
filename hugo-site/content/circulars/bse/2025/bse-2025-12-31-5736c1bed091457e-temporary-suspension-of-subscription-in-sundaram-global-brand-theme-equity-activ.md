## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Investors:**
- New investors cannot enter the scheme from January 1, 2026
- Existing SIP investors can continue their investments
- Exit options remain fully available through redemptions and systematic withdrawal plans
- Investors seeking exposure to global brand themes through this FoF will need to wait for suspension lifting

- Limited to specific fund investors; no broader market impact
- Reflects industry-wide constraint on overseas investments due to regulatory limits
- Similar measures may be adopted by other FoFs investing in overseas securities if limits are approached

**Operational Impact:**
- Sundaram AMC must implement transaction blocking systems from January 1, 2026
- Units allotment will be restricted except for pre-existing systematic plans and redemptions
- The temporary nature suggests resumption once RBI/SEBI enhance overseas investment limits
