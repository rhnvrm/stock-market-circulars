## Impact Assessment

This is a routine commercial paper listing with minimal market impact. Commercial papers are short-term unsecured debt instruments typically used by companies for working capital needs. The CARE A1+ rating indicates strong credit quality. The issuance provides Jindal Saw Limited with short-term funding at competitive rates (implied yield approximately 6.4% annualized based on discount to face value). For investors, this offers a short-tenor debt instrument backed by a creditworthy issuer. Trading is restricted to institutional and high net-worth investors due to the Rs. 5 lakh minimum lot size.
