- Action taken under SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015, Regulation 14
- Continuation of Exchange's compliance enforcement from previous notices dated June 25, 2021 and June 20, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements existing SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, specifically Regulation 14 regarding Annual Listing Fees payment requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised trading status of the mentioned companies
- Companies must maintain compliance with Annual Listing Fee payment requirements
- Ongoing monitoring of ALF compliance for all listed entities

## Important Dates
