## Summary

BSE has announced updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective November 03, 2025. The circular identifies securities being newly added to LT-ASM, those being moved to higher or lower ASM stages within the framework, securities moving directly to Stage IV, and those being removed from the framework. One security (PPAP Automotive Ltd) is being newly shortlisted, 9 securities are being moved to lower ASM stages, and 16 securities are being removed from the LT-ASM framework.

## Key Points

- **Part A**: 1 security newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework - PPAP Automotive Ltd (Scrip Code: 532934, ISIN: INE095I01015)
- **Part B**: No securities moving to higher ASM stages
- **Part C**: 9 securities moving to lower ASM stages, including 7 moving to Stage I, 1 to Stage II, and 1 to Stage III
- **Part D**: No securities being placed directly in Stage IV Long Term ASM Framework
- **Annexure II**: 16 securities moving out of Long Term ASM Framework entirely
- Several securities removed from LT-ASM due to inclusion in other frameworks (Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, IBC)
- All changes effective from November 03, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework continues to operate as a surveillance mechanism for securities exhibiting certain risk characteristics. The framework operates in multiple stages with progressively stricter surveillance measures. Securities can be:

- Newly added to the framework
- Moved between stages (I, II, III, IV) based on changing risk profiles
- Removed from the framework when risk factors normalize or when transferred to other surveillance frameworks

Special markers indicate specific conditions:
- (*) As per NSE alignment
- (^) As per Non Promoter Holding criteria
- (~) T+0 Scrips shortlisted based on parent company criteria

## Compliance Requirements

- **Market Participants**: Must be aware of the surveillance status of securities they trade
- **Trading Members**: Should ensure systems are updated to reflect the new ASM stages for affected securities
- **Investors**: Securities under LT-ASM may have additional trading restrictions including:
  - Price bands
  - Trade-for-trade settlement
  - Additional margin requirements
  - Reduced position limits
- All participants must comply with the revised surveillance measures from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 03, 2025 - All changes to LT-ASM framework become applicable
- **Circular Date**: October 31, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The changes affect 26 securities across various stages of the LT-ASM framework. While this represents a limited subset of listed securities, the surveillance measures can significantly impact liquidity and trading patterns for the affected stocks.

**Securities Moving to Lower Stages**: 9 securities are being moved to less restrictive surveillance stages, which is positive as it indicates improved risk profiles. This should enhance liquidity and ease trading restrictions for these stocks.

**Securities Exiting LT-ASM**: 16 securities are being removed from the framework, with several transitioning to other surveillance frameworks (Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, IBC). While removal from LT-ASM is generally positive, transition to other frameworks may still involve trading restrictions.

**New Entry**: PPAP Automotive Ltd being newly added to LT-ASM indicates concerns requiring enhanced surveillance, which may increase volatility or trading costs for this security.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market infrastructure providers need to update their systems to reflect the new surveillance parameters for all affected securities before November 03, 2025.
