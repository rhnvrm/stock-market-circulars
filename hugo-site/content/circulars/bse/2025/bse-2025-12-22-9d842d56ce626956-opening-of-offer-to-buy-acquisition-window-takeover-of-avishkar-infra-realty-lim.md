## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Public Shareholders**: This mandatory open offer provides an exit opportunity for public shareholders at ₹16.00 per share following the change in control triggered by preferential allotment. The acquirer group now holds 26.78% of expanded capital, and the open offer targets an additional 26% acquisition.

**Corporate Control**: The transaction represents a significant change in the ownership structure of Avishkar Infra Realty Limited, with the acquirer group seeking to consolidate substantial holding through the preferential route followed by the open offer.

**Financial Obligation**: The inclusion of 10% annual interest for delayed payment indicates the offer is being made with compensation for non-compliance with original timelines under SEBI regulations.

**Market Liquidity**: Public shareholders gain liquidity opportunity in what may be a thinly traded stock, with assured exit at the stated price without minimum acceptance conditions.
