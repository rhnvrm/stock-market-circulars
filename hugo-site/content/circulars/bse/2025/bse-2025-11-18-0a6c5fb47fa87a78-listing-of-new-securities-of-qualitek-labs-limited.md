## Impact Assessment

This is a routine preferential allotment listing with minimal market impact. The shares represent additional equity capital raised by Qualitek Labs Limited. The lock-in periods ensure that a significant portion of these shares (70% locked until 2027 and 30% until 2026) cannot be immediately traded, limiting short-term supply pressure on the stock.
