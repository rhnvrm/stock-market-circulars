## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine debt market operation affecting only participants in government securities trading. The non-competitive bidding facility provides retail and smaller investors access to SDL auctions without competing on yield.

**Operational Impact**: Medium for debt market participants - Trading members and direct investors interested in state government securities need to prepare bids and ensure system access to the iBBS NCB-GSec module within tight timelines.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for debt investors - Provides opportunity to invest in state government securities across 11 states with varying tenures (2032-2045) and yields (7.09%-7.51% for re-issues). The non-competitive route simplifies participation for retail investors.
