## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a company-specific listing event for preferential shares. The listing adds approximately 16.73 lakh shares to the tradeable float of Qualitek Labs Limited, though a significant portion (70% of the issue) remains locked-in until 2027.

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal immediate impact as only 501,650 shares (30% of the issue) will become freely tradeable by May 2026, with the remaining 70% locked until May 2027.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders should note the dilution from the preferential issue. The issue price of Rs. 310.89 provides a reference point for the company's recent valuation. The staggered lock-in periods suggest differential treatment between promoter and non-promoter allottees.
