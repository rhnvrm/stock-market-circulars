**Market Impact**: Medium - This is a substantial Rs. 32,000 crore G-sec auction that will impact liquidity in the debt market. The re-issuance of three securities across different maturity profiles (2028, 2032, 2055) provides investment options for various investor categories.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members participating in debt market operations need to ensure timely bid submission through the NCB-GSec module. The non-competitive bidding facility allows retail and smaller investors to participate in government securities auctions without competing on price.
