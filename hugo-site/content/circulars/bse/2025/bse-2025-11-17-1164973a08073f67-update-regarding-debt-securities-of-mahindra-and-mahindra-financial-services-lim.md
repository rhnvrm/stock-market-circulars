## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members are requested to note the new ISIN and paid-up value for the debt securities
- Members must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN (INE774D07VM4) and revised paid-up value (Rs. 1,00,000/- per debenture)

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** November 17, 2025
- **Effective Date:** November 18, 2025 (Tuesday) - New ISIN and paid-up value become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Debenture Holders:** Existing debenture holders of Mahindra And Mahindra Financial Services Limited will see their holdings reflected under the new ISIN with significantly higher paid-up value (1000x increase from Rs. 100 to Rs. 1,00,000 per debenture).

**Trading Members:** Must update trading systems and records to accommodate the ISIN change and new paid-up value to ensure accurate trading and settlement.

**Market Impact:** Limited broader market impact as this is a specific update related to one company's debt securities. The change in paid-up value appears to be a consolidation of debenture units following receipt of call money.
