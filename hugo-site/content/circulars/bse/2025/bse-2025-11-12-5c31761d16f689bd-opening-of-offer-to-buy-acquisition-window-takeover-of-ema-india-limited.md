## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Eligible equity shareholders of EMA India Limited have the opportunity to tender their shares at Rs 124 per share. This represents a takeover situation where the acquirer group is seeking to increase their stake by 26% of voting capital.

**Market Impact**: The open offer signals a significant ownership change in EMA India Limited. The acquirer group (Dynalog India Limited and Adhalrao family) is consolidating control, which may lead to changes in company management and strategic direction.

**Trading Impact**: Shareholders should evaluate the offer price of Rs 124 against current market price and their investment objectives. The unconditional nature of the offer (no minimum acceptance threshold) provides certainty of execution for participating shareholders.

**Corporate Governance**: The acquisition window takeover under SEBI SAST regulations ensures minority shareholder protection through mandatory offer disclosure and fair pricing mechanisms.
