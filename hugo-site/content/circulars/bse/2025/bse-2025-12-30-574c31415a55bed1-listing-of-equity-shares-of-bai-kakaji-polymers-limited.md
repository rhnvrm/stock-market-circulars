## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The listing adds 21.4 million shares to the market with staggered availability due to lock-in periods. Immediate tradable float is limited to 4,046,400 shares (18.9% of total), which may impact liquidity and price discovery in the initial trading period.

**Operational Impact**: Lock-in mechanisms ensure gradual supply increase over 3+ years, potentially supporting price stability. Anchor investor allocations (7.5% of total) have short lock-ins, providing early liquidity boost within 3-4 months post-listing.
