The suspension is being implemented to facilitate redemption of debentures and payment of interest to eligible holders as per the record date set by the company. Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspended for ABCL 6.25% debentures maturing December 25, 2025 (ISIN: INE860H07HD0, Code: 960355)
- Record date fixed as December 8, 2025 for determining eligible debenture holders
- Suspension effective from December 8, 2025
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Notice issued under reference number DR-772/2025-2026
- Trading members explicitly instructed not to deal in these debentures from suspension date

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational procedure for corporate actions related to debt securities redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified ABCL debentures (ISIN: INE860H07HD0) from December 8, 2025
- Trading members must inform their clients holding these debentures about the trading suspension
- Members must ensure compliance with the no-dealings restriction to avoid potential penalties

## Important Dates

- **November 25, 2025**: Circular issued by BSE
- **December 8, 2025**: Record date for determining eligible debenture holders
- **December 8, 2025**: Trading suspension begins (no dealings from this date)
- **December 25, 2025**: Debenture maturity date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of this specific ABCL debenture series. The suspension affects only one debt security (ISIN: INE860H07HD0) and does not impact the company's equity shares or other debt instruments.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders as of the record date will receive their final interest payment and principal redemption amount. Secondary market liquidity for this instrument will be unavailable from December 8, 2025, but this is expected given the proximity to maturity date.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to block trading in this specific ISIN from December 8, 2025 and communicate with affected clients regarding the suspension and upcoming redemption.
