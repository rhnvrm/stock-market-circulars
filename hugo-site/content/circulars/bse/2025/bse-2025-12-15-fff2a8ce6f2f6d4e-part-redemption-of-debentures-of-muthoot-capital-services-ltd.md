## Impact Assessment

This corporate action has limited market impact as it affects only holders of specific non-convertible debentures issued by Muthoot Capital Services Ltd. The part redemption reduces the outstanding face value of the debentures, and investors will receive partial principal repayment along with interest. Trading members dealing in this debt instrument need to update their systems to reflect the new reduced face value from the effective date.
