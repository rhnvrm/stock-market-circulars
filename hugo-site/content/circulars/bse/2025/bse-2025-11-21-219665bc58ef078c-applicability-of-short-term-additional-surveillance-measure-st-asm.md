## Regulatory Framework

The Short Term ASM framework operates with three stages (5/15/30 days) designed to curb excessive speculation and maintain orderly trading. Securities under this framework face enhanced surveillance based on price movements, volatility, and trading patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ST-ASM framework requirements for affected securities
- Enhanced margin and surveillance measures apply to all securities listed under ST-ASM
- Market participants should review positions in affected securities before the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 24, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 6 securities to ST-ASM indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny due to unusual price movements or trading patterns. Securities under ST-ASM typically experience reduced liquidity and higher transaction costs. The removal of 7 securities, particularly AVI Polymers Ltd moving to the more stringent ESM framework, reflects ongoing market surveillance actions. Investors and traders in these securities should be aware of potential trading restrictions and enhanced margin requirements.
