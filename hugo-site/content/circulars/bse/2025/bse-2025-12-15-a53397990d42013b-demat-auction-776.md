- Auction participants must ensure adequate funds/securities availability
- Settlement obligations must be fulfilled as per exchange timelines
- Members with delivery failures may face penalties and charges as per SEBI/BSE regulations

**Investor Impact**: Low to Medium - Primarily affects investors/traders who had pending delivery obligations. Buying clients receive their securities through the auction mechanism, though timing may be delayed.
