## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: All existing Futures and Options contracts on Adani Enterprises Ltd will undergo mandatory adjustments affecting strike prices and contract sizes. This will impact all open positions held by traders and investors in ADEL derivatives.

**Operational Impact**: 
- Strike prices will be adjusted downward by multiplying by factor 0.970403 (e.g., 1900 strike becomes 1843.75, 1950 strike becomes 1892.30)
- Market lot size increases from 300 to 309 contracts
- Trading systems and risk management systems must accommodate the new contract specifications
- Position holders need to recalculate their exposure based on new lot sizes and strike prices

**Example Calculation**:
- Adjustment Factor = (P-E)/P where P = spot price on last cum date, E = benefits per share
- Benefits per share (E) = (P-S) × Rights Entitlement / Total Entitlement = (2487-1800) × 3 / 28 = Rs. 73.607143
- Adjustment Factor = (2487 - 73.607143) / 2487 = 0.970403
