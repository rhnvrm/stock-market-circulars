## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The issuance of approximately 1.63 crore new equity shares represents a significant addition to the existing share capital of Thirumalai Chemicals Ltd. This could lead to dilution for existing shareholders.

**Liquidity Impact**: The lock-in period until May 15, 2026 means these shares will not be available for trading in the secondary market for approximately 6 months from the listing date, limiting immediate supply.

**Capital Structure Impact**: The preferential allotment to non-promoters at Rs. 277/- per share will increase the public shareholding and may impact the promoter holding percentage. The shares ranking pari-passu ensures equal rights with existing shareholders.
