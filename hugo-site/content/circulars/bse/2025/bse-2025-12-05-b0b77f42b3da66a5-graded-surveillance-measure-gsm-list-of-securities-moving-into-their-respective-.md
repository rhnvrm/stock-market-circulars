## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework applies graded surveillance measures to securities based on specific criteria. Higher GSM stages involve:

- Additional surveillance deposit requirements
- Trade-for-trade settlement with no intraday leverage
- Price bands and other trading restrictions
- Increased reporting and compliance requirements

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with GSM stage-specific requirements for these securities
- Clients trading in these securities should be aware of applicable restrictions including trade-for-trade settlement
- Additional margin and surveillance deposit requirements apply
- No intraday trading or leverage available for these securities

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: December 5, 2025 (or as specified in the circular)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Securities moving to higher GSM stages face increased trading restrictions, reduced liquidity, and mandatory trade-for-trade settlement. This typically results in lower trading volumes and wider bid-ask spreads.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities will face stricter requirements including higher margin obligations and no intraday trading facility. This may reduce speculative interest.

**Market Signal:** Movement to higher GSM stages indicates potential concerns regarding price volatility, compliance issues, or other surveillance triggers, signaling investors to exercise increased caution.

**Framework Notes:** Securities marked with (#) move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM framework, while those marked ($) move lower if included in IBC framework. Some classifications reference NSE designations.
