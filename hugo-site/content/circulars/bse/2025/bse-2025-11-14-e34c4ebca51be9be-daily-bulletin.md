**Investor Impact**: Medium. Investors holding the mentioned securities need to be aware of these dates to ensure eligibility for dividends, interest payments, or rights issue participation. Missing record dates would result in loss of entitlements.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Standard processing for depositories, custodians, and brokers to credit entitlements based on record date holdings.
