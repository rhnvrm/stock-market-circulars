## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Inform all clients about commencement of RE trading and the specific ISIN (INE244B20022)
- Clarify to clients that REs should not be mistaken for ordinary shares
- Include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases stating:
  - Purchase of REs only gives right to participate in Rights Issue by applying with requisite money OR renounce before issue closes
  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced will lapse and be extinguished after Issue Closing Date
- Refer to notice no. 20200305-21 (March 05, 2020) and notice no. 20200518-34 (May 18, 2020) for further details

## Important Dates

- **December 12, 2025 (Friday)**: RE trading for renunciation begins; Rights Issue opens
- **December 16, 2025 (Tuesday)**: RE trading for renunciation ends
- **December 19, 2025**: Rights Issue closes; last date to subscribe or renounce REs
- **After December 19, 2025**: Unsubscribed/non-renounced REs will lapse and be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects existing shareholders of Patel Engineering Limited who hold Rights Entitlements and wish to either participate in the rights issue or trade their renunciation rights.

**Operational Impact:** Standard rights issue procedure requiring broker compliance with disclosure requirements. The short 5-day trading window for renunciation requires timely communication to clients. T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis ensures proper settlement but may limit liquidity.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders must act within the specified timeframe to either subscribe, renounce, or trade their rights entitlements. Failure to act will result in lapse of entitlements with no compensation after the issue closing date.
