**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to implement proper disclosure mechanisms in contract notes and ensure client awareness about the nature of REs versus ordinary shares.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders of Adani Enterprises Limited can monetize their rights entitlements if they choose not to subscribe to the rights issue, or can purchase additional entitlements from the market to increase their subscription.
