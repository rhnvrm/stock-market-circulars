## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Limited and routine. Commercial paper redemptions are scheduled maturity events that occur regularly in debt markets.

**Investor Impact:** Holders of these commercial papers will receive redemption proceeds as per their investment terms. No unexpected disruption for investors who were aware of maturity schedules.

**Trading Impact:** Temporary restriction affects only the specific commercial papers listed. Does not impact equity shares or other debt securities of these issuers. Market liquidity in these specific instruments will be nil during suspension, but this is expected for maturing instruments.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to update their systems to prevent inadvertent trades in suspended instruments. Standard operational procedure for such corporate actions.
