| 539770 | INE830S01014 | Darjeeling Ropeway Company Ltd |
| 543541 | INE0KHQ01010 | Sailani Tours N Travels Ltd |

## Securities Moving to Other Stages

- **Stage 0**: Venmax Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Ltd (531015, INE154G01022) - moved due to ESM Framework inclusion
- **Stage III**: Silveroak Commercials Ltd (512197, INE798C01017)

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the Graded Surveillance Measure framework which applies enhanced monitoring and trading restrictions to securities based on specific criteria. Movement across stages indicates changes in surveillance intensity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note the changed GSM stage classifications for affected securities
- Trading in these securities will be subject to the conditions applicable to their respective GSM stages
- Investors and brokers must comply with stage-specific trading restrictions and requirements

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: October 20, 2025
- Effective Date: As per GSM framework implementation schedule

## Impact Assessment

The movement of securities across GSM stages will impact trading conditions including potential restrictions on price bands, additional disclosures, and enhanced monitoring. Securities moving to higher GSM stages (like Stage III for Silveroak Commercials) face stricter surveillance measures. The inclusion of Venmax Drugs in ESM Framework represents a shift to enhanced surveillance outside the GSM framework. Investors should exercise caution when trading in securities under GSM surveillance.
