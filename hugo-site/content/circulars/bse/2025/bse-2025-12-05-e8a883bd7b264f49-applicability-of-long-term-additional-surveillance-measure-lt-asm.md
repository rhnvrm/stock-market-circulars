The circular identifies securities being newly added to LT-ASM, securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages, and securities being removed from the framework. Three securities are being newly shortlisted, one security is moving to a higher stage (Stage II), five securities are moving to lower stages, and 27 securities are being removed from the LT-ASM framework entirely.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities that have witnessed rapid price rise or abnormal price volatility. Securities in this framework are subject to stricter trading conditions including:

- Higher margin requirements
- Physical delivery obligations
- Price bands and circuit filters
- Additional disclosure requirements

Movement between stages (I through IV) indicates increasing or decreasing levels of surveillance based on trading patterns and market behavior.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable margin requirements for securities under LT-ASM
- Investors trading in these securities must fulfill physical delivery obligations
- Market participants should review their positions in affected securities
- Brokers must update their risk management systems to reflect new ASM classifications
- Enhanced disclosure and reporting requirements apply for trades in LT-ASM securities

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** December 05, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 08, 2025 - All changes to LT-ASM framework take effect from market opening

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - The surveillance measures will significantly affect trading in 36 securities, potentially reducing liquidity and increasing transaction costs for these stocks.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities will face stricter margin requirements and mandatory physical delivery, which may impact short-term trading strategies and require additional capital.

**Positive Developments:** 27 securities are being removed from LT-ASM, indicating improved market behavior and reduced volatility concerns, which should enhance liquidity and reduce trading costs for these stocks.

**Risk Mitigation:** The framework serves as a protective mechanism to alert investors about securities with unusual price movements and helps prevent excessive speculation.
