## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to NACL Industries shareholders and their trading decisions. Short three-day renunciation window requires prompt action from shareholders wishing to trade their rights.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure systems are configured for RE trading with proper ISIN, update client communications, and modify contract note templates to include required disclaimers.

**Investor Impact**: NACL Industries shareholders receive tradable rights that can be renounced during December 22-24, 2025. Investors must act before December 30, 2025 to either subscribe with application money or renounce their REs to avoid lapsing of entitlements.
