## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The listing of preferential allotment shares post warrant conversion is a standard capital-raising activity. The lock-in period of approximately 8 months ensures these shares will not be available for immediate sale in the market. The allotment to Non Promoters indicates expansion of the shareholding base. Given the relatively small number of shares and the lock-in restrictions, immediate trading impact is expected to be negligible.
