## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine SME IPO listing with standard lock-in provisions. The majority of shares (approximately 75.7 million shares) are subject to lock-in for 1-3 years, which will limit immediate trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: New investment opportunity in the SME segment. Lock-in periods ensure stability and commitment from promoters and early investors. Free float will be limited initially due to extensive lock-in provisions.
