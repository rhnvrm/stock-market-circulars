## Summary

BSE has approved the listing of 77,27,000 equity shares of Peninsula Land Limited (Scrip Code: 503031) issued to promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to conversion of Compulsory Convertible Debentures (CCDs). The shares will be available for trading from December 29, 2025, and rank pari-passu with existing equity shares.

## Key Points

- **Number of Shares**: 77,27,000 equity shares of Rs. 2/- each
- **Issue Price**: Rs. 44/- per share (Rs. 2/- face value + Rs. 42/- premium)
- **Allotment Date**: April 16, 2025
- **Trading Start Date**: December 29, 2025
- **ISIN**: INE138A01028
- **Distinctive Numbers**: 440883273 to 448610272
- **Issued To**: Promoters on preferential basis
- **Purpose**: Conversion of Compulsory Convertible Debentures (CCDs)
- **Ranking**: Pari-passu with existing equity shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following SEBI guidelines for preferential allotment and CCD conversion.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the listing of these new securities
- The shares are subject to lock-in requirements as specified
- All 77,27,000 shares must comply with the lock-in period ending August 30, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: April 16, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: December 29, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: August 30, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The shares are issued to promoters and subject to lock-in until August 30, 2026, meaning they cannot be traded freely until that date. This limits immediate market supply and price impact.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Trading members need to be aware of the new securities and their lock-in status. The shares rank equally with existing equity shares once the lock-in period expires.

**Shareholder Impact**: The preferential allotment to promoters increases their shareholding but does not immediately affect market liquidity due to the lock-in period.
