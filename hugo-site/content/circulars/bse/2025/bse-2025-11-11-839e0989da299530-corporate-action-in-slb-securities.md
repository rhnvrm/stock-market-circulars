## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects liquidity in SLB segment for 23 securities across sectors including shipping, energy, FMCG, auto, and real estate. However, cash market trading remains unaffected.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - SLB participants must adjust their lending/borrowing strategies and ensure positions are squared off or rolled over before shut periods. Automated trading systems need to account for these restrictions.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - primarily affects institutional investors and proprietary traders using SLB mechanisms. Retail investors holding these stocks in demat form for dividends are not directly impacted by SLB restrictions.

**Sectoral Distribution:** Diversified impact across multiple sectors including PSU (PFC, HUDCO, SCI, NALCO, MOIL), private sector (Sun TV, Info Edge, Ashok Leyland, Emami), and specialized industries (Petronet LNG, Great Eastern Shipping, Safari Industries).
