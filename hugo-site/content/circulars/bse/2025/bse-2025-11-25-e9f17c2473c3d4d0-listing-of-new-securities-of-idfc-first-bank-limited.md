## Summary

BSE has listed 43,71,85,666 new equity shares of IDFC FIRST BANK LIMITED (Scrip Code: 539437) with effect from November 26, 2025. These shares arise from the conversion of Compulsory Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS) issued to non-promoters on a preferential basis. The shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares and are subject to lock-in until August 18, 2026.

## Key Points

- **Number of Shares Listed**: 43,71,85,666 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each
- **Issue Price**: Rs. 60/- per share (Rs. 10 face value + Rs. 50 premium)
- **Date of Allotment**: October 27, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: November 26, 2025
- **ISIN**: INE092T01019
- **Distinctive Numbers**: 10798395032 to 11235580697
- **Nature**: Conversion from CCPS issued on preferential basis to non-promoters
- **Ranking**: Pari-passu with existing equity shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following SEBI preferential allotment regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the new securities for trading purposes
- All 43.72 crore shares are subject to mandatory lock-in requirements
- Shares cannot be transferred or sold before the lock-in expiry date

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment**: October 27, 2025
- **Listing Date**: November 26, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: August 18, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing represents a substantial increase in share capital through CCPS conversion. However, the immediate trading impact is limited as all shares are locked-in until August 2026. This prevents immediate selling pressure on the stock.

**Dilution Impact**: The preferential allotment to non-promoters at Rs. 60/- per share will result in equity dilution for existing shareholders. The pricing and lock-in terms suggest institutional or strategic investor participation.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased equity capital and floating stock for position limit calculations, though locked-in shares won't affect near-term liquidity.
