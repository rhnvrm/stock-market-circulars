- **To be announced**: OFS dates (separate notice to be issued)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Limited trading activity expected initially as trading is restricted to OFS mechanism for MPS compliance
- Significant dilution of existing shareholders' holdings due to preferential allotment of 95% shares to resolution applicant
- Only 5,00,000 shares (5% of total) available to public/DSK Shareholders Trust
- Trading liquidity will be constrained until normal trading commences post-MPS compliance

**Shareholder Impact:**
- Existing shareholders experienced major dilution through capital restructuring under IBC
- Pre-resolution shareholders now hold shares through DSK Shareholders Trust (5% only)
- Resolution applicant and affiliates control 95% of equity
- Lock-in details for shares to be announced post-MPS compliance

**Operational Impact:**
- Company emerged from insolvency proceedings with fresh capital infusion
- Corporate governance and management likely restructured under new ownership
- Trading resumption provides exit opportunity through OFS for certain shareholders
- Full trading normalization dependent on successful MPS compliance
