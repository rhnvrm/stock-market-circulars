## Impact Assessment

This is a routine short-term debt instrument listing with minimal market impact. The 9-day tenure commercial paper is a standard corporate treasury instrument used for short-term funding requirements. With top-tier credit ratings (A1+), these instruments provide institutional investors with a high-quality short-term investment option. The listing expands the debt market offerings on BSE but has no material impact on equity markets or broader trading operations.
