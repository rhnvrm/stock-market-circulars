The changes include increasing the minimum constituent count from 10 to 14 with preference for derivative stocks, implementing a new multi-tiered weight capping structure, and transitioning from quarterly to semi-annual rebalancing.

## Key Points

- 2% buffer for inclusion (88% coverage) and exclusion (92% coverage) retained
- Minimum 90% float-adjusted market capitalization coverage requirement continues
- Rebalancing frequency changed from quarterly to semi-annual

## Regulatory Changes

**Rebalancing Frequency:**

- New: Semi-annual rebalancing on Monday following third Friday of June and December

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Banking sector index composition will change with increased constituent count

**Operational Impact:**
