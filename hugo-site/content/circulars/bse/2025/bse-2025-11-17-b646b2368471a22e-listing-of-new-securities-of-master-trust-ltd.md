## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - The shares are issued to promoters on preferential basis with complete lock-in until May 29, 2027, meaning they cannot be traded in the market for approximately 18 months from the listing date. This minimizes immediate market supply impact.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - Routine listing process for warrant conversion. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new securities and lock-in restrictions.

**Shareholding Impact**: The preferential allotment to promoters will increase promoter holding in Master Trust Ltd., strengthening promoter stake in the company.
