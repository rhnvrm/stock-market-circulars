These shares were issued at a premium of Rs. 55.25 (total issue price Rs. 65.25) to non-promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to conversion of warrants. The allotment was completed on October 14, 2025, and all shares are subject to lock-in until June 29, 2026.

## Key Points

- Issue price: Rs. 65.25 per share (Rs. 10 face value + Rs. 55.25 premium)
- Issued to non-promoters through warrant conversion
- Distinguished Numbers: 56301869 to 57051868

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced by this circular. This is a standard listing notification following preferential allotment procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities available for trading
- Lock-in restrictions must be observed: all 750,000 shares locked until June 29, 2026
- Standard trading and settlement procedures apply for these securities

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: October 14, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: December 12, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: June 29, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a company-specific listing with modest share count (750,000 shares) that increases the floating stock of HB Estate Developers Ltd. The preferential allotment represents capital raising activity through warrant conversion.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - Trading members can trade these securities starting December 12, 2025, following standard procedures. The lock-in period until June 29, 2026 restricts immediate liquidity for these specific shares.

**Investor Impact**: The new shares are fungible with existing shares (pari-passu rights) but subject to approximately 6.5-month lock-in period. Issue price of Rs. 65.25 provides reference point for the warrant conversion terms.
