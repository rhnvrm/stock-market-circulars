The shares are subject to lock-in until May 20, 2026.

## Key Points

- 6,58,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each issued at premium of Rs. 7/- (total issue price: Rs. 17/-)
- Issued to non-promoters on preferential basis pursuant to warrant conversion
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares
- Two tranches: 4,00,000 shares allotted on July 24, 2025 and 2,58,000 shares on July 25, 2025
- ISIN: INE369C01017
- Trading commences November 10, 2025
- All shares subject to lock-in until May 20, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine listing notification following preferential allotment procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members should:
- Update their systems to reflect the new securities available for trading
- Note the lock-in restrictions on all 6,58,000 shares until May 20, 2026
- Ensure the shares are identified with the correct ISIN (INE369C01017)

## Important Dates

- **July 24, 2025**: Allotment date for 4,00,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 13336101 to 13736100)

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact expected. This is a relatively small preferential allotment representing additional equity shares for Norben Tea & Exports Ltd. The lock-in period until May 20, 2026 means these shares cannot be traded freely until then, limiting immediate liquidity impact. The issuance represents capital raising through warrant conversion at Rs. 17/- per share to non-promoter investors.
