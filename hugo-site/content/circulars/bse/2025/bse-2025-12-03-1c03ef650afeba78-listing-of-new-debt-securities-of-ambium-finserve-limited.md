## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to a routine listing of privately placed debt securities by a single company. The impact is primarily limited to:

- **Debt Market Participants**: Trading members and investors interested in debt securities rated BBB- with monthly income streams
- **Company-Specific**: Provides AMBIUM FINSERVE LIMITED access to debt capital markets for its financing needs
- **Liquidity**: Adds one new debt instrument to BSE's debt segment with relatively small issue size (Rs. 20 crore)
- **Risk Profile**: The CARE BBB- rating indicates moderate credit quality with adequate safety for timely payment, but also carries moderate credit risk
- **Income Investors**: May attract investors seeking monthly fixed income at 11.16% p.a. over a 32-month tenure

No immediate action is required by general market participants unless specifically interested in trading or investing in this particular debt security.
