## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The issuance represents routine ESOP/ESOS conversions with relatively small share quantities compared to the existing float of these companies. The absence of lock-in periods means shares are immediately tradable.

**Dilution Impact**: Low. The aggregate shares being listed represent minor dilution for shareholders. Even the largest single issuance (Fedbank - 348,312 shares) is unlikely to materially impact stock prices.

**Liquidity Impact**: Neutral to slightly positive. Additional shares in circulation may marginally improve liquidity for these securities.
