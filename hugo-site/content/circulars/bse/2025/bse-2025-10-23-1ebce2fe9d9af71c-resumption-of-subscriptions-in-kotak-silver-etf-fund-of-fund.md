## Summary

Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company Limited has announced the resumption of subscriptions in Kotak Silver ETF Fund of Fund effective October 23, 2025. The fund is reopening for fresh/additional lumpsum and switch-in transactions following the normalization of market conditions and reduction in premium, as referenced in an earlier addendum dated October 09, 2025.

## Key Points

- Subscriptions in Kotak Silver ETF Fund of Fund were previously suspended via addendum dated October 09, 2025
- Market conditions have normalized and premium has reduced, prompting the resumption
- All fresh/additional lumpsum transactions are now accepted
- All switch-in transactions are now accepted
- All other terms and conditions of the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) remain unchanged
- This addendum forms an integral part of the SID and KIM

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational update to the scheme's subscription status.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. Investors can resume normal investment activities in the scheme following standard procedures outlined in the SID and KIM.

## Important Dates

- **October 09, 2025**: Date of earlier addendum (suspending subscriptions)
- **October 20, 2025**: Date of current notice
- **October 23, 2025**: Effective date for resumption of subscriptions

## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it pertains only to investors in the Kotak Silver ETF Fund of Fund. The resumption of subscriptions indicates that the AMC believes market conditions for silver investments have stabilized. Investors who were waiting to invest in this scheme can now proceed with their transactions. The earlier suspension was likely implemented to protect investors during periods of high premium or volatile market conditions in the silver segment.
