title: Revision of Client Categories in Unique Client Code Database - NRE and NRO
  Classification
---

## Summary

BSE is revising the client category structure in the Unique Client Code (UCC) database to facilitate better identification of non-resident clients. The existing "NRI" client category will be renamed to "NRE" (Non-Resident External), and a new "NRO" (Non-Resident Ordinary) category will be introduced. Trading members must update their client records accordingly before the implementation date of November 22, 2025.

## Key Points

- Existing "NRI" client category in UCC database will be renamed to "NRE" (Non-Resident External)
- New client category "NRO" (Non-Resident Ordinary) will be introduced
- Changes aim to facilitate ease of identification of NRE and NRO clients
- Trading members must update all client records in the UCC database
- Changes will be available on UCC module from November 22, 2025
- No changes required for UCCs already created for NRE accounts

## Regulatory Changes

**Revised UCC Client Classification Structure:**

| Client Type | Client Status | Client Category | Category Description | Remarks |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------|
| INDIVIDUAL (I) | CLIENT | NRE | Non-Resident External | Existing NRI clients will now be classified as NRE |
| INDIVIDUAL (I) | CLIENT | NRO | Non-Resident Ordinary | New category will be introduced for NRO account holders |

Trading members can undertake requisite changes in existing client categories to align with the new classification structure.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members** must ensure all client records are updated in the UCC database according to the new classification
- Review existing NRI client accounts and classify them appropriately as NRE or NRO
- Update systems to accommodate the new NRO category
- Complete necessary updates before the implementation date
- Ensure proper documentation distinguishing between NRE and NRO account holders

- Poonam Pisat, Assistant Vice President, Investigation

## Important Dates

- **October 30, 2025**: Circular issued (Notice No. 20251030-57)
- **November 22, 2025**: Implementation date - revised classification becomes effective and available on UCC module

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading members will need to review and update their client databases to reflect the new categorization. System changes may be required to handle the new NRO category.

**Compliance Impact:** This change improves regulatory compliance by providing clearer distinction between NRE and NRO clients, which have different regulatory treatments under FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) regulations.

**Client Impact:** Minimal direct impact on clients, as this is primarily an administrative reclassification. However, proper categorization ensures clients receive appropriate treatment based on their account type.

**Timeline Impact:** Trading members have approximately three weeks from the circular date to complete necessary system and database updates before the November 22, 2025 implementation.
