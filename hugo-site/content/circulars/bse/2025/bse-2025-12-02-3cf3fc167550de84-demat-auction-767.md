## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 98 securities across various sectors. While routine in nature, the auction indicates delivery failures in the settlement cycle.

**Investor Impact:** Sellers who failed to deliver will face auction losses if auction prices are higher than settlement prices. Buyers awaiting delivery will receive their shares through this mechanism.

**Operational Impact:** Standard auction process for clearing members and brokers. Notable high-volume failures in Mehai Techno, Padam Cotton, and Starlineps may indicate specific issues with these scrips.

**Liquidity Impact:** Temporary impact on the affected securities during the auction process. Large quantities like Mehai Techno (49,997 shares) may see price volatility during auction.
