## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it pertains to the operational reopening of a single mutual fund scheme. The impact is limited to:

- **Investors**: Those interested in Union Consumption Fund can now resume subscriptions, redemptions, and systematic transactions
- **Distribution Network**: BSE StAR MF Platform members can facilitate transactions in this fund
- **Market Operations**: Routine enhancement of available investment products on the platform

The reopening suggests the fund has resolved any previous issues that led to suspension of new transactions, allowing normal operations to resume.
