## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited market impact as this affects a specific series of privately placed debentures of Samunnati Finance Private Limited. The suspension is temporary and related to a routine corporate action.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders on record as of December 21, 2025 will be entitled to receive redemption proceeds and final interest payment. The two-day suspension period (December 19-21) ensures proper settlement and determination of eligible investors.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trades in the affected ISIN. The short suspension period minimizes operational disruption. This is a standard procedure for debt securities approaching redemption with a fixed record date.
