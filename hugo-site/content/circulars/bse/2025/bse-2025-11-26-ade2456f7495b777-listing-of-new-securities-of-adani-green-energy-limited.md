## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - While the listing adds significant share capital (24.58 million shares), the immediate trading impact is limited as all shares are locked-in until May 29, 2027. The shares will not be available for trading until lock-in expiry.

**Dilution Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the equity dilution from this preferential allotment. The exact dilution percentage depends on the pre-issue share capital.

**Promoter Holding**: This preferential allotment to promoters pursuant to warrant conversion indicates promoter confidence and capital infusion. Promoter holding will increase, subject to disclosure in shareholding patterns.

**Capital Raising**: The approximately Rs. 3,640 crore capital raise strengthens Adani Green Energy's balance sheet for renewable energy project expansion and debt reduction.

**Long-term Impact**: Post lock-in expiry in May 2027, the additional float may impact liquidity and price dynamics depending on promoter selling intentions.
