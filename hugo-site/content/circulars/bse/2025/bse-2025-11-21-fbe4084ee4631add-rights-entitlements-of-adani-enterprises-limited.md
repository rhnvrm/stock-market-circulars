- **December 10, 2025**: Rights Issue closes; unsubscribed/unrenounced REs lapse and are extinguished

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects trading activity for shareholders of Adani Enterprises Limited who hold rights entitlements and wish to either participate in the rights issue or trade their entitlements.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - trading members need to ensure proper client communication regarding the nature of REs, include mandatory disclaimers in contract notes, and handle T+1 settlement on trade-for-trade basis for dematerialized REs only.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders must decide whether to subscribe to the rights issue with requisite payment, renounce their rights through trading during the specified period, or allow them to lapse. The relatively short trading window (9 trading days) requires timely decision-making.
