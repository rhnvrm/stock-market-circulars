## Summary

BSE has announced the listing of 174,622 bonus equity shares of ICICI Bank Limited that were previously kept in abeyance. The circular, dated November 10, 2025, provides an annexure containing share certificate number ranges for these bonus shares. All shares have no lock-in period applicable.

## Key Points

- Total shares being listed: 174,622 bonus equity shares
- Company: ICICI Bank Limited
- Share certificate ranges: From 6412497357 to 6412500373 (73 different ranges)
- Lock-in period: Not Applicable for all ranges
- Date of annexure: November 10, 2025
- These shares were previously kept in abeyance from a bonus issue

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification for bonus shares that were previously held in abeyance.

## Compliance Requirements

- ICICI Bank Limited must comply with standard listing requirements for these bonus shares
- No additional compliance requirements mentioned as no lock-in period applies
- Shares are now available for trading without restrictions

## Important Dates

- Annexure date: November 10, 2025
- Circular publication date: November 12, 2025
- No specific effective date mentioned for trading commencement

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. The 174,622 shares represent a very small fraction of ICICI Bank's total equity capital. These shares were already part of the bonus issue and kept in abeyance for administrative or regulatory reasons. The release from abeyance is a procedural matter and should not affect stock price or trading activity significantly. No lock-in restrictions allow immediate trading availability for eligible shareholders.
