## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of TRUHOME FINANCE LIMITED (ISIN: INE432R07422, Code: 975927) effective December 11, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from December 11, 2025 onwards.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies to TRUHOME FINANCE LIMITED's 8.94% debentures maturing on December 26, 2025
- ISIN: INE432R07422, BSE Code: 975927
- Record date set for December 11, 2025
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- No dealings permitted from December 11, 2025
- Notice number: DR-775/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard operational suspension pursuant to established procedures for debt securities approaching redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from December 11, 2025
- Brokers and market participants must inform their clients holding these debentures about the trading suspension
- All pending orders for these debentures should be cancelled effective from the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **December 9, 2025**: Notice issued by BSE
- **December 11, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment; Trading suspension effective from this date
- **December 26, 2025**: Debenture maturity date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine administrative action affecting a single private placement NCD issue. Holders of these debentures will not be able to trade them on the exchange from the suspension date, but this is expected as the securities are approaching maturity.

**Investor Impact**: Low. Investors holding these debentures will receive their redemption proceeds and final interest payment as per the terms. The trading suspension is a standard procedure to freeze ownership as of the record date.

**Operational Impact**: Negligible. Trading members are accustomed to such suspensions which are routine in the debt market ahead of redemption events.
