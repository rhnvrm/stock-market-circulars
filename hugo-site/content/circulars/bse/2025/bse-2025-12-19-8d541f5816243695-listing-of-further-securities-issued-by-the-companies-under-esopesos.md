## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for ESOP/ESOS-issued shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital for these companies
- Trading members should ensure that the new shares are available for trading from December 22, 2025
- The companies have fulfilled all listing requirements under ESOP/ESOS regulations

- **Notice Date**: December 19, 2025
- **Listing and Trading Commencement**: December 22, 2025 (Monday)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The share dilution is relatively minor for all listed companies. The largest issuance is 1.1 million shares by Yes Bank, which represents a small fraction of their outstanding shares.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in tradable float. Absence of lock-in restrictions means shares are immediately available for trading.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders may experience marginal dilution in ownership percentage, but the impact is minimal given the small quantum of shares relative to total outstanding shares for these large-cap and mid-cap companies.

**Sector Distribution**: Diverse sector representation including banking (Axis Bank, Yes Bank), NBFC (Fedbank Financial), technology (Wipro, Tech Mahindra), e-commerce (Nykaa), insurance (HDFC Life), and regtech (IRIS).
