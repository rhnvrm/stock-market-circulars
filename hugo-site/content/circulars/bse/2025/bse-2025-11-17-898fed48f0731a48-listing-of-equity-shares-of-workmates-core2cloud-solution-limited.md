## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - New listing adds liquidity to the market segment, though substantial portion of shares under lock-in restricts immediate free float.

**Investor Impact**: Staggered lock-in expiry dates (2026-2028) will gradually increase tradable float, potentially affecting stock price discovery as larger tranches become available for trading. Investors should note the concentration of lock-in releases, particularly the large tranche expiring in 2026.

**Operational Impact**: Standard listing process with no immediate operational changes required for market participants.
