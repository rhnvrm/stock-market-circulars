title: Suspension of Trading in Piramal Finance Limited Debt Securities Due to Coupon
  Rate Restructuring
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in two debt securities of Piramal Finance Limited effective December 02, 2025, due to restructuring of coupon rates. This is a continuation of earlier notice 20250225-30 dated February 25, 2025. The restructuring involves upward revision of coupon rates for both affected securities.

## Key Points

- Two scrip codes (958463 and 958647) will be suspended from trading
- Trading suspension effective from Tuesday, December 02, 2025
- Coupon rates revised upward for both securities
- ISIN INE516Y07014: Coupon revised from 9.27% p.a.p.m. to 9.52% p.a.p.m.
- ISIN INE516Y07063: Coupon revised from 9.5109% p.a. to 9.7609% p.a.
- This follows earlier notice dated February 25, 2025 regarding the same issuer

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This is a company-specific restructuring action requiring trading suspension as per existing debt market regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the suspension of the two scrip codes from December 02, 2025
- No trading shall be permitted in the affected securities from the effective date
- Trading members requiring clarification should contact BSE Debt Listing officials

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 28, 2025
- **Trading Suspension Effective Date**: December 02, 2025
- **Related Previous Notice**: February 25, 2025 (Notice 20250225-30)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders and traders of the two specific debt securities. The trading suspension will prevent secondary market transactions until restructuring is completed and securities are relisted with revised terms.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for existing holders as coupon rates are being revised upward (increases of 25 basis points and 25 basis points respectively), providing higher returns. However, liquidity will be temporarily affected during the suspension period.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to reflect the suspension and ensure no trades are executed in these securities from December 02, 2025.
