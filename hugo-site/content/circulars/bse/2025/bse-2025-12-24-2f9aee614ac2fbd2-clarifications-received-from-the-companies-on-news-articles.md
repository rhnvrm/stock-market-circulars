## Summary

Castrol India Limited has informed BSE and NSE pursuant to Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, about a press release issued by its ultimate holding company BP p.l.c. on December 24, 2025. BP has reached an agreement to sell a 65% shareholding in Castrol to Stonepeak at an enterprise value of $10 billion. The transaction will result in the formation of a new joint venture with 65% Stonepeak and 35% BP ownership, with BP retaining optionality to sell its remaining 35% stake after a two-year lock-up period. The transaction is expected to complete by end of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.

## Key Points

- BP p.l.c. (ultimate holding company of Castrol India Limited) has agreed to sell 65% shareholding in Castrol to Stonepeak
- Enterprise value of the transaction is $10 billion (implied EV/LTM EBITDA of around 8.6x)
- Implied total equity value of Castrol is $8.0 billion after deducting JV minority interests totaling $1.8 billion and other debt-like obligations of around $0.3 billion
- Total net proceeds to BP approximately $6.0 billion, including around $0.8 billion for pre-payment of future dividend income on BP's retained 35% stake
- BP will fully utilize proceeds to reduce net debt
- A new joint venture will be incorporated with 65% Stonepeak and 35% BP ownership
- Castrol has demonstrated nine consecutive quarters of year-on-year earnings growth
- A significant proportion of Castrol JV minority interests relate to the shareholding in publicly listed Castrol India Limited
- BP will have a two-year lock-up period on its retained 35% stake, after which it has optionality to sell
- Transaction accelerates delivery of BP's reset strategy to simplify portfolio, strengthen balance sheet, and focus downstream on leading integrated businesses

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a disclosure made under Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, regarding material events at the ultimate holding company level.

## Compliance Requirements

- Castrol India Limited has complied with Regulation 30 disclosure requirements by informing stock exchanges about the press release from ultimate holding company
- Transaction will require regulatory approvals before completion
- Given that Castrol India Limited is publicly listed and forms a significant proportion of Castrol JV minority interests, further disclosures and approvals may be required as the transaction progresses

## Important Dates

- **December 24, 2025**: Press release date and disclosure to stock exchanges
- **End of 2026**: Expected transaction completion date (subject to regulatory approvals)
- **Two years post-completion**: End of lock-up period for BP's retained 35% stake

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Castrol India Limited and stakeholders:**

- **Ownership Structure**: The transaction will fundamentally alter the ownership structure of the Castrol group, with Stonepeak becoming the majority 65% owner and BP retaining 35%
- **Listed Entity Implications**: As Castrol India Limited represents a significant proportion of Castrol JV minority interests and is publicly listed on BSE (scrip code 500870) and NSE (symbol CASTROLIND), shareholders need to monitor developments closely
- **Strategic Direction**: The new joint venture structure may lead to changes in strategic direction, management approach, and business priorities
- **Future Uncertainty**: BP's optionality to sell its remaining 35% stake after two years creates potential for further ownership changes
- **Valuation Signal**: The enterprise value of $10 billion and 8.6x EV/LTM EBITDA multiple provides a valuation benchmark for the Castrol business
- **Growth Trajectory**: The transaction is based on Castrol's strong performance (nine consecutive quarters of earnings growth), which may influence market perception
- **Regulatory Process**: The transaction timeline extending to end of 2026 indicates a complex regulatory approval process that may involve multiple jurisdictions and authorities
- **Dividend Policy**: Pre-payment of $0.8 billion in future dividends to BP may impact dividend flow to minority shareholders in the near to medium term

**Market participants should monitor subsequent disclosures regarding regulatory approvals, shareholder approvals, and any changes to management or business strategy of Castrol India Limited.**
