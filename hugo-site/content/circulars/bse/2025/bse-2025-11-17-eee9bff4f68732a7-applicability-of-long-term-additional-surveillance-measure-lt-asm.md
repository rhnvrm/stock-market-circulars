## Summary

BSE has updated the list of securities under the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective November 18, 2025. Six securities are newly shortlisted in LT-ASM, two securities are moved directly to Stage IV ASM, and one security (Hemo Organic Ltd) is being removed from the framework due to inclusion in GSM Framework. No securities are being moved between ASM stages at this time.

## Key Points

- 6 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Containe Technologies Ltd, Khandelwal Extractions Ltd, Rapicut Carbides Ltd, Trustwave Securities Ltd, Tuni Textile Mills Ltd, and Vivanza Biosciences Ltd
- 2 securities moved directly to Stage IV LT-ASM: Blue Pearl Agriventures Ltd and Midwest Gold Ltd
- 1 security (Hemo Organic Ltd) moving out of LT-ASM Framework due to inclusion in GSM Framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages within the LT-ASM framework
- Changes effective from November 18, 2025
- Consolidated list includes securities across ASM Stages I through IV

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure is a framework designed to alert investors about securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or other concerning characteristics. Securities under LT-ASM are subject to enhanced surveillance and may have specific trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note the revised ASM classification for affected securities
- Enhanced due diligence required when trading in LT-ASM securities
- Investors should be aware of the higher risk profile associated with securities in this framework
- Trading members must ensure compliance with surveillance framework requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 18, 2025 - All changes to LT-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The inclusion of securities in LT-ASM framework typically results in reduced liquidity and increased price discovery challenges. The six newly listed securities will face enhanced surveillance which may deter speculative trading.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should exercise increased caution. Securities in higher ASM stages (particularly Stage IV) face stricter trading conditions.

**Operational Impact**: The removal of Hemo Organic Ltd from LT-ASM due to GSM inclusion indicates the security faces more severe surveillance measures, significantly impacting its tradability.
