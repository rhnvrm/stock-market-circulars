The shares will be available for trading with effect from Tuesday, December 16, 2025. The shares carry differential lock-in periods with 17.03 lakh shares locked until June 30, 2027 and 68.12 lakh shares locked until June 30, 2026.

- Issue price: Rs. 30 per share
- Allotment date: August 21, 2025
- Trading commencement: December 16, 2025

- Shares issued pursuant to conversion of warrants
- Distinctive numbers: 55438501 to 63953500
- ISIN: INE147C01017
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following completion of preferential allotment process and warrant conversion.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are informed of the new securities and must ensure:
- Recognition of the new distinctive number range (55438501 to 63953500)
- Application of appropriate lock-in restrictions on designated share quantities
- Treatment of shares as pari-passu with existing equity shares for all corporate actions

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: August 21, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: December 16, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry (68.12 lakh shares)**: June 30, 2026 (Dist. Nos. 57141501 - 63953500)
- **Lock-in Expiry (17.03 lakh shares)**: June 30, 2027 (Dist. Nos. 55438501 - 57141500)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This represents a routine listing of preferentially allotted shares following warrant conversion. The staggered lock-in periods (80% until June 2026 and 20% until June 2027) will prevent immediate selling pressure.

**Liquidity Impact**: Low immediate impact due to lock-in restrictions. Only after June 30, 2026 will 68.12 lakh shares become tradeable, potentially increasing float.

**Shareholder Impact**: Affects promoter and non-promoter allottees who converted warrants. The new shares carry full voting and dividend rights being pari-passu with existing equity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update systems to recognize new distinctive numbers and enforce lock-in restrictions on specified share quantities.
