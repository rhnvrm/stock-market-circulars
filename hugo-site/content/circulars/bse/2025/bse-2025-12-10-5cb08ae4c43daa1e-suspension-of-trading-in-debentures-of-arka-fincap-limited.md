## Summary

BSE has issued a circular suspending trading in two series of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of ARKA FINCAP LIMITED effective December 12, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these specific debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Two series of NCDs of ARKA FINCAP LIMITED will be suspended from trading
- First security: AFL-9%-27-12-25-NCD (ISIN: INE03W107264, Code: 939142)
- Second security: AFL-9.3%-27-12-25-NCD (ISIN: INE03W107215, Code: 939144)
- Record date for both securities: December 12, 2025
- No dealings permitted from December 12, 2025
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Reference: DR-776/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action notice for suspension of trading in debt securities due to record date fixation.

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The suspension affects only two specific NCD series of ARKA FINCAP LIMITED in the debt market segment. Debenture holders cannot trade these securities from December 12, 2025.

**Investor Impact**: Holders of these NCDs will receive interest payment and principal redemption as per the record date. However, they lose liquidity for these securities from the suspension date until redemption.
