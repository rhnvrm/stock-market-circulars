Existing SIP/STP registrations will continue to be processed.

Updates will be incorporated into the Statement of Additional Information (SAI), Scheme Information Document (SID), and Key Information Memorandum (KIM).

## Compliance Requirements

- Applications for fresh subscriptions/switch-ins received post cutoff timing on October 7, 2025 for the three international equity schemes will not be processed
- No fresh SIP/STP registrations will be accepted for suspended schemes
- No units will be allotted under SIP/STP falling on or after October 7, 2025 for suspended schemes
- Distributors and platforms must update their systems to reflect new minimum amounts
- Investors must be informed through updated SAI, SID, and KIM documents

## Important Dates

- **October 6, 2025**: Addendum notice date
- **October 7, 2025**: Effective date for suspension of fresh subscriptions in three international equity schemes
- **October 8, 2025**: Effective date for Daily SIP minimum amount changes and Liquid Fund minimum application amount reduction

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts:**
- Lower entry barriers (Rs. 10 Daily SIP, Rs. 100 Liquid Fund minimum) make investing more accessible to retail investors
- Enhanced financial inclusion through micro-investment opportunities
- Existing SIP/STP investors in suspended schemes remain unaffected

**Negative Impacts:**
- New investors cannot enter three international equity schemes, limiting portfolio diversification options
- Switch-in facility blocked for suspended schemes, restricting rebalancing strategies
- Suspension suggests possible capacity constraints or strategic repositioning in international equity offerings

**Market Implications:**
- Reflects potential AUM management or performance considerations in international equity schemes
- May indicate fund house's strategic focus shift away from international equity products
- Investors seeking international exposure must look at alternative fund houses or schemes
