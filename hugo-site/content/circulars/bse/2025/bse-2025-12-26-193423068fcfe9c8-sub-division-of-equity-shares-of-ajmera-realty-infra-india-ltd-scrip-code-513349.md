## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced by this circular. This is a standard corporate action notification as per SEBI and BSE guidelines for stock sub-divisions.

## Compliance Requirements

### For Trading Members:
- Be aware that the existing ISIN No. INE298G01027 (Rs.10/- paid-up) will not be valid for transactions on or after January 15, 2026
- Wait for separate notice from BSE regarding the new ISIN number for Rs.2/- paid-up shares
- Update trading systems and client communications accordingly

### For Investors:
- No action required from shareholders
- Shares held in demat form will be automatically credited in the new sub-divided ratio
- Existing holdings will be adjusted post-record date

## Important Dates

- **December 26, 2025**: Announcement date of the sub-division
- **January 15, 2026**: Record date for determining eligible shareholders
- **January 15, 2026**: Effective date for sub-divided shares; old ISIN becomes invalid
- **To be announced**: New ISIN number for Rs.2/- face value shares

## Impact Assessment

### Market Impact:
- **Liquidity**: Sub-division typically improves stock liquidity by making shares more affordable to retail investors
- **Price Adjustment**: Stock price will adjust proportionately (divide by 5) on the effective date
- **Trading Volume**: May see increased trading activity due to lower price per share

### Operational Impact:
- **ISIN Change**: Critical for trading systems - old ISIN INE298G01027 will be invalidated from January 15, 2026
- **Demat Accounts**: Automatic credit of additional shares to demat accounts post-record date
- **Market Lot**: May result in changes to market lot size for trading

### Investor Impact:
- Shareholding percentage remains unchanged
- Total investment value remains the same
- Improved affordability for small investors
- Potential for increased retail participation

This is a routine corporate action with medium impact, primarily affecting trading mechanics and share affordability rather than fundamental company value.
