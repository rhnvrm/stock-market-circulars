## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 92 scrips but quantities are relatively small for most securities except GV FILMS (489,533 shares). Large-cap stocks like Infosys, Bharti Airtel, and IOC have minimal quantities indicating smooth settlement processes.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading members with delivery shortages in these scrips must participate in the auction to fulfill settlement obligations. Failure to do so may result in penalties.

**Price Impact:** Low to Medium - Demat auctions can cause temporary price volatility in affected scrips, particularly for smaller companies with lower liquidity. The high quantity in GV FILMS may see more significant impact.
