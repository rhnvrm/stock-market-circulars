title: KYC Validation Requirements - Trading Restrictions for Non-Compliant Clients
  from December 20, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has issued guidelines following SEBI amendments to KYC Registration Agency (KRA) Regulations, 2011. Clients whose KYCs uploaded to KRAs between November 1-30, 2025 remain "On Hold" (non-validated) will face trading restrictions from December 20, 2025. Trading members must implement centralized demise reporting mechanisms and block transactions for deceased investors. Non-compliant PANs will be flagged by the Exchange, preventing new trades and position squaring until KYC validation is completed.

## Key Points

- Clients with non-validated KYC (uploaded Nov 1-30, 2025) will be barred from trading effective December 20, 2025
- Applies to both Aadhaar and non-Aadhaar based OVD KYCs marked "On Hold" by KRAs
- Non-compliant clients cannot square up existing open positions; positions will expire naturally on contract expiry dates
- KRA shares demise data daily; trading members must block debit transactions and suspend trading accounts for deceased investors
- Once KYC becomes compliant, trading will resume on T+1 basis based on KRA information received on T Day
- Non-compliant client list available at: \EQ\Transaction\December-2025\10-12-2025\Non_Validated_Clients_by_KRAs_Clgno_xxxx.TXT

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements:

1. **SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/FATF/P/CIR/2023/0144 (August 11, 2023)**: Simplification of KYC process and rationalization of Risk Management Framework at KRAs

2. **SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/OIAE/OIAE_IAD-1/P/CIR/2023/0000000163 (October 3, 2023)**: Centralized mechanism for reporting investor demise through KRAs

3. **Previous BSE Notice 20251111-43 (November 11, 2025)**: Monthly guidelines on KYC compliance requirements

Amendments strengthen KYC validation processes and establish systematic mechanisms for handling non-compliant accounts and deceased investor records across all SEBI-regulated entities.

## Compliance Requirements

### For Trading Members:

1. **Non-Validated KYC Clients**:
   - Monitor daily non-compliant client lists provided by BSE
   - Ensure clients complete KYC validation requirements before December 20, 2025 deadline
   - Inform affected clients about trading restrictions
   - Track KRA compliance status updates

2. **Deceased Investor Accounts**:
   - Process daily demise data shared by KRAs
   - Block all debit transactions in deceased investor accounts
   - Suspend all transactions in trading accounts
   - Inactivate/close UCC (Unique Client Code) across all stock exchanges

3. **Monitoring and Reporting**:
   - Download daily non-compliant client files from specified path
   - Verify client KYC status with KRAs
   - Update systems to reflect trading permissions on T+1 for newly compliant PANs

### For Clients:

- Complete KYC validation with KRAs immediately if KYC is "On Hold"
- Provide all required documentation to remove "On Hold" status
- Ensure compliance before December 20, 2025 to avoid trading suspension

## Important Dates

- **November 1-30, 2025**: Period during which non-validated KYCs uploaded to KRA are subject to December restrictions
- **December 10, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **December 20, 2025**: Effective date for trading restrictions on non-compliant clients
- **T+1**: Trading resumption for clients who become KRA-compliant (T = day KRA compliance information received by Exchange)
- **Daily**: KRA shares demise data and non-compliant client lists

## Impact Assessment

### Operational Impact:

- **High**: Trading members must implement robust systems to track daily KRA compliance updates and deceased investor data
- Members need to modify surveillance and risk management systems to flag non-compliant PANs
- Increased client communication requirements to ensure timely KYC validation
- Resource allocation needed for processing non-compliant client lists and account blocking procedures

### Market Impact:

- **Medium to High**: Potential reduction in trading volumes if significant number of clients have non-validated KYCs
- Clients with open positions and non-compliant KYC face forced expiry of positions (cannot square up)
- Market liquidity may be affected if large participant base falls under restrictions

### Client Impact:

- **High**: Clients with "On Hold" KYC status face complete trading suspension including inability to close existing positions
- Financial exposure risk for clients unable to manage open positions during restriction period
- Operational burden on clients to complete validation procedures urgently

### Compliance Impact:

- Strengthens regulatory framework for investor protection and FATF compliance
- Improves data integrity across KRAs and stock exchanges
- Enhances systematic handling of deceased investor accounts preventing unauthorized transactions
