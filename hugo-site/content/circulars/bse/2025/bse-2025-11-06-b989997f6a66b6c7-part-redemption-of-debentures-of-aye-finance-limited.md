## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - This part redemption affects holders of AYE Finance Limited's 10.50% Non-Convertible Debentures maturing on August 28, 2026. The reduction in face value to Rs. 37,500 per debenture indicates a partial return of principal to debenture holders.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and investors holding these debentures need to account for the reduced face value in their portfolios and trading systems from November 13, 2025 onwards. Future interest calculations and the final redemption amount will be based on the reduced face value.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders on record as of November 13, 2025 will receive both the part redemption proceeds and interest payment, resulting in partial liquidity while continuing to hold debentures with reduced principal exposure.
