## Summary

BSE has updated the list of securities under the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework. Seven securities are being added to the ST-ASM framework while four securities are moving out, effective August 13, 2025. The circular provides consolidated lists showing current ST-ASM status and stage classifications.

## Key Points

- 7 securities newly shortlisted for ST-ASM framework including SME and T+0 scrips
- 4 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages
- Consolidated list shows 15+ securities currently under ST-ASM with Stage I classification
- Framework includes 5/15/30 days surveillance periods

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of updated ST-ASM framework with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Securities moving out are transitioning to other surveillance frameworks including GSM Framework for enhanced monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with ST-ASM trading restrictions for listed securities
- Enhanced surveillance measures apply to all transactions in shortlisted securities
- Monitoring of price movements and trading volumes for ASM securities

## Important Dates

- **August 13, 2025**: Effective date for new ST-ASM classifications
- Changes to surveillance measures become applicable from market opening

## Impact Assessment

Trading in affected securities will be subject to additional surveillance measures including enhanced monitoring of price movements and trading patterns. Securities moving out of ST-ASM may see normalized trading conditions, while newly included securities will face stricter oversight. The measure aims to curb excessive speculation and maintain market integrity.
