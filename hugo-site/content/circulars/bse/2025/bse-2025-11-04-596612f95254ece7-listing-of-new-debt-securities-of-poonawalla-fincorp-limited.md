The securities provide institutional investors with AAA-rated fixed income investment options from Poonawalla Fincorp Limited with tenures of approximately 5 and 5.5 years. The high credit ratings (CARE AAA/Stable and CRISIL AAA/Stable) indicate low credit risk. The listing expands the debt securities trading universe on BSE but does not affect equity markets or broader market operations.
