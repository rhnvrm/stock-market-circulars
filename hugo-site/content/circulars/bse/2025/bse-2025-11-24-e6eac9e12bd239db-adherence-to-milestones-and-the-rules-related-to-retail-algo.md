title: Extension of Timeline for Implementation of Retail Algorithmic Trading Framework
  - Glide Path and Milestones
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued a circular extending the timeline for implementation of the retail algorithmic trading framework originally scheduled for August 1, 2025, then extended to October 1, 2025. Due to representations from stock brokers and algo vendors regarding system changes needed after clarifications issued in September 2025, SEBI now provides a glide path with three key milestones between October 2025 and January 2026. Stock brokers failing to meet these milestones will be barred from onboarding new retail clients for API-based algo trading from January 5, 2026. Full implementation is mandated by April 1, 2026.

## Key Points

- Original circular on safer retail algo trading participation issued February 4, 2025
- Initial implementation deadline of August 1, 2025 was extended to October 1, 2025
- Exchanges issued detailed operational modalities on July 22, 2025 with clarifications in September 2025
- Stock brokers ready with systems can go live from October 1, 2025
- Three mandatory milestones established for brokers requiring more time
- Failure to meet milestones results in prohibition on new retail client onboarding for API algo trading from January 5, 2026
- Full framework applicable to all stock brokers from April 1, 2026
- Stock exchanges responsible for monitoring broker compliance with milestones

## Regulatory Changes

The circular modifies the implementation timeline for SEBI's February 4, 2025 circular on "Safer participation of retail investors in Algorithmic trading". Key regulatory changes include:

1. **Phased Implementation Approach**: Instead of a single go-live date, brokers can implement in phases while meeting specific milestones

2. **Milestone-Based Compliance**: Introduction of three mandatory milestones with specific deadlines

3. **Penalty Framework**: New enforcement mechanism - brokers failing milestones will be barred from onboarding new retail algo clients from January 5, 2026

4. **Reporting Requirements**: Brokers not ready by October 1, 2025 must report existing client numbers as of September 30, 2025 in exchange-specified format

5. **Universal Application Date**: April 1, 2026 set as mandatory compliance date for all brokers regardless of milestone achievement

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**

- Brokers missing milestones face business restrictions limiting growth in retail algo segment from January 2026

**Broker Impact:**
- Technical and operational burden to implement API-based algo registration framework
- Resource allocation required for system development, testing, and mock session participation
- Risk of losing competitive position if milestones not met
- Need to coordinate with algo vendors for timely implementation

**Retail Investor Impact:**
- Enhanced safety framework for algo trading participation
- Potential service disruption if existing broker fails to meet milestones
- May need to evaluate broker capabilities for algo trading services
- Standardized framework across all brokers by April 2026

**Regulatory Impact:**
- Demonstrates regulatory flexibility while maintaining compliance expectations
- Clear enforcement mechanism through client onboarding restrictions
- Exchange monitoring role strengthened for milestone tracking
- Sets precedent for phased implementation of complex regulatory frameworks
