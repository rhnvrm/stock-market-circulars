## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced by this circular. This is a routine notification of securities listing as per existing ESOP/ESOS regulations.

- Trading members are informed of the new securities available for trading

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. ESOP shares represent a small percentage of total equity for each company and are issued as part of regular employee compensation practices.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible increase in tradeable shares. The largest issuance (Yes Bank with 1.29 million shares) represents a small fraction of its outstanding equity.

**Trading Impact:** No expected volatility or price pressure as ESOP allottees typically hold shares for medium to long-term periods.

**Investor Impact:** No direct impact on existing shareholders; dilution is minimal and anticipated as part of company compensation policies.
