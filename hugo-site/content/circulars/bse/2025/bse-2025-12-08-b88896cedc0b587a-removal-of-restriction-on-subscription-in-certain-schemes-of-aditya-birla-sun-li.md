title: Removal of Restriction on Subscription in Certain Schemes of Aditya Birla Sun
  Life Mutual Fund
---

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund has removed the restriction on maximum subscription amount of Rs. 10 crores per PAN per investor across all transactions for two of its schemes: Aditya Birla Sun Life Medium Term Plan and Aditya Birla Sun Life Credit Risk Fund. This change is effective from Monday, December 8, 2025.

## Key Points

- Maximum subscription limit of Rs. 10 crores per PAN per investor has been removed
- Applies to Aditya Birla Sun Life Medium Term Plan
- Applies to Aditya Birla Sun Life Credit Risk Fund
- Effective date: December 8, 2025 (Monday)
- All other scheme features and terms remain unchanged
- Addendum Number: 53/2025

## Regulatory Changes

The fund has lifted investment restrictions that previously capped individual investor subscriptions at Rs. 10 crores per PAN across all transactions. This allows high net worth individuals and institutional investors to invest larger amounts in the affected schemes without limitation.

## Compliance Requirements

- This notice-cum-addendum forms an integral part of the SID and KIM for the schemes
- Investors should read this addendum along with the current Scheme Information Document and Key Information Memorandum
- Standard mutual fund advisory applies: investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 4, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 8, 2025 (Monday)

## Impact Assessment

The removal of subscription limits may lead to increased fund inflows for both schemes, particularly from institutional investors and high net worth individuals who were previously restricted by the Rs. 10 crore cap. This could impact the fund size and potentially the investment strategies of these schemes. The Medium Term Plan and Credit Risk Fund may see enhanced liquidity and larger corpus, which could affect portfolio management and risk dynamics.
