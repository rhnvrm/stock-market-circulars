## Summary

BSE has announced scheduled maintenance for the CRS (Compliance and Risk Management System) portal on November 1, 2025. The portal will be unavailable from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, affecting all exchange members including those on the BSE StarMF Platform.

## Key Points

- Downtime period: 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM
- Affects all BSE members and BSE StarMF Platform users
- Reason: Scheduled maintenance activity
- Members will not be able to access or use the portal during this period

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members should plan their compliance and risk management activities accordingly
- Any CRS portal-related work should be completed before 8:00 AM or scheduled after 5:00 PM on November 1, 2025
- Members should ensure alternative arrangements for urgent matters during the downtime period

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

The scheduled 9-hour maintenance will temporarily disrupt access to the CRS portal for all exchange members.

Members should plan ahead to minimize operational impact by completing critical tasks before the maintenance window or deferring non-urgent activities until after 5:00 PM on November 1, 2025.
