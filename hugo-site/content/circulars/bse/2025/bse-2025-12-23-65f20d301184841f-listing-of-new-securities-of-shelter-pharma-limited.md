## Compliance Requirements

- Shares cannot be traded until respective lock-in dates expire
- Lock-in periods vary: majority until June 29-30, 2026, with some extending to June 30, 2027

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date 1:** October 1, 2025

- **Lock-in Expiry (Extended):** June 30, 2027 (for certain allottees)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a standard preferential allotment with lock-in restrictions, representing approximately 2.4% dilution assuming reasonable share capital base. The locked-in nature of shares prevents immediate market pressure.

**Trading Impact:** Limited near-term impact as shares are locked in for 18-20 months from allotment. Post lock-in expiry in mid-2026 and 2027, gradual supply increase may occur.

**Company Impact:** Positive for Shelter Pharma Limited as it raises capital for business operations. The premium pricing (Rs. 32.25 over face value) indicates investor confidence.
