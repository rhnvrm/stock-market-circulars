title: 'GSM Framework: 5 Securities Moving Across Surveillance Stages'

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of 5 securities across different stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective from the specified date. The movements include one security moving to Stage 0 (due to ESM framework inclusion), one to Stage I, one to Stage II, one to Stage III, and one to Stage IV, indicating varying levels of surveillance requirements.

## Key Points

- 5 securities are being moved across different GSM stages
- Tejassvi Aaharam Ltd (531628) moving to Stage 0 due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- Sadbhav Engineering Ltd (532710) moving to GSM Stage I
- Galaxy Agrico Exports Ltd (531911) moving to GSM Stage II
- SW Investments Ltd (503659) moving to GSM Stage III
- Sunraj Diamond Exports Ltd (523425) moving to GSM Stage IV
- Securities marked with (#) are moving to lower GSM stages due to ESM framework inclusion
- Securities marked with ($) would move to lower GSM stages due to IBC framework inclusion

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework continues to apply differential surveillance measures based on security-specific risk profiles. Securities moving to higher stages face more stringent surveillance including additional disclosure requirements, higher margins, and trade-to-trade settlement.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the GSM stage changes for affected securities
- Enhanced margin requirements will apply based on respective GSM stages
- Additional surveillance measures including price bands and trade restrictions may apply
- Investors should be aware of the increased surveillance status when trading these securities

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: December 22, 2025 (as per circular date)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Securities moving to higher GSM stages will face stricter trading conditions including higher margin requirements and potentially reduced liquidity. Stage IV placement of Sunraj Diamond Exports indicates highest surveillance concern.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding these securities should expect increased volatility monitoring, potential liquidity constraints, and stricter price movement restrictions. Tejassvi Aaharam's movement to Stage 0 due to ESM inclusion suggests serious regulatory concerns.

**Market Impact:** Limited broader market impact as only 5 securities are affected, but signals continued regulatory vigilance on securities exhibiting unusual price/volume patterns.
