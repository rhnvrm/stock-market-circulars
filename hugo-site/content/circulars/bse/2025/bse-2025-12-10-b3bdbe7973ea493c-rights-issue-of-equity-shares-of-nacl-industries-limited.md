## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium. The rights issue will potentially increase the share capital of NACL Industries by approximately 16.13% (5/31 ratio). The ex-rights trading may cause short-term price adjustments as the market factors in the dilution effect.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to ensure all transactions are executed on an ex-rights basis from December 12, 2025, to avoid settlement issues.
