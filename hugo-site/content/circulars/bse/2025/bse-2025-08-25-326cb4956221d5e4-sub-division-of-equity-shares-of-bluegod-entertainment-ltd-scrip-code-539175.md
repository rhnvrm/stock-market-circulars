## Summary

Bluegod Entertainment Ltd (Scrip Code: 539175) has announced the sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of Rs. 10 face value will be sub-divided into ten equity shares of Re. 1 face value each, with record date set as September 2, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Bluegod Entertainment Ltd (Scrip Code: 539175)
- Record Date: September 2, 2025
- Sub-division ratio: 1 share of Rs. 10 → 10 shares of Re. 1 each
- Effective date: September 2, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE924N01016) for Rs. 10 shares will become invalid
- New ISIN for Re. 1 shares to be announced separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE924N01016 for Rs. 10 paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after September 2, 2025. A new ISIN Number for Re. 1 paid-up shares will be communicated through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note the change in share structure and ensure proper handling of transactions post-subdivision. The company must provide new ISIN details for the subdivided shares.

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: September 2, 2025
- **Effective Date**: September 2, 2025
- **ISIN Validity**: Current ISIN invalid from September 2, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The share subdivision will increase the number of shares outstanding by 10 times while reducing the face value proportionally. This typically aims to improve liquidity and make shares more affordable for retail investors. Shareholders will hold 10 shares for every 1 share previously held, with no change in total investment value.
