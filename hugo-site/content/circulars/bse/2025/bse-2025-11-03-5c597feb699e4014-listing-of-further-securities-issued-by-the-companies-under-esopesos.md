## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The total number of shares being listed (949,462) represents routine ESOP/ESOS conversions across 9 companies. The dilution impact is negligible given the market capitalization of these companies, particularly ICICI Bank and HDFC AMC.

**Trading Impact:** No expected impact on trading patterns. These shares are immediately available for trading without restrictions.

**Liquidity Impact:** Marginal increase in available float for each company. The largest addition is Fedbank Financial Services (348,312 shares) and ICICI Bank (167,440 shares).

**Investor Considerations:** This is part of normal employee compensation practices and reflects healthy employee participation in company ownership. No adverse implications for existing shareholders.
