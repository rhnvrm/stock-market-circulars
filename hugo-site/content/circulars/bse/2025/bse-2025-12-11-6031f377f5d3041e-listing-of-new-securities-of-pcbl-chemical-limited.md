These shares were issued to promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to conversion of warrants at an issue price of Rs. 280 per share (face value Rs. 1 with premium of Rs. 279). The shares are subject to a lock-in period until June 30, 2027.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the new securities available for trading from December 12, 2025
- Lock-in restrictions apply to all 1.6 crore shares until June 30, 2027

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: November 3, 2025
- **Listing Date**: December 12, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of 1.6 crore new shares represents a significant equity issuance to promoters through warrant conversion. The 2.5-year lock-in period (until June 30, 2027) ensures these shares cannot be immediately traded, mitigating short-term supply pressure on the stock.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will experience dilution as the equity base expands. However, since the shares are issued to promoters, this indicates promoter confidence and increased promoter stake in the company.

**Operational Impact**: The preferential allotment at Rs. 280 per share will bring substantial capital (approximately Rs. 448 crore) to PCBL Chemical Limited, potentially for business expansion, debt reduction, or working capital requirements. The pari-passu ranking ensures new shares have equal rights with existing shares.
