- Members should ensure their systems reflect the updated face value for trading and settlement purposes

## Important Dates

- **December 11, 2025**: Circular issued
- **December 16, 2025**: Record date for part redemption and interest payment
- **December 16, 2025**: Effective date for trading with reduced face value (Settlement DR-778/2025-2026)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. It affects only holders of specific debentures (PDPL-7.30%-31-12-26-PVT) of Prayatna Developers Private Limited. The part redemption reduces the outstanding face value per debenture to Rs. 507041. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face value for accurate trading and settlement. No broader market or operational implications are expected.
