## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 89 scrips with varying quantities. While routine in nature, the auction mechanism ensures settlement of failed delivery obligations.

**Broker Impact:** Medium - Brokers with outstanding delivery obligations in these scrips must participate in the auction, potentially incurring additional costs.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Investors whose shares are subject to auction may face settlement delays, but the auction mechanism ensures eventual settlement.

**Notable Securities:** The list includes several high-profile stocks (Infosys, ICICI Bank, Adani Power, JSW Energy, Dr. Reddy's, Divi's Labs) indicating delivery failures across market segments. The presence of large quantities in some scrips (Eraaya Lifespaces: 57,078 shares, IKOMA Techno: 10,763 shares) suggests significant settlement issues in these securities.
