## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 23 securities across various sectors including PSUs, IT, manufacturing, and infrastructure. The shut periods will temporarily restrict SLB liquidity for these stocks.

**Operational Impact:** SLB participants must plan position closures or rollovers before shut periods. The staggered dates (Nov 14-21) distribute the impact across multiple trading sessions.

**Investor Impact:** Dividend announcements are generally positive for shareholders. Adani Enterprises rights issue requires special attention from investors and SLB participants due to foreclosure date alignment with ex-date on November 17, 2025.

**Liquidity Impact:** Temporary reduction in borrowing/lending activity for affected securities during shut periods. Major PSUs like ONGC, IRCTC, and Container Corporation may see notable SLB liquidity constraints.
