## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 108 securities across various market segments. Large quantities in certain scrips like SPRIGHT AGRO may experience temporary price pressure during auction.

**Operational Impact:** Specific to members with delivery failures and holders of these securities. The auction mechanism ensures settlement completion but may result in price volatility for affected scrips during the auction period.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders of auctioned securities should monitor price movements. Buyers in the original settlement may face delays in receiving shares until auction completion.
