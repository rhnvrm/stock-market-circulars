This auction is conducted to settle delivery failures where selling members have failed to deliver securities on the settlement date.

## Key Points

- Settlement Number: 766
- Auction Date: December 1, 2025
- Total Scrips Listed: 102 securities
- Quantities range from 1 share to 50,000 shares depending on the scrip

- Covers diverse sectors including banking, infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, textiles, automotive, and technology

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Clearing members with shortages must participate in the demat auction or arrange delivery of securities
- Buyers who have not received delivery will receive securities through this auction mechanism
- Members must settle their obligations as per BSE auction rules and timelines
- Payment and delivery obligations must be completed as per auction settlement schedule

## Important Dates

- Auction Settlement Date: December 1, 2025
- Settlement Number: 766

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 102 scrips across various sectors. While this is a routine settlement mechanism, the large quantity in some scrips (particularly IRB Infrastructure with 50,000 shares) may create temporary demand in the auction.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading members with delivery failures must participate in the auction, which involves additional costs (auction charges, price differences). The auction mechanism ensures delivery to buyers but at potentially higher prices.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - End investors who were buyers of these securities will receive delivery through the auction mechanism. Selling members bear the cost differential and auction charges for their failure to deliver.
