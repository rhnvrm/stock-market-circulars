**Market Impact:** Medium - The holiday schedule affects liquidity planning for Currency Derivatives and Debt market participants throughout 2026. With 19 weekday holidays, market participants need to adjust trading strategies and settlement schedules accordingly.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading members must incorporate these dates into their operational calendars, risk management systems, and client communication. The concentration of holidays in March-April (6 holidays) and October-November (4 holidays) requires particular attention for position management and settlement planning.

**Trading Impact:** The Muhurat Trading session on November 8, 2026 (Sunday) is a special trading opportunity during Diwali, with timings to be announced separately. Participants should prepare for this non-standard trading day.
