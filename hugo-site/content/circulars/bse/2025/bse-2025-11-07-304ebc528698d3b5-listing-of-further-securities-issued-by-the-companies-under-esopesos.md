None of the listed securities are under lock-in restrictions.

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies have completed the listing process for shares issued under their employee stock option programs
- All securities will be tradable without restrictions from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 7, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date**: Monday, November 10, 2025
- **Lock-in Period**: Not applicable (NA) for all securities

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. ESOP/ESOS listings are routine corporate actions that represent relatively small dilutions to existing share capital. The largest issuance by Urban Company (10.2 million shares) may have slightly more visibility given the quantum, but employee stock options typically have staggered vesting and exercise patterns that minimize immediate selling pressure. For established large-caps like AXIS Bank and L&T, the issuances represent negligible dilution percentages.
