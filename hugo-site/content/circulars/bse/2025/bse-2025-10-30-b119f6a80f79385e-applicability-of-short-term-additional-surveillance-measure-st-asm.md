title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective October 31, 2025. The circular identifies 4 new securities being added to ST-ASM, 1 security moving to higher stage ASM, and 7 securities exiting the ST-ASM framework. The consolidated list includes securities across various ST-ASM stages with different surveillance levels.

## Key Points

- 4 new securities shortlisted under Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework: Amanaya Ventures Ltd, Mittal Sections Ltd, Rachit Prints Ltd, and Sunsky Logistics Ltd (all SME scrips)
- KBS India Ltd will move to higher Stage ASM while continuing in ST-ASM framework
- No securities are moving to lower Stage ASM
- 7 securities are exiting ST-ASM framework, with most transitioning to other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM)
- Framework includes special markings for SME scrips (@), T+0 scrips (~), and securities transitioning to other frameworks
- Consolidated list provides comprehensive view of all securities currently under ST-ASM with their respective stages

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to apply staged surveillance measures (5/15/30 days) to securities exhibiting unusual price movements or trading patterns. Securities can migrate between stages or move to other surveillance frameworks including:

- Long Term ASM (LT-ASM) Framework
- Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework
- Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) Framework
- Trade for Trade Framework
- Pledge Framework

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement surveillance parameters for newly added securities from October 31, 2025
- Securities under ST-ASM are subject to price bands and additional margin requirements as per framework stage
- SME scrips marked with @ require special attention under surveillance measures
- Members must update their systems to reflect stage migrations and exits from ST-ASM framework

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 31, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The framework affects 24+ securities with varying levels of surveillance, potentially reducing liquidity and increasing trading costs for affected scrips.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will face additional margin requirements and trading restrictions. Securities moving to higher stages face stricter surveillance.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to update risk management systems and inform clients about changed trading parameters for affected securities.

**Exit Transitions**: 7 securities exiting ST-ASM framework indicates either improved trading behavior or migration to more stringent surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM), which may have longer-term implications for those securities.
