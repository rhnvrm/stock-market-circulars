## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine rights issue listing for a single company with no broader market implications.

**Investor Impact**: Moderate for existing shareholders who participated in the rights issue. Shareholders hold partly paid-up shares with future payment obligations of Rs. 7.50/- per share on calls to be made by the Board.

**Trading Impact**: The shares will trade in the 'X' Group, which may have different trading rules and surveillance measures compared to regular groups. Dividend entitlement is proportionate to the amount paid-up (currently 25%).

**Liquidity Considerations**: Market lot of 1 share allows for flexible trading. However, the partly paid-up nature and X Group classification may affect liquidity and investor participation.
