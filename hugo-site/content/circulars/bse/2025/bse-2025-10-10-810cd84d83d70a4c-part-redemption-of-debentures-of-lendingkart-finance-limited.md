## Impact Assessment

This part redemption will impact holders of Lendingkart Finance Limited's non-convertible debentures. The reduction in face value from the original amount to Rs. 33,333.33 per debenture reflects a partial return of principal to debenture holders. Trading members and investors holding these securities must account for the reduced face value in their portfolios and trading systems. The impact is limited to holders of this specific debenture series and does not affect broader market operations.
