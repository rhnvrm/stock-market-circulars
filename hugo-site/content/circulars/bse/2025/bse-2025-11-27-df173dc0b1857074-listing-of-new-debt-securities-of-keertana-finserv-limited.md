- Debt market participants and institutional investors interested in BBB+ rated securities
- Investors seeking monthly income instruments with 11.40% p.a. returns
- Trading members dealing in debt securities who need to update their systems with the new scrip details

The securities are privately placed with a relatively small issue size (50,000 units), limiting broader market implications.
