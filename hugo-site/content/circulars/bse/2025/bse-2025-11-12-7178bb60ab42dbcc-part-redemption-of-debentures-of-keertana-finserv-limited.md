## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The part redemption affects a privately placed debenture of Keertana Finserv Limited. Existing debenture holders will receive partial redemption proceeds and interest payment based on holdings as of the record date. Post-redemption, the face value of remaining debentures will be Rs. 6,800, and all subsequent trading will reflect this reduced value. The impact is limited to holders of this specific debt security.
