title: Exclusion of SLB Contracts of Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilisers Limited (MANGCHEFER)
  from SLB Segment
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the exclusion of Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilisers Limited (MANGCHEFER, Scrip Code: 530011) from the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) segment effective October 31, 2025. This action is consequent to the amalgamation of the company as notified in earlier exchange notices 20251027-13 and 20251027-1. No SLB contracts will be available for trading in this security from the effective date.

## Key Points

- MANGCHEFER (Scrip Code: 530011, SLB Code: MANGCHEFER) to be excluded from SLB segment
- Exclusion follows amalgamation proceedings of Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilisers Limited
- No new SLB contracts will be available for trading from ex-date
- Trading members must note the cessation of SLB trading activity

## Regulatory Changes

The security MANGCHEFER will no longer be available for Securities Lending and Borrowing transactions on BSE. This represents a removal from the eligible securities list for the SLB segment, preventing market participants from entering into new lending/borrowing contracts for this scrip.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must:
- Note the exclusion of MANGCHEFER from SLB segment systems
- Ensure no new SLB contracts are initiated for this security from October 31, 2025
- Update internal trading systems and member communications accordingly
- Refer to earlier notices (20251027-13 & 20251027-1) regarding the underlying amalgamation for complete context

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 30, 2025
- **Ex-Date/Effective Date**: October 31, 2025 - MANGCHEFER excluded from SLB segment

## Impact Assessment

The impact is primarily on market participants actively using the SLB segment for MANGCHEFER securities. Existing positions will need to be squared off or settled according to standard SLB settlement procedures. The exclusion is a procedural consequence of the company's amalgamation and affects a specialized trading segment rather than regular equity trading. Traders relying on securities lending/borrowing for this scrip will need to adjust their strategies accordingly.
