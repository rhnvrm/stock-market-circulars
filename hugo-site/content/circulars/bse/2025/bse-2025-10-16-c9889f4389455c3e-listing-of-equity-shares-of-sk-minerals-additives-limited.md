## Impact Assessment

**Market Liquidity**: Initially, only 2,560,000 shares (20.9% of total) are freely tradable. The phased unlock will progressively increase tradable float from November 2025 through October 2028.

**Price Discovery**: Limited free float at listing may result in higher volatility during initial trading sessions.

**Long-term Impact**: Gradual unlock over 3 years will provide staggered liquidity events, with the largest unlock (6.44 million shares or 52.6% of issue) occurring between October 2026-2028.
