**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine NFO launch for a passive fund of funds investing in gold and silver. It provides investors with an option to diversify into precious metals through a mutual fund structure.

**Investor Impact**: Low to medium for mutual fund investors interested in gold and silver exposure. The passive FOF structure offers a convenient way to gain exposure to precious metals without directly investing in physical gold/silver or individual ETFs.

**Operational Impact**: Standard NFO procedures apply. Members operating on BSE StAR MF Platform need to follow specified fund settlement timelines and ensure compliance with payment deadlines to avoid transaction cancellations.
