- Company confirmed all material events and information have been disclosed to stock exchanges in compliance with Regulation 30 of SEBI LODR Regulations
- Volume increase appears to be market driven and may be influenced by increase in public float over time
- **CCL Products (India) Limited** responded to BSE reference L/SURV/ONL/PV/AA/2025-2026/664

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - The volume movements are confirmed to be market-driven rather than related to undisclosed material information. No price or trading restrictions imposed.

**Operational Impact**: None - These are routine surveillance queries and responses. No operational changes required.

**Investor Impact**: Low - The clarifications provide transparency that no material undisclosed information exists, and companies remain compliant with disclosure obligations. The volume increases for Astral Limited may be partially attributed to increased public float over time, which is a normal corporate development.
