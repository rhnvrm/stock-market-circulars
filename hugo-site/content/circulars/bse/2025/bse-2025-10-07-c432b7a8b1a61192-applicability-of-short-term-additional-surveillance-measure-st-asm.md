- Brokers must ensure compliance with applicable trading restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 08, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The ST-ASM framework aims to curb excessive speculation and protect investor interests in volatile securities. Securities under this measure may face:
- Reduced liquidity due to enhanced surveillance
- Higher margin requirements for trading
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Potential impact on trading volumes

Investors should exercise caution when trading in securities under surveillance measures and be aware of the associated risks and restrictions.
