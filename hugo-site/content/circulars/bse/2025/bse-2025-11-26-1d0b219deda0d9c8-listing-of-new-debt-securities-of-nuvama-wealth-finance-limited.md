## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine debt securities listing that affects only investors and trading members dealing with Nuvama Wealth Finance Limited's debt instruments. The securities were issued on private placement basis, limiting the initial investor base.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - Trading members dealing in debt securities need to be aware of the new scrip code and ISIN for order placement and settlement. The dematerialized-only trading requirement is standard for modern debt securities.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to subscribers of the private placement and secondary market buyers. The AA/Stable rating indicates relatively strong credit quality. The discount to face value (Rs. 97,346 vs Rs. 100,000) reflects prevailing market yields for such instruments.

**Issuer Context**: Nuvama Wealth Finance Limited is accessing debt capital markets through private placement, with gold futures-linked securities adding to its funding mix.
