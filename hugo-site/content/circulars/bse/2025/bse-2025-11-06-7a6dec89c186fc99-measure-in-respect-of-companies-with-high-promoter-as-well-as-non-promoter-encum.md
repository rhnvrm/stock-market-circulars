## Summary

BSE has updated the list of securities under surveillance measures for companies with high promoter and non-promoter encumbrance as per Regulation 28(3) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulation 2011. The changes are effective from November 07, 2025. One security has been added to the framework while no securities are moving out.

## Key Points

- Onelife Capital Advisors Ltd (Scrip Code: 533632, ISIN: INE912L01015) added to the high encumbrance surveillance framework
- No securities are being removed from the framework as of this update
- Consolidated list now contains 2 securities: India Finsec Ltd and Onelife Capital Advisors Ltd
- Framework monitors companies with high levels of pledged/encumbered shares held by both promoters and non-promoters

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements SEBI's surveillance framework under Regulation 28(3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulation 2011, which monitors securities where significant shareholdings are encumbered. The framework aims to protect investor interests by identifying companies with elevated risk due to pledged shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note the inclusion of Onelife Capital Advisors Ltd in this surveillance measure
- Trading members and investors should exercise appropriate caution when dealing in securities under this framework
- Companies in this framework are subject to enhanced disclosure and monitoring requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 07, 2025
- Onelife Capital Advisors Ltd enters the high encumbrance surveillance framework from this date

## Impact Assessment

The addition of Onelife Capital Advisors Ltd to the high encumbrance framework indicates elevated risk due to significant pledging of shares by promoters and non-promoters. This may impact investor sentiment and trading activity in the affected security. The surveillance measure serves as a cautionary signal to market participants about the financial stress or liquidity constraints that may be affecting the company. The consolidated framework now monitors 2 securities for compliance with encumbrance disclosure norms.
