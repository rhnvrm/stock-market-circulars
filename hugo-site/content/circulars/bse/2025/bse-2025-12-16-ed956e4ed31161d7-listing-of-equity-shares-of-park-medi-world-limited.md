## Impact Assessment

Medium impact for market participants. The listing adds a new equity security to BSE with a total share capital of 431.93 million shares. High promoter holding (82.89%) indicates strong promoter control. Substantial lock-in of 90.80% of total shares (including all promoter shares and 46.19% of public shares) will restrict free float availability in the near term. Public holding of 17.11% meets minimum public shareholding norms for listed companies. The presence of 222,728 public shareholders indicates good retail participation in the IPO. Investors should note the limited free float due to lock-in restrictions when assessing liquidity.
