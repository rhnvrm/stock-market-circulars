## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine operational matter affecting only specific mutual fund schemes on predetermined holiday dates.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Investors in affected international and fund-of-funds schemes will be unable to execute transactions on specified dates. However, these are predictable closures aligned with overseas market holidays and the Indian Republic Day.

**Operational Impact:** Investors planning to invest, redeem, or switch units in the affected schemes should plan their transactions around these non-business days. The impact is limited to the specific schemes listed and does not affect domestic equity, debt, or hybrid funds (except where specifically mentioned).
