## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the listing of new securities
- Lock-in restrictions must be observed as per SEBI regulations:
  - 8,50,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 1544370204-1545220203): Lock-in until May 23, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: October 13, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: November 24, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry (Tranche 1)**: May 23, 2026 (8,50,000 shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The preferential allotment of over 10.4 crore shares represents significant equity dilution for existing shareholders. The staggered lock-in structure with majority shares (80.96 lakh) locked until May 2027 provides stability and prevents immediate selling pressure.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders experience dilution, but the lock-in provisions ensure promoter/investor commitment. The premium pricing (Rs. 109.51 over face value) indicates investor confidence. The 18-24 month lock-in periods align with regulatory requirements for preferential allotments.

**Trading Impact**: New shares will add liquidity to the stock from November 24, 2025, though majority remain locked for extended periods. Market participants should track lock-in expiry dates for potential supply increase.
