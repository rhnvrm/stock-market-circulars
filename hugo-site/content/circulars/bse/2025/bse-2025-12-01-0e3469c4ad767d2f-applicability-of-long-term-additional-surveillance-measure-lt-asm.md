**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to update their systems to reflect the LT-ASM status for Caprolactam Chemicals Ltd. Additional margin and deposit requirements may apply for trading in this security.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading Caprolactam Chemicals Ltd should be aware of enhanced surveillance measures that may include higher margins, deposit requirements, or trading restrictions depending on the specific ASM stage applicable.
