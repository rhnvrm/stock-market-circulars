## Impact Assessment

The listing has minimal market impact as it involves a relatively small number of shares (146,000) for a single company. The lock-in period until June 15, 2026 means these shares will not contribute to float or trading volume immediately. The preferential allotment to non-promoters indicates fundraising activity by the company. Trading members should note the lock-in restrictions when handling orders for this scrip.
