## Impact Assessment

**Market Liquidity**: Approximately 31% of shares (20,67,65,939 shares under various lock-ins) are restricted from trading for different periods, which limits immediate free float. However, 6,39,12,996 shares from public issue, ESOP, and certain AIF holdings are immediately tradeable.

**Trading Impact**: The staggered lock-in expiry dates will gradually increase available float over the next 3 years, with significant unlocking events in January 2026 (anchor investors) and June 2026 (major promoter holdings).

**Investor Considerations**: Large institutional and promoter holdings are locked for extended periods, providing stability but reducing liquidity. ESOP and public shareholders have immediate trading flexibility.
