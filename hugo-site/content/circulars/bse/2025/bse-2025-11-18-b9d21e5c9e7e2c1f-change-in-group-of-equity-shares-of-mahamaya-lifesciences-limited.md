This change follows the company's SME IPO listing and represents a transition to normal trading operations.

## Key Points

- Effective Date: Monday, December 1, 2025
- Notice Number: 20251118-5
- Contact: Mr. Anurag Jain, Tel: 022-2272 8822

## Regulatory Changes

The equity shares will transition from the restrictive Trade for Trade (T2T) segment to the Rolling settlement segment. This change allows for:
- Normal intraday trading (previously restricted in T2T)
- Standard settlement cycles instead of compulsory delivery-based trading
- Improved liquidity and trading flexibility

## Compliance Requirements

- Note the change in trading segment effective December 1, 2025
- Update their systems to reflect the new group classification (M Group)
- Contact Mr. Anurag Jain for any clarifications or technical details

## Important Dates

- **November 17, 2025**: Initial notice issued (Notice No. 20251117-58)
- **November 18, 2025**: Current notice date
- **December 1, 2025**: Effective date for segment transfer from MT to M Group

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The transition from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment typically increases liquidity and trading volumes as it removes delivery restrictions. This is positive for existing shareholders and potential investors.

**Trading Impact**: The change enables intraday trading and standard settlement mechanisms, making the stock more accessible to retail and institutional traders. Previously, T2T segment requires 100% upfront margin and compulsory delivery, which limits trading activity.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will benefit from improved liquidity and easier exit options. The stock becomes eligible for margin trading and other normal market mechanisms available in the Rolling segment.
