## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine debt listing with no market-wide implications. The securities are issued on private placement basis and will trade in the debt segment.

**Investor Impact**: Relevant for debt investors seeking fixed-income securities with IND A-/Stable rating. The 10.25% interest rate may be attractive for investors in the current rate environment.

**Company Impact**: Provides STL Networks Limited with additional debt capital for business operations with a tenure of approximately 2.75 years from allotment.

**Liquidity**: Trading in market lot of 1 unit with tick size of 1 paise provides granular pricing but the high face value (Rs. 1 lakh per unit) limits accessibility to institutional and high net worth investors.
