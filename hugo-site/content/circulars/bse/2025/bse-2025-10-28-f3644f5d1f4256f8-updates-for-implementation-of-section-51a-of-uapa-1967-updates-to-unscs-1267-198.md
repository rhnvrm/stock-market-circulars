## Important Dates

- **21 October 2025**: Amendment to sanctions list entry enacted by UN Security Council Committee
- **28 October 2025**: BSE circular issued notifying market participants
- **Immediate**: Compliance required with updated sanctions list

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited direct market impact as this affects a single individual entry in the sanctions list. However, compliance is mandatory for all market participants.

**Operational Impact**: Market intermediaries must update their sanctions screening databases and AML/CFT systems to reflect the amended entry. This requires immediate action to ensure compliance with international sanctions obligations.

**Regulatory Impact**: High regulatory significance as non-compliance with UAPA and UN sanctions can result in severe penalties. Financial institutions must maintain robust sanctions screening processes to prevent dealings with designated individuals and entities.

**Compliance Risk**: Failure to implement updated sanctions lists may expose market participants to legal, regulatory, and reputational risks, including potential penalties under UAPA, 1967 and international sanctions regimes.
