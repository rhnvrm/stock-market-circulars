---

## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in non-convertible debentures of Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. (HCC) effective December 31, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for early redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the no-dealing date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies to HCC debentures with ISIN: INE549A07239 (Security Code: 974248)
- Debenture series: HCCL-0.01%-31-3-26-PVT
- Record date fixed: December 31, 2025
- No dealings permitted from: December 31, 2025
- Purpose: Early redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Circular reference: DR-788/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action notification for debenture redemption following established BSE procedures for debt securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all trading activity in the specified HCC debentures from December 31, 2025
- Members should update their systems to prevent inadvertent trading in these securities
- Debenture holders as of record date (December 31, 2025) will be eligible for redemption proceeds and interest payment
- Trading members must communicate this suspension to their clients holding these debentures

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 29, 2025
- **Record Date**: December 31, 2025
- **No Dealings From**: December 31, 2025
- **Redemption Event**: Early redemption of debentures and interest payment

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of this specific HCC debenture series. The early redemption provides liquidity to debenture holders but removes this instrument from trading.

**Investor Impact**: High for existing debenture holders who must hold their positions through record date to receive redemption proceeds. No new positions can be established from December 31, 2025.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update trading systems and communicate with affected clients. The 0.01% coupon rate indicates this is a deeply discounted or special purpose debenture series.

**Liquidity Impact**: Trading suspension eliminates secondary market liquidity for this instrument, though this is temporary as redemption will provide exit to holders.
