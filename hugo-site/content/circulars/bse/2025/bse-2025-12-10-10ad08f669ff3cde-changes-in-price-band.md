## Regulatory Changes

The price band mechanism limits the maximum price movement (up or down) that a stock can experience in a single trading day. Tighter bands (2%, 5%) indicate enhanced surveillance and restrict volatility, while wider bands (20%) allow greater price discovery.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands from December 11, 2025
- All orders must be placed within the specified price band limits
- Members can contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com for clarifications

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 10, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 11, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The revision of price bands is a surveillance measure typically applied to stocks exhibiting unusual price movements or requiring enhanced monitoring. Stricter bands (2% for Continental Controls and Rotographics) significantly limit intraday volatility and may impact liquidity. The 5% band applied to majority of the securities represents a moderate surveillance level. KSR Footwear's 20% band suggests normal market operations with standard volatility limits. Traders and investors in these securities should adjust their trading strategies accordingly.
