This change is in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251210-12 dated December 10, 2025, and will be effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of December 26, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN number: INE531F01023
- Company: NUVAMA WEALTH MANAGEMENT LTD
- Scrip Code: 543988
- Corporate action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Rs.2/- (1:5 split)
- New face value: Rs.2/- per equity share
- Effective for trades from ex-date: December 26, 2025
- Debit reference: DR-785/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action implementation notice updating the ISIN identification code for the subdivided shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to recognize the new ISIN INE531F01023 for trades executed on and after December 26, 2025
- All market participants should ensure proper mapping of the new ISIN in their trading and settlement systems
- Existing shareholders will receive subdivided shares in 1:5 ratio (each Rs.10/- share converted to 5 shares of Rs.2/- each)

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 17, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: December 26, 2025 (new ISIN becomes effective)
- **Prior Notice Reference**: Exchange Notice No. 20251210-12 dated December 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The stock split increases share liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors. The change in ISIN requires system updates across all market participants.

**Operational Impact**: Trading and settlement systems must be updated to handle the new ISIN from the ex-date. Investors holding shares will see their holdings automatically adjusted to reflect the 1:5 subdivision ratio, with total investment value remaining unchanged.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares of Rs.2/- face value for every 1 share of Rs.10/- face value held. This improves liquidity and reduces the per-share price, potentially making the stock more accessible to smaller investors.
