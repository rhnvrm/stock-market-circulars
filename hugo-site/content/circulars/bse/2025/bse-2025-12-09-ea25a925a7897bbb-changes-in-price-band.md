## Regulatory Changes

This circular represents a surveillance measure under BSE's authority to modify price bands for specific securities. Price bands are restrictions on the maximum price movement (both upward and downward) allowed for a security in a single trading session. Tighter price bands are typically imposed on securities exhibiting high volatility, low liquidity, or other risk factors requiring enhanced surveillance.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement the revised price bands in their systems before market open on December 10, 2025
- Orders exceeding the revised price band limits will be rejected
- Members must communicate these changes to their clients trading in the affected securities
- For clarifications, members should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 9, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The tighter price bands will reduce intraday price volatility for these 13 securities, potentially improving price discovery but also reducing liquidity. Securities with 2% bands will face severe trading restrictions, limiting arbitrage and speculative activity.

**Trading Impact**: Investors and traders will experience reduced flexibility in these securities. Large orders may need to be executed over multiple sessions. The narrow bands may lead to more frequent circuit filter hits.

**Investor Protection**: These measures protect retail investors from excessive price manipulation and volatility in potentially vulnerable securities, though they also limit profit opportunities from legitimate price movements.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading systems must update price band parameters, and trading desks need to adjust their strategies for affected securities.
