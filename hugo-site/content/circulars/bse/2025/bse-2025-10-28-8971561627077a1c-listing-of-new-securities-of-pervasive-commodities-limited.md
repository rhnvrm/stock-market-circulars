## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to update their systems for the new securities
- Lock-in restrictions must be enforced as per the specified lock-in period
- All 90 crore shares are subject to lock-in provisions

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: May 20, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: October 29, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: May 5, 2026 (for all 90 crore shares with Dist. Nos. 952201 to 900952200)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of 90 crore equity shares represents substantial dilution in the company's equity capital. However, the immediate market impact is mitigated by the lock-in period extending until May 5, 2026, which prevents these shares from being traded freely for approximately 6 months.

**Operational Impact**: The shares were issued to non-promoters through warrant conversion at par value of Re. 1/-, indicating fundraising at face value. This suggests either a distressed situation or a strategic investment by non-promoter entities. The lock-in period provides stability during the interim period.

**Investor Consideration**: Existing shareholders should note the significant increase in equity base. The preferential allotment to non-promoters at par value and subsequent lock-in until May 2026 are key factors for monitoring shareholding pattern changes.
