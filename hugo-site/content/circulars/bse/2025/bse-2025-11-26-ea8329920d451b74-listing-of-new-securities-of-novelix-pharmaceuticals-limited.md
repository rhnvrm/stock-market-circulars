## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine preferential allotment listing resulting from warrant conversion. The issuance represents capital raising activity by the company.

**Lock-in Details**: Out of 15,45,000 shares, 9,00,000 shares have a lock-in period until June 30, 2027 (approximately 58.25% of new shares), while 6,45,000 shares are locked-in until June 30, 2026 (approximately 41.75% of new shares). This ensures controlled entry of these shares into the market.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution from the preferential allotment. The lock-in periods provide some stability by preventing immediate sale of all new shares.
