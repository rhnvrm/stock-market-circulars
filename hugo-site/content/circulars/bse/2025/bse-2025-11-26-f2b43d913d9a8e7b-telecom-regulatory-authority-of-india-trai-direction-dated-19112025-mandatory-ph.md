title: Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Direction dated 19.11.2025 - Mandatory
  Phase-wise Adoption of 1600-Series Numbers
---

## Summary

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a direction dated November 19, 2025, mandating phase-wise implementation of 1600-series numbers for service and transactional voice calls by entities regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). This directive aims to curb promotional calls made under the guise of service and transactional calls, which often result in spam and potential scams. The 1600-series was allocated exclusively for Government entities and BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) sector entities by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on December 23, 2024.

## Key Points

- TRAI issues direction under section 13, read with sub-clauses (i) and (v) of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 11 of the TRAI Act, 1997
- Mandatory phase-wise adoption of 1600-series numbers for RBI, SEBI and PFRDA regulated entities
- 1600-series allocated by DoT on December 23, 2024 exclusively for Government and BFSI entities
- TRAI directed Access Providers to initiate allocation on December 31, 2024
- Low adoption rate despite consumer awareness campaigns, with most entities continuing to use ten-digit mobile numbers
- Authority interacted with sector regulators (RBI, PFRDA, SEBI) regarding implementation

## Regulatory Changes

The direction mandates a shift from ten-digit mobile numbers to the 1600-series for service and transactional voice calls by BFSI entities. This builds upon:

- **Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018 (6 of 2018)**: Regulation 3 requires commercial communications to use registered headers or special number resources
- **DoT Letter dated December 23, 2024**: Allocated separate 1600-series numbering for Service and Transactional Voice Calls
- **TRAI Letter dated December 31, 2024**: Directed all Access Providers to initiate allocation of 1600-series to eligible entities

The new numbering series provides BFSI entities with a distinct identity, segregating them from other callers and enabling consumers to make informed decisions regarding call acceptance.

## Compliance Requirements

Entities regulated by RBI, SEBI and PFRDA must:

1. Adopt 1600-series numbers for all service and transactional voice calls on a phase-wise basis
2. Discontinue use of ten-digit mobile numbers for service and transactional communications
3. Register with Access Providers for allocation of 1600-series numbers
4. Ensure all commercial communications comply with Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018
5. Coordinate with telecom Access Providers for technical implementation

Failure to comply may result in telecom resources being suspended or disconnected as per the regulations.

## Important Dates

- **December 23, 2024**: DoT allocated 1600-series for Government and BFSI entities
- **December 31, 2024**: TRAI directed Access Providers to initiate allocation
- **November 19, 2025**: TRAI issued direction for mandatory phase-wise adoption
- **Phase-wise implementation dates**: To be specified in subsequent communications (document appears incomplete)

## Impact Assessment

**Consumer Protection Impact**: High - The measure aims to significantly reduce spam calls and potential scams by clearly distinguishing legitimate service calls from promotional calls disguised as transactional communications.

**Operational Impact**: High - All RBI, SEBI and PFRDA regulated entities must implement new calling systems, update customer databases, conduct customer awareness campaigns, and coordinate with telecom providers for number allocation.

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects the entire BFSI sector including banks, insurance companies, securities brokers, pension funds, and other financial institutions. Enhanced consumer trust may improve customer engagement rates.

**Technology Impact**: Significant infrastructure changes required for call routing systems, IVR platforms, CRM systems, and caller ID configurations.

**Compliance Risk**: Non-compliance may result in suspension or disconnection of telecom resources, potentially disrupting customer service operations.
