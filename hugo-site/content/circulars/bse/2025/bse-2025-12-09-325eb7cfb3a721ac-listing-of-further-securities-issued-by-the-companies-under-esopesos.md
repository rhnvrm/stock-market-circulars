## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. ESOP issuances are routine administrative matters representing employee compensation. The share quantities are relatively small and will have negligible impact on stock prices or trading volumes.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in floating stock for these companies. Shares may be sold immediately as there are no lock-in restrictions, but employee shareholders typically hold for longer periods.

**Sector Distribution**: Financial services sector dominates with 5 of 9 companies (Aadhar Housing, City Union Bank, CreditAccess Grameen, Emkay Global, IDFC FIRST Bank, India Shelter), indicating active employee incentivization in this sector.
