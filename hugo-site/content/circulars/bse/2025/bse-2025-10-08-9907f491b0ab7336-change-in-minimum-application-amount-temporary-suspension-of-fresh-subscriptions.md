## Key Points

- Daily SIP minimum instalment reduced to Rs. 10 for Equity and Hybrid Schemes (online mode and digital platforms)
- Daily SIP minimum instalment for Liquid Fund set at Rs. 30 (online mode and digital platforms)
- Liquid Fund Growth option minimum application amount reduced from Rs. 500 to Rs. 100
- Fresh subscriptions suspended for Aditya Birla Sun Life International Equity Fund, Global Emerging Opportunities Fund, and Global Excellence Equity Fund of Fund
- Existing SIP/STP registrations made before effective date will continue to be processed
- No new SIP/STP registrations accepted for suspended schemes from effective date

## Regulatory Changes

**Daily SIP Modifications (Effective October 8, 2025):**
- Equity and Hybrid Schemes: Rs. 10 and multiples of Re. 1 thereafter
- Liquid Fund: Rs. 30 and multiples of Re. 1 thereafter
- Applies only to Daily SIP through online mode and digital platforms
- AMC reserves right to modify features and restrict applicable schemes

**Liquid Fund Application Amount (Effective October 8, 2025):**
- Previous: Rs. 500 and multiples of Re. 1
- Revised: Rs. 100 and multiples of Re. 1
- Applies to Growth option only

## Compliance Requirements

**For Investors:**
- Fresh subscription/switch-in applications in three international schemes received post cut-off time on October 7, 2025 will not be processed
- No fresh SIP/STP registrations accepted for suspended schemes from October 7, 2025
- Existing SIP/STP installments registered before October 7, 2025 will continue as scheduled

**For Fund Manager:**
- Update SAI (Statement of Additional Information), SID (Scheme Information Document), and KIM (Key Information Memorandum)
- Process existing systematic transactions for suspended schemes if registered before effective date

## Important Dates

- **October 7, 2025 (Tuesday)**: Effective date for suspension of fresh subscriptions in three international equity schemes
- **October 8, 2025 (Wednesday)**: Effective date for Daily SIP modifications and Liquid Fund minimum application amount change
- **October 6, 2025**: Date of circular issuance

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts:**
- Lower entry barriers for retail investors with reduced minimum SIP amounts (Rs. 10 for equity/hybrid schemes)
- Increased accessibility to Liquid Fund with lower minimum application amount (Rs. 100)
- Enhanced affordability for small investors using digital platforms

**Negative Impacts:**
- Investors unable to make fresh investments in three international equity schemes
- No new systematic investment plans allowed for suspended international funds
- Potential signal of capacity constraints or portfolio rebalancing in international schemes

**Market Implications:**
- Suspension suggests possible fund size management or regulatory considerations for international equity schemes
- Reduced minimums may increase retail participation in domestic equity and liquid fund schemes
- Existing investors in suspended schemes unaffected; redemptions and switches-out likely still permitted

**Operational Impact:**
- Limited to Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund schemes
- Does not affect other mutual fund houses
- Changes applicable through BSE StAR MF platform and digital channels
