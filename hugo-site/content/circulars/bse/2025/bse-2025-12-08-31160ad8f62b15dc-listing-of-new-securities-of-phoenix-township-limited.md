## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market impact as it involves a relatively small quantity of shares (5.7 lakh) issued on preferential basis to non-promoters. The 18-month lock-in period (from allotment to June 30, 2026) ensures these shares will not immediately affect market liquidity. The issuance represents capital raising through warrant conversion, which is a routine corporate action for Phoenix Township Limited. Trading members are simply notified to update their systems for the new distinctive numbers and ISIN.
