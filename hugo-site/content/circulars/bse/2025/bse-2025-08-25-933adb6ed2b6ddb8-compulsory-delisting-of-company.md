## Summary

BSE announces the compulsory delisting of Asahi Infrastructure & Projects Ltd (Scrip Code: 512535) effective August 27, 2025, following suspension for more than 6 months. The delisting is ordered by BSE's Delisting Committee under SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2021.

## Key Points

- Asahi Infrastructure & Projects Ltd (512535) to be compulsorily delisted from August 27, 2025
- Company suspended for more than 6 months prior to delisting decision
- Delisting ordered under SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2021
- Securities will cease trading on BSE platform
- Company will be moved to BSE's Dissemination Board

## Regulatory Changes

- 10-year market access ban for company, whole-time directors, compliance officers, promoters and promoted companies
- Transfer restrictions on promoter shares (sale, pledge, etc.)
- Freezing of corporate benefits (dividend, rights, bonus shares) for promoter holdings
- Promoters and directors barred from becoming directors of listed companies until exit option provided

## Compliance Requirements

- Promoters must purchase public shareholder shares at fair value determined by exchange-appointed independent valuer
- Exit option must be provided to public shareholders as per Regulation 33(4)
- Depositories must not effect transfers of promoter/promoter group shares
- Public notice regarding fair value determination to be issued

## Important Dates

- **August 27, 2025**: Effective date of compulsory delisting
- **10 years from delisting**: Duration of market access ban for affected parties

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact**: Shareholders lose trading liquidity immediately. Promoters face severe restrictions including 10-year market ban and mandatory buyback obligations at fair value. The delisting sets precedent for suspended companies and reinforces SEBI's enforcement of listing compliance standards.
