---

## Summary

BSE has assigned a new ISIN number INE281E01028 to MINI DIAMONDS INDIA LTD (Scrip Code: 523373) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs. 10/- to Re. 2/-. This new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date of December 2, 2025. This notice is issued in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251118-57 dated November 18, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN Number: INE281E01028
- Company: MINI DIAMONDS INDIA LTD
- Scrip Code: 523373
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Old Face Value: Rs. 10/- per share
- New Face Value: Re. 2/- per share
- Split Ratio: 1:5 (one share of Rs. 10 becomes five shares of Re. 2)
- DR Number: 768/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action where the company has subdivided its equity shares, requiring issuance of a new ISIN number for the subdivided shares with lower face value.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must note the new ISIN number and ensure systems are updated for trades from ex-date
- **Depositories**: Will activate the new ISIN for demat holdings from ex-date
- **Investors**: No action required - existing holdings will automatically reflect subdivided shares in demat accounts
- **Company**: Must ensure all records reflect the new share structure and ISIN

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 27, 2025 (actual notice dated November 19, 2025)
- **Ex-Date**: December 2, 2025 - New ISIN becomes effective for all trades
- **Reference Notice**: November 18, 2025 (Notice No. 20251118-57)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the per-share price proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market infrastructure must ensure their systems recognize the new ISIN from the ex-date. Existing shareholders will see their holdings automatically adjusted in demat accounts (1 old share = 5 new shares).

**Investor Impact**: Positive for retail participation as lower face value and reduced market price per share improves affordability and trading flexibility. Total investment value remains unchanged due to proportional adjustment.
