## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must inform all clients about commencement of REs trading, mentioning the ISIN INE945F20017
- Trading Members must clarify that REs should not be mistaken for ordinary shares
- Contract notes/bills for RE purchases must prominently include disclaimer explaining that:

  - Participation requires application with requisite application money or renunciation before issue closes
  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced by Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished
- Trading Members must refer to notice no. 20200305-21 and notice no. 20200518-34 for additional details

## Important Dates

- **December 17, 2025**: Rights Entitlements trading begins; Rights Issue opens
- **December 22, 2025**: Last day for Rights Entitlements trading/renunciation
- **December 26, 2025**: Rights Issue closes
- **Post December 26, 2025**: Unsubscribed/unrenounced REs will lapse and be extinguished

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects existing shareholders of Deccan Gold Mines Limited who hold rights entitlements. The 6-day renunciation trading window (December 17-22) provides opportunity for shareholders to trade their rights before the issue closes on December 26.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure proper client communication regarding the nature of REs, settlement procedures, and consequences of non-action. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis requires appropriate risk management and client education to prevent confusion with ordinary equity shares.
