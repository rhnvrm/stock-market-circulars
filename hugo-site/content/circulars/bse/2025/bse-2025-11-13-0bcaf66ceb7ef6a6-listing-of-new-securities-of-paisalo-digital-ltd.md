## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine corporate action involving conversion of pre-existing FCCBs into equity shares. The conversion was completed in September 2025, and this circular merely formalizes the listing on BSE.

**Dilution Impact**: The addition of 74.03 lakh shares represents incremental dilution to existing shareholders. The actual impact depends on the existing share capital, but FCCB conversions are typically anticipated by the market.

**Trading Impact**: Minimal immediate trading impact expected as the conversion was completed two months prior to listing. The shares rank equally with existing shares and carry full rights from the allotment date.
