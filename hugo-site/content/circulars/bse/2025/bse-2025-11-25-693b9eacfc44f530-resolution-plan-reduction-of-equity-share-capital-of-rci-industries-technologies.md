## Summary

BSE has announced that RCI Industries & Technologies Limited (Scrip Code: 537254) will undergo a reduction of equity share capital as per a Resolution Plan approved by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), New Delhi Bench. The record date is set for November 28, 2025, and trading in the company's equity shares will be suspended from the same date. The plan involves complete extinguishment of promoter shareholding and reduction of public shareholding to only 5% of the fully diluted capital structure.

## Key Points

- Record date for capital reduction: November 28, 2025

- Complete cancellation and extinguishment of all promoter and promoter group shareholding
- Existing public shareholding to be reduced to only 5% of post-implementation fully diluted capital
- Resolution Plan approved by NCLT, New Delhi Bench
- Company equity shares currently under GSM (Graded Surveillance Measure) restriction
- Notice issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

This action is being implemented under a court-approved Resolution Plan by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), New Delhi Bench. The plan authorizes:

1. **Extinguishment of Promoter Shareholding**: Complete cancellation and extinguishment of the entire issued, subscribed and paid-up equity share capital held by promoters and promoter group

2. **Reduction of Public Shareholding**: Cancellation and extinguishment of existing public shareholding, with only 5% of the fully diluted capital structure to be retained by existing public shareholders post-implementation

## Compliance Requirements
