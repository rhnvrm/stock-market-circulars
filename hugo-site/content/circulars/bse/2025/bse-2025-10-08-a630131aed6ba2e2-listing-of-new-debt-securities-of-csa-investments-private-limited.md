## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a small private placement (Rs. 5 crore) with limited liquidity given the high face value (Rs. 1 lakh per unit) and CARE B rating, which indicates higher credit risk.

**Investor Relevance:** Relevant only to institutional investors and high net-worth individuals interested in high-yield debt instruments with monthly income streams. The CARE B rating suggests this is suitable only for risk-tolerant investors.

**Trading Implications:** Given the market lot of 1 unit and face value of Rs. 1 lakh, this security targets institutional participants rather than retail investors.
