## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to operate with staged surveillance measures (5/15/30 days). Securities under this framework face enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions based on price volatility and unusual trading patterns. The framework serves as a preventive measure to protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the new securities under ST-ASM surveillance
- Enhanced due diligence required for trades in affected securities
- Clients should be informed about surveillance status of these securities
- Members must comply with any additional margin or trading restrictions imposed under ASM framework

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 31, 2025 - Changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 17 securities to ST-ASM framework will result in enhanced surveillance and potentially stricter trading conditions including higher margins, reduced position limits, or trade-for-trade settlement. This affects retail and institutional investors holding or trading these securities. Securities exiting the framework (9 stocks) will see relaxed surveillance, though some are moving to other restrictive frameworks like LT-ASM. Overall market impact is moderate, affecting specific scrips rather than broad market operations.
