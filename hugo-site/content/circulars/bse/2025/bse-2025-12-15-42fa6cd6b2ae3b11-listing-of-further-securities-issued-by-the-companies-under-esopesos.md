## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a routine listing notification for shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must ensure proper disclosure of ESOP/ESOS allotments
- Lock-in requirements apply to all listed shares as indicated
- Standard listing compliance procedures to be followed by issuing companies

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: December 15, 2025
- Listing effective immediately upon publication

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine administrative listing of employee stock options that have been exercised and converted to equity shares. The lock-in status indicates these shares are subject to holding period restrictions and will not immediately affect market liquidity. The relatively small quantities involved suggest no material impact on trading volumes or stock prices.
