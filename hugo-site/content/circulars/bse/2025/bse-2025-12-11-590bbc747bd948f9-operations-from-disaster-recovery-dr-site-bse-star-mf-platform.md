## Compliance Requirements

- Members must plan their BSE StAR MF platform activities to avoid the specified downtime windows
- Members should ensure alternative arrangements for critical mutual fund transactions during the switching periods
- No specific compliance actions required beyond operational awareness

## Important Dates

- **December 13, 2025**: DR site operations day
  - 8:30 AM - 9:30 AM: Primary to DR environment switch (platform unavailable)
  - 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM: DR site operations window
  - 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM: DR to Primary environment switch (platform unavailable)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - The BSE StAR MF platform will have limited availability during specific time windows on a Saturday, which typically sees lower trading volumes. The two one-hour switching windows (8:30-9:30 AM and 11:30 AM-12:30 PM) will result in complete platform unavailability.

**Market Impact**: Low to Medium - Since the activity is scheduled for a Saturday and affects only the mutual fund platform, the overall market impact is limited. However, members conducting mutual fund transactions during these hours will need to plan accordingly.

**Member Impact**: Members actively using the BSE StAR MF platform on Saturday morning will need to adjust their operational schedules to accommodate the downtime windows. The advance notice allows for adequate planning.
