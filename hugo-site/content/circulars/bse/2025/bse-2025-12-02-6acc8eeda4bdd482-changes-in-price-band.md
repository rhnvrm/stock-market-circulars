- All trades in affected securities must be within the specified price band limits
- Trading systems should be updated to reflect new price band restrictions
- For clarifications, members should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 2, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 3, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements for the 11 affected securities. Securities with 2% bands (Milestone Furniture, Permanent Magnets, Shikhar Consultants) face the most restrictive trading environment, while Haryana Capfin with a 20% band has the most flexibility.

**Trading Impact**: Investors and traders in these securities will experience limited price discovery and reduced volatility. This may affect liquidity and trading strategies for these stocks.

**Investor Protection**: The price band mechanism serves as a circuit breaker to prevent sharp price movements and potential market manipulation, protecting retail investors from extreme volatility.

**Surveillance Context**: These price band revisions indicate that BSE surveillance has identified concerns with these securities warranting enhanced monitoring and trading restrictions.
