- **December 01, 2025**: NFO opens

- **December 03, 2025, 6:00 PM**: Deadline for clear funds in ICCL Account

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine NFO launch for a gold ETF product. It provides investors with an additional passive investment option in the gold category through Bandhan Mutual Fund.

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium for participating members - Members need to ensure compliance with specific fund settlement timelines and manage client transaction processing within prescribed deadlines. The extended trading hours until midnight provides additional flexibility for lumpsum investments.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for investors seeking gold exposure through ETF route. The availability of both regular and direct plans provides choice based on investor preference. The tight fund settlement requirements (clear funds by 6:00 PM on December 03, 2025) require investors to plan their investments accordingly to ensure allotment.
