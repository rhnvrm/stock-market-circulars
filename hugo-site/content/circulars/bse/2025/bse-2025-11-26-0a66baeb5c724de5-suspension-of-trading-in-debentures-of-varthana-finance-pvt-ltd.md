## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in debentures of Varthana Finance Pvt Ltd effective November 27, 2025. The company has informed the exchange about the early redemption of its 11.65% debentures maturing on September 16, 2026 (ISIN: INE125T07295, Scrip Code: 976016). Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the effective date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension effective from November 27, 2025
- Debenture series: VFPL-11.65%-16-9-26-PVT
- ISIN: INE125T07295
- Scrip Code: 976016
- Reason: Early redemption by the issuer
- Notice Reference: DR-765/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard suspension due to early redemption of debt securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the specified debentures from November 27, 2025
- Trading members are required to take note of this suspension
- All market participants must comply with the trading restriction

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 26, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 27, 2025
- **Original Maturity Date**: September 16, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of Varthana Finance Pvt Ltd's specific debenture series. The early redemption suggests the company is prepaying its debt obligations, which may be positive for the issuer's financial management but removes a trading instrument from the debt market. Debenture holders will receive early redemption proceeds as per the terms of the instrument. No broader market implications expected as this affects a single private limited company's debt instrument.
