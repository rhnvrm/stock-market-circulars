## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction involves 99 securities, indicating delivery failures across multiple scrips. While most quantities are small (1-100 shares), several scrips have significant quantities that could impact short-term pricing during the auction process.

**Operational Impact:** The presence of liquid large-cap stocks (HDFC Bank, Infosys, TCS, SBI) alongside smaller companies suggests delivery failures occurred across the market spectrum. Members involved will face additional costs due to auction prices typically being at a premium to market prices.

**Broker Impact:** Brokers whose clients failed to deliver must arrange for securities through auction, potentially affecting client relationships and involving financial penalties as per exchange norms.
