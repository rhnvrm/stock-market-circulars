title: Revision of Price Bands for 30 Securities Effective December 8, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced revisions to price bands for 30 securities, effective from December 8, 2025. The revised bands range from 5% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive), replacing the previous levels. This action is part of BSE's surveillance measures to regulate trading volatility in these securities.

## Key Points

- 30 securities will have revised price bands effective December 8, 2025
- Price bands being implemented: 5%, 10%, and 20%
- 16 securities assigned the most restrictive 5% band
- 10 securities assigned 10% price band
- 4 securities assigned 20% price band
- Trading members notified through Notice No. 20251205-50
- Clarifications available at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

BSE Surveillance Department has modified price band parameters for the listed securities. Price bands are regulatory tools that limit the maximum price movement (both upward and downward) allowed for a security during a trading session. The changes reflect enhanced surveillance measures for securities exhibiting unusual trading patterns or volatility concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure their systems are updated to reflect the new price bands before December 8, 2025
- All trades in these securities must adhere to the revised price bands from the effective date
- Members should communicate these changes to their clients trading in the affected securities
- Any clarifications required should be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 5, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 8, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The revision of price bands will directly impact trading activity in these 30 securities:

**High Impact (5% band)**: 16 securities including Amit Securities, Cubical Financial Services, Hamps Bio, Jainco Projects, and others will face the most restrictive trading limits, significantly reducing intraday volatility and potentially affecting liquidity.

**Moderate Impact (10% band)**: 10 securities including Gorani Industries, Jay Kailash Namkeen, Kaushalya Infrastructure, and others will have moderate trading restrictions.

**Lower Impact (20% band)**: 4 securities (Aryaman Financial Services, Gujarat Apollo Industries, Shankar Lal Rampal Dye-Chem) will have wider trading bands, allowing more price discovery.

The tighter price bands suggest heightened surveillance concerns for the majority of affected securities. Investors and traders should expect reduced volatility but potentially lower liquidity in these scrips.
