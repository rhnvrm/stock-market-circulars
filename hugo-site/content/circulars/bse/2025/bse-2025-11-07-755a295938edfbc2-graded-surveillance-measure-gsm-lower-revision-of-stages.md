title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Lower Revision of Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the downward revision of Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages for 56 securities. These securities are being moved to lower surveillance stages, indicating improved compliance or reduced risk concerns. The revisions affect securities across multiple groups including X, Z, XT, M, MS, P, T, and B, with stage reductions ranging from Stage 4 to Stage 3, Stage 3 to Stage 2, Stage 2 to Stage 1, and Stage 1 to Stage 0.

## Key Points

- 56 securities have been granted lower GSM surveillance stages
- Stage reductions indicate improved market behavior and compliance
- Affected securities span multiple trading groups (X, Z, XT, M, MS, P, T, B)
- Revisions include movements from Stage 4→3, Stage 3→2, Stage 2→1, and Stage 1→0
- Lower stages generally mean reduced trading restrictions and enhanced liquidity
- Securities include companies from diverse sectors including textiles, IT, chemicals, finance, and manufacturing

## Regulatory Changes

The downward revision of GSM stages reflects the exchange's periodic review mechanism for securities under surveillance. Lower stages typically result in:

- Reduced additional surveillance deposit (ASD) requirements
- Relaxed price bands or trading restrictions
- Improved market accessibility for investors
- Enhanced liquidity due to fewer trading constraints

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance actions are required from market participants. However:

- Trading members should update their risk management systems to reflect the new GSM stages
- Investors may experience improved trading conditions for these securities
- Reduced margin requirements may apply depending on the stage revision

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: November 7, 2025
- Effective Date: As specified by the exchange (typically immediate or next trading day)

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact:**
- Enhanced liquidity for the 56 affected securities
- Lower transaction costs due to reduced surveillance charges
- Improved investor confidence in these securities
- Easier position-taking for traders and investors

**Market Significance:**
- Demonstrates the exchange's dynamic surveillance framework
- Rewards improved corporate governance and market behavior
- Stage 0 removals (5 securities) indicate complete exit from GSM framework
- Particularly significant for securities moving from Stage 4 (highest surveillance) to Stage 3

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members need to update margin and risk parameters
- Reduced monitoring requirements for compliance teams
- Potential increase in trading volumes for affected securities
