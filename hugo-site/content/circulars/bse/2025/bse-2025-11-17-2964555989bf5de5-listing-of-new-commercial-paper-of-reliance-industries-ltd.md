## Impact Assessment

This is a routine short-term debt market operation with minimal market impact. Reliance Industries Ltd has raised Rs. 1,300 crores through these commercial paper issuances for working capital requirements. The high credit ratings (A1+) reflect the issuer's strong creditworthiness. The short maturity period (37-42 days) indicates these are standard treasury operations. Impact is limited to debt market participants and does not affect equity markets or broader market operations.
