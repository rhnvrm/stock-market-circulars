  of Funds

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited has announced changes to the names of two US Treasury Bond ETFs Fund of Funds schemes, effective December 29, 2025. The name changes are in compliance with SEBI's Framework for launching Fund of Fund (FOF) schemes with multiple underlying funds. All other features, terms, and conditions of the schemes remain unchanged.

## Key Points

- Two schemes will undergo name changes: US Treasury 1-3 Year Bond ETFs and US Treasury 3-10 Year Bond ETFs Fund of Funds
- Name changes follow SEBI Letter no. SEBI/HO/IMD/IMD-RAC-1/P/OW/2025/4102/1 dated February 6, 2025 and revised framework dated June 30, 2025
- Changes are administrative only - all scheme features and terms remain the same
- Relevant amendments will be made to the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)
- This notice-cum-addendum (Addendum No. 55/2025) forms integral part of SID and KIM

## Regulatory Changes

The name changes comply with SEBI's Framework for launching Fund of Fund (FOF) schemes with multiple underlying funds. The new naming convention includes "Passive FOF" designation instead of "Fund of Funds" to better reflect the nature of these schemes.

**Scheme Name Changes:**

1. **Aditya Birla Sun Life US Treasury 1-3 Year Bond ETFs Fund of Funds** → **Aditya Birla Sun Life US Treasury 1-3 Year Bonds ETFs Passive FOF**

2. **Aditya Birla Sun Life US Treasury 3-10 Year Bond ETFs Fund of Funds** → **Aditya Birla Sun Life US Treasury 3-10 Year Bonds ETFs Passive FOF**

## Compliance Requirements

- Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited will update the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) to reflect the new scheme names
- Investors should note the new scheme names for future reference and documentation
- No action required from existing investors as this is an administrative change

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 24, 2025
- **Circular Publication Date:** December 26, 2025
- **Effective Date of Name Change:** December 29, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal - This is a nomenclature change only with no impact on market operations.

**Investor Impact:** No material impact on investors. The change is purely administrative to align with SEBI's FOF framework. Investment objectives, portfolio composition, risk profile, and all other scheme parameters remain unchanged.

**Operational Impact:** Administrative updates required to scheme documentation (SID and KIM) and platform listings. The circular specifically relates to BSE StAR MF Platform where these scheme names will be updated.
