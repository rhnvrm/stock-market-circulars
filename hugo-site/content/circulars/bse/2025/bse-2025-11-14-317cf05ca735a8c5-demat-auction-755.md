## Summary

BSE has published the list of securities to be auctioned in Demat Auction Settlement No. 755 dated November 14, 2025. The circular contains details of 110 scrips across various sectors that will be auctioned due to delivery shortages or failures. Quantities range from 1 share to 10,000 shares depending on the scrip.

## Key Points

- Settlement Number: 755
- Settlement Date: November 14, 2025
- Total number of scrips: 110
- Auction covers diverse sectors including IT, pharmaceuticals, infrastructure, banking, metals, and mutual funds
- Notable large quantity auctions include Hindware Home (10,000 shares), Tata Mutual (1,300 shares), SEPC Limited (1,100 shares), and ASHIMA LTD (1,000 shares)
- Several major stocks included such as Reliance Industries (234 shares), Hindustan Zinc (100 shares), IOC (200 shares), and HDFC Bank (2 shares)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced in this circular. This is a standard operational notice for demat auction settlement.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members who have failed to deliver securities must participate in the auction or arrange delivery
- Buying members must be prepared to purchase auctioned securities at prevailing auction prices
- All transactions must be settled as per BSE auction settlement procedures
- Members must ensure adequate funds/securities for auction settlement

## Important Dates

- **Settlement Date:** November 14, 2025
- **Auction Date:** To be conducted as per BSE auction calendar for Settlement No. 755

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction involves 110 different scrips with varying quantities. While individual quantities are relatively small for most stocks, the breadth of securities affected is significant.

**Operational Impact:** Sellers who failed to deliver will face auction losses if auction prices are higher than settlement prices. Buyers awaiting delivery will receive securities through the auction process. The large number of scrips indicates systemic delivery issues across multiple trading members.

**Price Impact:** Stocks with larger auction quantities (Hindware Home, Tata Mutual, SEPC, Kanani Industries with 2,527 shares) may experience temporary price volatility during auction execution. Most other stocks have minimal quantities unlikely to significantly impact market prices.
