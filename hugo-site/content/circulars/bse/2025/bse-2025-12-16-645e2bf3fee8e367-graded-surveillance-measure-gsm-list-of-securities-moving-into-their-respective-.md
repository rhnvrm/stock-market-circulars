title: GSM Framework - 35 Securities Moving to Higher Surveillance Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of 35 securities into various stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. The securities are being moved to GSM Stages I through IV, with 2 securities moving to Stage I, 2 to Stage II, 3 to Stage III, and 28 to Stage IV. The GSM framework is designed to enhance market surveillance and investor protection by imposing additional monitoring and trading restrictions on securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or other concerns.

## Key Points

- 2 securities moving to GSM Stage I: Amit International Ltd, others
- 2 securities moving to GSM Stage II: KLG Capital Services Ltd, Swadha Nature Ltd
- 3 securities moving to GSM Stage III: N2N Technologies Ltd, Sarda Proteins Ltd, Advik Laboratories Ltd
- 28 securities moving to GSM Stage IV: Including Rama Petrochemicals Ltd, Mipco Seamless Rings Gujarat Ltd, Premium Capital Market & Investments Ltd, and 25 others
- Securities may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure) or IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) frameworks
- One security (Univa Foods Ltd) marked as per NSE classification

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework applies progressive surveillance measures across four stages:
- **Stage I**: Initial surveillance with 100% margin requirement
- **Stage II**: Enhanced surveillance with additional restrictions
- **Stage III**: Further tightened surveillance measures
- **Stage IV**: Highest level of surveillance with strictest trading restrictions including additional surveillance deposit (ASD), reduced price bands, and periodic call auctions

Securities can move between stages based on their trading behavior and compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable margin requirements for securities in respective GSM stages
- Stage IV securities require additional surveillance deposit and face trade-for-trade settlement
- Investors should exercise caution while trading in GSM securities and understand the associated risks
- Brokers must inform clients about GSM classification and associated restrictions
- Position limits and exposure limits apply as per GSM stage requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 16, 2025 (date of circular issuance)
- Securities will be subject to GSM provisions from the effective date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The movement of 35 securities, particularly 28 into Stage IV, indicates significant surveillance concerns. Stage IV restrictions severely limit liquidity and increase transaction costs through higher margins and trading restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these securities will face:
- Reduced liquidity due to stricter trading norms
- Higher margin requirements (up to 100% in cash)
- Limited ability to take fresh positions
- Potential difficulty in exiting positions

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to reflect new GSM classifications, implement margin collection mechanisms, and ensure client communication about increased risks and restrictions.
