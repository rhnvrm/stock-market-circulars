## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - affects only JAINEX AAMCOL LIMITED shareholders and interested investors.

**Operational Impact**: Medium for trading members handling JAINEX clients - must ensure proper client communication, contract note disclaimers, and awareness of short 4-day RE trading window.

**Investor Impact**: High for JAINEX shareholders - must act within tight timeframe (December 01-09) to either subscribe, renounce REs, or risk lapsing of entitlements. The 4-day renunciation window (December 01-04) is particularly critical for those wishing to sell their rights.
