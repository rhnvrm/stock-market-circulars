---

## Summary

BSE has announced that pursuant to an order issued by the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), the delisting of Noble Polymers Limited (Scrip Code: 539200) has been rescinded. The company's status will be changed from "Delisted" to "Suspended" with effect from November 13, 2025. As a consequence of this status change, the provisions of Regulation 24(1) and Regulation 24(2) of SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 will no longer be applicable to the company.

## Key Points

- Noble Polymers Limited (Scrip Code: 539200) delisting has been rescinded by SAT order
- Company status will change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"
- SEBI Delisting Regulations provisions 24(1) and 24(2) will not apply to the company
- Notice issued by Netra Sahani (Deputy Vice President, Listing Compliance) and Manish Raval (Manager, Listing Compliance)

## Regulatory Changes

The Securities Appellate Tribunal has issued an order rescinding the delisting of Noble Polymers Limited. Following this order, the company will no longer be subject to Regulation 24(1) and Regulation 24(2) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009. These regulations typically govern post-delisting obligations and procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements are outlined in this circular. The notice is informational in nature, notifying market participants of the change in company status from "Delisted" to "Suspended" as mandated by the SAT order.

## Important Dates

- **November 11, 2025**: Notice date
- **November 13, 2025**: Effective date for status change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The rescission of delisting is a significant development for Noble Polymers Limited shareholders. While the company will not resume trading immediately (status is "Suspended" rather than "Active"), this represents a reversal of the delisting decision and may provide shareholders with potential future opportunities.

**Regulatory Impact**: The SAT order overturns the previous delisting decision, demonstrating the appellate authority's oversight role. The exemption from SEBI Delisting Regulations 24(1) and 24(2) indicates that the company is no longer subject to post-delisting compliance requirements.

**Stakeholder Impact**: Existing shareholders of Noble Polymers Limited are directly affected, as the company's securities are no longer in delisted status. However, with "Suspended" status, trading remains halted pending further regulatory or compliance actions.
