## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a company-specific listing event involving preferential allotment to non-promoters through warrant conversion. The total number of shares (27.69 lakhs) represents additional equity capital for Venmax Drugs And Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Trading members can trade these securities from December 30, 2025, subject to lock-in restrictions until July 13, 2026. The staggered allotment across three dates in August-September 2025 suggests phased warrant conversion.

**Shareholder Impact**: Moderate dilution for existing shareholders. The preferential allotment to non-promoters increases the public shareholding of the company.
