## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular provides standardized reference data in a consistent file format for operational use by clearing members and participants.

## Compliance Requirements

- Clearing members must use the standardized file format for collateral management
- Members must adhere to specified permitted quantities for each security
- Mandatory application of prescribed haircuts (minimum 9% or VaR-based 6σ, whichever is higher)
- Collateral pledging must respect overall permitted quantity limits across all segments

## Important Dates

- **Applicable Month**: December 2025 (2025-12-01)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Provides essential reference data for collateral management and risk mitigation across BSE segments. Clearing members and trading participants need to update their systems with the standardized format and current permitted quantities.

**Market Impact**: Low - Does not affect trading operations directly. This is an informational circular for back-office and risk management functions.

**Risk Management**: The standardized haircut methodology (higher of 9% or VaR-based 6σ) ensures consistent risk coverage across different securities while accounting for volatility differences. The specified permitted quantities help manage concentration risk in the collateral pool.
