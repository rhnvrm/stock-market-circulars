title: Cancellation of Trading Suspension for Dharan Infra-EPC Ltd and Northlink Fiscal
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a notice cancelling the trading suspension for two companies - Dharan Infra-EPC Ltd (Scrip Code: 541161) and Northlink Fiscal and Capital Services Ltd (Scrip Code: 539110) - effective December 15, 2025. This follows the companies' compliance with provisions of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, after being previously suspended via Exchange Notice No. 20251112-40 dated November 12, 2025.

## Key Points

- Two companies will have their trading suspension cancelled effective December 15, 2025
- Dharan Infra-EPC Ltd (Scrip Code: 541161)
- Northlink Fiscal and Capital Services Ltd (Scrip Code: 539110)
- Suspension was originally imposed for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations
- Companies have now rectified their non-compliances
- All other provisions of the original suspension notice (20251112-40 dated November 12, 2025) remain unchanged for other suspended entities

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular represents enforcement action reversal following compliance rectification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note that normal trading will resume for these two securities from December 15, 2025
- No specific action required from market participants beyond awareness of trading resumption
- Companies have already fulfilled their compliance obligations to qualify for suspension cancellation

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 11, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 15, 2025 (trading suspension cancellation becomes effective)
- **Reference Notice:** November 12, 2025 (original suspension notice)

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact for Affected Companies:** Resumption of trading allows shareholders to trade their holdings and restores market liquidity for these securities.

**Limited Broader Market Impact:** This affects only two specific scrips with relatively small market presence. The cancellation demonstrates the exchange's compliance monitoring effectiveness and provides incentive for other suspended companies to rectify their non-compliances.

**Investor Consideration:** Investors should review the companies' compliance history and fundamental health before trading, as the suspension cancellation only indicates regulatory compliance restoration, not necessarily improved business performance.
