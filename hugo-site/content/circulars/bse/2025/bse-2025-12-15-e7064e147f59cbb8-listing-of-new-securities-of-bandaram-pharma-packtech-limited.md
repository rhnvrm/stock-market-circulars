## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to a single company's preferential allotment.

The issuance to promoters and non-promoters on preferential basis is a standard capital raising mechanism. Trading members should be aware of the lock-in restrictions when processing orders for this scrip.
