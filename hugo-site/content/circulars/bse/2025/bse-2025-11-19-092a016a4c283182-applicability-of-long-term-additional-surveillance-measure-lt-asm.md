Ten securities have been newly shortlisted into the LT-ASM framework, one security (Priya Ltd) will be moved to a higher ASM Stage II while continuing in LT-ASM, and one security (Asarfi Hospital Ltd) will exit the framework due to inclusion in the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework.

## Regulatory Framework

The Long Term ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or unusual trading patterns over an extended period. Securities under this framework are subject to:

- Enhanced disclosure requirements
- Additional margin requirements
- Position limits for traders
- Graded surveillance stages (I through IV) with progressively stringent measures

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with enhanced margin requirements for affected securities
- Investors should be aware of position limits and trading restrictions
- Market participants must adhere to the specific conditions applicable to each ASM stage
- All trades in LT-ASM securities subject to additional surveillance parameters

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 20, 2025
- **Circular Date**: November 19, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The inclusion of 10 securities in LT-ASM and upgrade of 1 security to higher stage will result in increased trading costs through higher margins and reduced liquidity due to position limits. This may lead to lower trading volumes in affected securities.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will face higher margin requirements and potential position restrictions, affecting their ability to take large positions or conduct short-term trading strategies.

**Risk Mitigation**: The framework serves as a cautionary measure to protect investors from securities with abnormal price patterns, potentially preventing losses from excessive speculation or manipulation attempts.
