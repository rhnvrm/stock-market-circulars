## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 5 securities to ESM Stage I and movement of 2 securities to higher stages will result in increased trading restrictions and margin requirements for these specific stocks. Liquidity in these securities may be reduced due to trade-for-trade settlement requirements.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will face:
- Higher margin requirements
- Inability to square off positions intraday
- Potential price volatility due to enhanced surveillance
- Additional compliance and settlement obligations

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members must update their risk management systems to reflect new ESM classifications and ensure appropriate margins are collected from clients trading these securities.
