With 88.96% of the offer size (88,33,852 out of 99,27,438 shares) participating in the reverse book building, there is substantial interest from shareholders to exit at Rs. 65 per share, representing a 4.52% premium over the floor price of Rs. 62.19.

**Market Liquidity**: Upon successful completion of delisting, the equity shares will cease trading on The Calcutta Stock Exchange, eliminating market liquidity for remaining shareholders who did not participate.

**Promoter Control**: The promoters will consolidate their shareholding by acquiring up to 31.41% additional equity from public shareholders, significantly increasing their control over the company.

**Price Discovery**: The discovered price of Rs. 65 per share, matching the indicative offer price with no bids above it, suggests shareholders found this price acceptable for their exit. The 28 successful bids indicate concentrated shareholding among public shareholders.
