## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing with minimal market impact. The shares were issued to promoters only through conversion of compulsorily convertible debentures, indicating a structured capital reorganization. The lock-in period until May 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure. The preferential allotment represents an expansion of the company's equity base, but the promoter-only nature limits broader market participation. Trading members should note the lock-in restrictions when handling these securities.
