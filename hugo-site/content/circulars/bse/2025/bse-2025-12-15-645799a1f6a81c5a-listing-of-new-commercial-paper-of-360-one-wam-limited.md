This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it is a routine commercial paper issuance on private placement basis. The impact is limited to:

- **Debt Market Participants**: Provides a new short-term debt instrument (88-day tenor) with high credit rating for investment
- **360 ONE WAM LIMITED**: Enhances liquidity and provides working capital funding at competitive rates
