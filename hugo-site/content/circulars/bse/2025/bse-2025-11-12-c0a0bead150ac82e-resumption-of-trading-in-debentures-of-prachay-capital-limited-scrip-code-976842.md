The trading resumption follows the expiry of put option periods during which debenture holders did not exercise their early redemption rights.

- The record dates were for payment of interest and early redemption on exercise of put option
- Notice reference: DR-755/2025-2026

## Important Dates

- **November 13, 2025**: Trading resumes in all three debenture series

## Impact Assessment

This notice has minimal market impact as it affects only the debt segment and three specific debenture series of PRACHAY CAPITAL LIMITED. The resumption of trading is routine following the expiry of put option periods. Since debenture holders did not exercise their early redemption rights, the debentures will continue to trade normally. This indicates continued investor confidence in holding the instruments to maturity rather than seeking early redemption.
