## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it relates to a single company's preferential allotment. The shares carry an 18-month lock-in period from the notice date, restricting immediate liquidity. The issuance to non-promoters at a premium indicates capital raising activity. Trading members should note the lock-in restrictions when processing orders for these securities.
