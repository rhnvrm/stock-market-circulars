## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing announcement with minimal market impact. The allotment of 307,800 shares represents a relatively small number compared to typical trading volumes of listed companies. The lock-in periods extending until mid-2026 ensure these shares will not immediately affect market liquidity. This appears to be an ESOP allotment or preferential allotment to key personnel and associates, which is a standard corporate action with no significant implications for broader market operations or trading activity.
