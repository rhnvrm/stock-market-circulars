## Summary

BSE has issued its regular circular on the applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective December 09, 2025. Four securities have been newly shortlisted in the LT-ASM Framework: Aadi Industries Ltd, Axita Cotton Ltd, Bharat Global Developers Ltd, and Mahamaya Lifesciences Ltd. Additionally, Shukra Pharmaceuticals Ltd has been placed directly into Stage IV of the LT-ASM Framework. No securities are moving out of the framework or changing stages (except for the direct Stage IV placement).

## Key Points

- 4 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework effective December 09, 2025
- 1 security (Shukra Pharmaceuticals Ltd) placed directly in Stage IV LT-ASM Framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages within the framework
- No securities moving out of Long Term ASM Framework
- Consolidated list includes 14+ securities currently under various ASM stages

## Regulatory Changes

No changes to the Long Term ASM Framework itself. This is a regular update applying existing surveillance measures to specific securities based on their trading patterns and market behavior.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the surveillance restrictions applicable to listed securities
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in securities under LT-ASM
- Applicable margin and settlement requirements must be followed for ASM securities
- Investors should be informed about the surveillance status of these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 09, 2025 - LT-ASM Framework applicable to newly shortlisted securities

## Impact Assessment

**Newly Affected Securities (Part A - Stage I):**
1. Aadi Industries Ltd (530027, INE563D01013)
2. Axita Cotton Ltd (542285, INE02EZ01022)
3. Bharat Global Developers Ltd (521238, INE893C01032)
4. Mahamaya Lifesciences Ltd (544611, INE0U9D01019)

**Direct Stage IV Placement (Part D):**
1. Shukra Pharmaceuticals Ltd (524632, INE551C01044)

**Trading Impact**: Securities under LT-ASM face stricter surveillance with reduced liquidity, higher margins, and potential price volatility restrictions. Stage IV placement for Shukra Pharmaceuticals indicates the most severe surveillance level, significantly restricting trading activity.

**Market Implications**: The placement suggests heightened regulatory concerns about price manipulation, excessive volatility, or other irregular trading patterns in these securities. Investors should exercise extreme caution when trading these stocks.
