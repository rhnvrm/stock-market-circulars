  Fund Transactions

The notice provides detailed operating instructions, settlement processes, and file structure specifications developed jointly by Stock Exchanges and AMFI in consultation with SEBI to facilitate the transition for stock brokers and clearing members.

## Key Points

- Detailed operating instructions provided in Annexure I
- Settlement process specifications outlined in Annexure II
- Technical file structures detailed in Annexure III
- Instructions developed jointly between Stock Exchanges and AMFI in consultation with SEBI

- References provided to earlier notices dated October 6, 2021, March 15, 2022, March 23, 2022, and March 24, 2022

## Regulatory Changes

This notice reinforces SEBI's regulatory directives issued on:
- October 04, 2021
- March 15, 2022
- March 31, 2022

The primary regulatory change mandates the complete discontinuation of pool account usage for mutual fund unit transactions on stock exchange platforms. This represents a fundamental shift in how mutual fund transactions are settled, requiring direct client-level settlement mechanisms instead of pooled broker accounts.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Stock Brokers and Clearing Members:**

1. Implement systems to facilitate mutual fund transactions without using pool accounts
2. Follow detailed operating instructions as specified in Annexure I
3. Adhere to settlement processes outlined in Annexure II
4. Configure systems according to file structure specifications in Annexure III
5. Ensure all mutual fund transactions on BSE StAR MF Platform comply with new settlement framework
6. Contact BSE support for technical assistance or query resolution

**Documentation Required:**
- Review all three annexures (Operating Instructions, Settlement Process, File Structures)
- Update internal procedures to align with new requirements

## Important Dates

- **Original Notice Date:** March 28, 2022
- **Referenced SEBI Circulars:** October 04, 2021, March 15, 2022, March 31, 2022
- **Current Reminder:** November 21, 2025
- No new implementation deadline specified in this reminder notice

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:**
- Stock brokers and clearing members must maintain separate client-wise settlement accounts instead of pooled arrangements

- Ongoing monitoring required to maintain compliance standards
