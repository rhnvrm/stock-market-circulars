  of Stock Exchanges
---

## Summary

BSE has announced a special mock trading session to test the business continuity mechanism for interoperable segments, as mandated by SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD/P/CIR/2024/167 dated November 28, 2024. During the mock session, BSE will simulate a market outage between 2:15 PM to 2:45 PM, during which NSE will be invoked as an alternative trading venue for BSE exclusive securities in the Equity Segment. This test ensures that market participants have access to an alternative trading platform in case of disruptions.

## Key Points

- BSE and NSE will test business continuity scenario during mock trading session
- Simulated outage at BSE will occur between 2:15 PM to 2:45 PM
- NSE will serve as alternative trading venue for BSE exclusive securities during outage period
- Only applicable BSE exclusive securities will be activated at NSE
- BSE will resume trading operations between 2:45 PM to 3:15 PM
- Members must participate and place orders at both exchanges, especially for BSE exclusive securities
- Feedback to be provided at bsehelp@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

This mock session implements the business continuity mechanism established under SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD/P/CIR/2024/167 dated November 28, 2024, which directed BSE and NSE to establish mechanisms ensuring business continuity for interoperable segments by providing alternative trading venues. The Exchange previously informed members about this mechanism through circular no 20250328-18 dated March 28, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must participate in the mock trading session
- Members should place orders at both BSE and NSE exchanges during the session
- Special attention required for trading BSE exclusive securities during the alternative venue activation period
