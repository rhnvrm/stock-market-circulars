title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities Additions and Updates
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective November 14, 2025. Two securities are being newly added to Stage I ESM: MSR India Ltd (Scrip Code: 508922) and Switching Technologies Gunther Ltd (Scrip Code: 517201). No securities are moving to higher or lower ESM stages, and no securities are exiting the framework. The consolidated list contains 29 securities under various ESM stages.

## Key Points

- 2 new securities shortlisted for ESM Stage I effective November 14, 2025
- MSR India Ltd (ISIN: INE331L01026, Scrip Code: 508922) added to ESM
- Switching Technologies Gunther Ltd (ISIN: INE311D01017, Scrip Code: 517201) added to ESM
- No securities moving to higher ESM stages
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages
- No securities exiting ESM framework
- Consolidated list shows 29 securities under ESM surveillance
- Most securities (27 out of 29) are in Stage I ESM
- 2 securities in Stage II ESM: Aarey Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd and Alan Scott Enterprises Ltd

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework continues to be applied to identify securities with abnormal price movements or trading patterns. Securities under ESM are subject to additional surveillance and trading restrictions to protect investor interests. The framework uses staged approach (Stage I and Stage II) based on severity and persistence of concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and investors should note the ESM status of the listed securities
- Securities under ESM may have additional margin requirements and trading restrictions
- Market participants should exercise caution when trading in ESM securities
- Investors advised to review ESM list before executing trades in affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** November 14, 2025 - New ESM additions and consolidated list becomes applicable

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 2 securities to ESM framework will result in enhanced monitoring and potentially restricted trading conditions for MSR India Ltd and Switching Technologies Gunther Ltd. Investors in these securities may face additional margin requirements and price bands. The measure is designed to protect investors from excessive volatility and unusual price movements. The relatively small number of new additions suggests targeted intervention rather than broad market concerns.
