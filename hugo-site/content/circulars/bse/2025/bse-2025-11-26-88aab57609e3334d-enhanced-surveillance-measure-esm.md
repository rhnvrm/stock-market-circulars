## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective November 27, 2025. One new security, Khandelwal Extractions Ltd (Scrip Code: 519064, ISIN: INE687W01010), has been shortlisted for inclusion in the ESM framework. No securities are moving to higher or lower ESM stages, and no securities are exiting the framework at this time. The consolidated list shows 30 securities currently under ESM, with the majority in Stage I surveillance.

## Key Points

- Khandelwal Extractions Ltd newly added to ESM framework (Stage I)
- No securities being moved to higher ESM stages
- No securities being moved to lower ESM stages
- No securities exiting the ESM framework
- Total of 30 securities remain under ESM surveillance as per consolidated list
- Framework continues to monitor securities based on various risk parameters

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework is designed to alert investors about securities with abnormal price movements or trading patterns. Securities under ESM face additional surveillance and may have specific trading restrictions. The framework operates in multiple stages (I, II, etc.) with increasing levels of scrutiny.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the inclusion of Khandelwal Extractions Ltd in ESM framework
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance status when trading affected securities
- ESM securities may be subject to additional margin requirements and price bands
- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable ESM framework provisions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 27, 2025 - ESM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of one security to ESM framework has limited immediate market-wide impact, though it signals regulatory concern about that specific security's trading patterns.

**Trading Impact**: Khandelwal Extractions Ltd will face enhanced surveillance, which may include additional disclosures, price bands, or trading restrictions depending on ESM stage requirements.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in affected securities should exercise caution and be aware of the reasons for ESM inclusion, which typically relate to price volatility, low market capitalization, or other risk factors.
