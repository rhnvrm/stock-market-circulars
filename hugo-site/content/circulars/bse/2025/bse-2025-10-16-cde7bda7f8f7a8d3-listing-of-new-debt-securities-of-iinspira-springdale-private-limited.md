## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine listing of a small private placement debt security with limited quantity (single unit of Rs. 10 lakh). The B rating indicates higher credit risk, and the 20% interest rate reflects the risk premium. The security is unlikely to have significant trading volume or broader market implications given its private placement nature and small size.
