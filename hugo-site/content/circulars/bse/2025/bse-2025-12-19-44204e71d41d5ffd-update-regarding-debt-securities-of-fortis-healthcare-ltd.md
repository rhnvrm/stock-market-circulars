## Impact Assessment

The conversion from secured to unsecured NCDs represents a material change in the risk profile of these debt instruments. Unsecured NCDs have lower priority in case of liquidation compared to secured NCDs, which may affect investor perception and secondary market pricing. The change affects three distinct ISINs of Fortis Healthcare Ltd debt securities. Investors and trading members should take note of the new ISINs for accurate trading and settlement operations.
