title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective October 24, 2025. Eight securities have been newly shortlisted in the LT-ASM Framework, one security (Sirohia & Sons Ltd) will move to a higher Stage II ASM, and two securities (Krishna Capital and Securities Ltd and Xelpmoc Design and Tech Ltd) are moving out of the framework due to inclusion in ESM Framework.

## Key Points

- 8 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Envair Electrodyne Ltd, Fraser and Company Ltd, Hindustan Appliances Ltd, Lyons Corporate Market Ltd, MM Rubber Company Ltd, Sambhaav Media Ltd, SEL Manufacturing Company Ltd, and Nureca Ltd
- Sirohia & Sons Ltd moves from current stage to Stage II ASM while remaining in LT-ASM Framework
- Krishna Capital and Securities Ltd and Xelpmoc Design and Tech Ltd moving out of LT-ASM Framework due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- No securities moving to lower ASM stages
- No securities shortlisted directly in Stage IV Long Term ASM Framework
- Consolidated list includes multiple securities across different ASM stages starting with 7Seas Entertainment Ltd, A B Infrabuild Ltd, A-1 Ltd, and others

## Regulatory Changes

The LT-ASM Framework is designed to alert investors about securities exhibiting abnormal price movements and protect market integrity. Securities under this framework face additional surveillance measures including price bands, trade-for-trade settlement, and enhanced disclosure requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised ASM classifications effective October 24, 2025
- Trading members should inform clients about the ASM status of affected securities
- Investors must be aware of enhanced surveillance measures applicable to these securities
- Securities moving to higher stages may face stricter price bands and trading restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 24, 2025 - All LT-ASM Framework changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of 8 new securities in the LT-ASM Framework will subject them to enhanced surveillance measures, potentially reducing speculative trading activity and volatility. The movement of Sirohia & Sons Ltd to Stage II indicates continued concerns requiring stricter monitoring. The exit of 2 securities to ESM Framework suggests these require even more stringent surveillance measures. Market participants trading these securities should expect reduced liquidity and stricter trading conditions.
