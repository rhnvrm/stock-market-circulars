## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The issuance represents a relatively small number of shares (35,000) and is subject to a lock-in period until April 30, 2026, meaning these shares will not be available for trading in the immediate term.

**Company Impact**: The preferential allotment to non-promoters through warrant conversion provides capital infusion to Global Offshore Services Ltd at Rs. 92/- per share, generating approximately Rs. 32.2 lakhs.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should be aware of the dilution effect, though the impact is minimal given the small size of the issuance. The lock-in period provides some assurance that these shares will not immediately flood the market.
