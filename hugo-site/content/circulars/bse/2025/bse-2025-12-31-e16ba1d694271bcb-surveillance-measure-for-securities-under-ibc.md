title: Surveillance Measure for Securities Under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), effective January 01, 2026. Five securities have been moved to Stage 0 (Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure), and one security (Indosolar Ltd) has been excluded from the ASM framework. No securities were shortlisted for Stage 1 or moved between Stage 1 and Stage 2 during this update.

## Key Points

- Five securities moved to IBC Stage 0: A.F. Enterprises Ltd, East India Drums and Barrels Manufacturing Ltd, Seya Industries Ltd, Swan Defence And Heavy Industries Ltd, and Tricom Fruit Products Ltd
- One security excluded from ASM-IBC framework: Indosolar Ltd (Scrip Code: 533257, ISIN: INE866K01023)
- No new securities added to Stage 1 (IRP commencement)
- No movements between Stage 1 and Stage 2
- Consolidated list includes securities across different IBC stages with special markers for T+0 scrips, NSE alignment, and recommencement scrips

## Regulatory Changes

The surveillance framework continues to monitor companies undergoing insolvency resolution processes with a staged approach:
- Stage 0: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company
- Stage 1: Commencement of Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP)
- Stage 2: Advanced stage of IBC proceedings

Securities are subject to enhanced surveillance measures based on their IBC stage, with movements between stages based on developments in insolvency proceedings.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the changed surveillance status of affected securities
- Trading members should be aware of applicable surveillance measures for securities in different IBC stages
- Enhanced due diligence required for securities under IBC framework
- Investors should monitor corporate announcements from companies in Stage 0

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: January 01, 2026 - New surveillance classifications come into effect

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities moving to Stage 0 may experience modified trading parameters. Exclusion of Indosolar Ltd from ASM framework normalizes its trading status.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding securities under IBC surveillance should monitor insolvency proceedings closely. Stage 0 classification indicates potential insolvency risk based on corporate disclosures.

**Market Impact**: Limited broader market impact as changes affect specific companies under financial distress. The framework provides transparency on insolvency-related risks for market participants.
