## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Stakeholders:**

**Existing Public Shareholders:** Significant dilution with 75% reduction in holdings (3:4 consolidation), though they retain 4,17,093 shares collectively. The total shareholding base expanded dramatically from 34.96 lakh to 7.48 crore shares due to merger.

**Promoters:** Complete elimination of existing promoter holdings as part of IBC resolution process.

**Resolution Applicant:** Acquired 30 lakh shares (approximately 4% of post-restructuring capital) with one-year lock-in, becoming key stakeholder.

**RNIT Solutions & Services Limited Shareholders:** Received 5 RNIT AI shares for every 1 share held, representing the bulk of new shares (7.14 crore shares or ~95.4% of total).

**Market Impact:** Trading restricted to XT Group and Trade-to-Trade segment indicates higher risk classification and surveillance measures. Limited liquidity expected with market lot of 1 share and trade-to-trade settlement. The company's emergence from IBC proceedings may attract distressed asset investors while requiring careful monitoring by regulators.
