## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any deals in the specified debentures (INE244L07580) from January 1, 2026
- Trading members are required to take note of the suspension and inform relevant clients holding or interested in these securities
- Compliance with BSE's corporate action processing requirements for debt securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 30, 2025
- **Record Date**: January 1, 2026
- **Trading Suspension Date**: January 1, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of this specific debenture series. The suspension prevents secondary market trading but does not affect the redemption process or interest payment to existing holders.

**Investor Impact**: High for current debenture holders who cannot exit positions through secondary market from January 1, 2026. However, this is expected as the debentures are being redeemed. Investors will receive redemption proceeds and final interest payment as per the debenture terms.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trading in this security and communicate the suspension to affected clients. Standard corporate action processing procedures apply.
