## Compliance Requirements

- Investors and intermediaries should note the revised payment schedule for coupon payments
- Updated cash flow schedule should be used for all future calculations and planning
- Debenture trustees and paying agents must ensure payments are made as per revised schedule

## Important Dates

- Coupon payments: Semi-annual from March 28, 2024 to September 28, 2032
- First Partial Redemption: September 27, 2030 (30% of face value)
- Second Partial Redemption: September 26, 2031 (additional 30% of face value)
- Final Redemption: September 28, 2032 (remaining 40% of face value)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium - This is primarily an administrative update affecting NCD holders of Tata Power. The changes relate to specific payment dates being adjusted to comply with business day conventions, which may result in slight timing differences (typically 1-3 days) for certain coupon payments.

**Investor Impact:** Medium - Existing NCD holders should update their cash flow expectations and ensure their records reflect the revised payment schedule. The actual amounts and overall structure remain unchanged, only specific payment dates are adjusted to fall on business days as per convention.

**Operational Impact:** Low - Payment infrastructure and systems need to be updated with the revised schedule to ensure timely processing of coupon payments and redemptions.
