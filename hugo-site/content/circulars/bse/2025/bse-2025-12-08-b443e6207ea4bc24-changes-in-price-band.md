## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 10 securities effective December 9, 2025, through Notice No. 20251208-45. The revised bands range from 2% to 20%, representing surveillance measures to control price volatility. Trading members are notified of these changes which will restrict the maximum price movement allowed for these scrips during trading sessions.

## Regulatory Changes

BSE Surveillance Department has revised price band restrictions under its market surveillance framework. Price bands limit the maximum percentage by which a security's price can move up or down during a trading session. Tighter bands (2-5%) indicate heightened surveillance due to concerns about volatility, liquidity, or market integrity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect new price bands before market opening on December 9, 2025
- Orders exceeding the revised price bands will be rejected by the trading system
- Members should inform their clients about the revised trading restrictions
- Any clarifications should be directed to BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 8, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 9, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements for these 10 securities, potentially reducing liquidity and limiting trading opportunities. Securities with 2% bands will experience the most significant trading restrictions.

**Trading Impact**: Securities with tighter bands (2-5%) will face limited price discovery and may experience reduced trading volumes. The 2% band on Arunjyoti Bio Ventures, Fynx Capital, Nutricircle is particularly restrictive and suggests regulatory concerns.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these securities will face constraints on exit opportunities during the trading day. The restrictions are designed to protect investors from excessive volatility but may also reduce liquidity.
