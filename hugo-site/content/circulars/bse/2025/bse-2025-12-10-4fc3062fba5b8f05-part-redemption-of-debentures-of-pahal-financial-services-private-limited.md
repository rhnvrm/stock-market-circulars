## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact as it involves privately placed debentures of PAHAL FINANCIAL SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED. The part redemption reduces the outstanding face value of the debentures, which is a normal debt servicing activity. Trading members holding or dealing in these specific debenture series need to update their systems to reflect the new reduced face values from December 15, 2025. The impact is limited to debenture holders and trading members involved in debt segment transactions.
