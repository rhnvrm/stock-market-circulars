## Summary

Four securities are being newly added to the ST-ASM Stage I framework, while six securities are being removed from the framework. No securities are moving between different ASM stages. The ST-ASM framework is a surveillance mechanism applied to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or unusual trading patterns.

## Key Points

- 4 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework (Stage I)
- 6 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages
- Changes effective from November 26, 2025
- Framework includes both main board and SME scrips
- Consolidated list provided with current ASM stage classifications

## Securities Being Added to ST-ASM (Stage I)

1. **Jet Freight Logistics Ltd** (543420, INE982V01025) - As per NSE
2. **Mayur Leather Products Ltd** (531680, INE799E01011)
3. **Mish Designs Ltd** (544015, INE0QI101019) - SME Scrip
4. **Olatech Solutions Ltd** (543578, INE0M3901015) - SME Scrip

6. **Southern Magnesium & Chemicals Ltd** (513498, INE308N01012)

## Regulatory Framework

The ST-ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities with abnormal price behavior. Securities under ST-ASM are subject to:

- Enhanced surveillance by the exchange
- Potential trading restrictions
- Staged approach (5/15/30 days)
- Progressive measures based on continued surveillance triggers

Securities may move out of ST-ASM into other frameworks including LT-ASM (Long Term ASM), Trade for Trade, GSM (Graded Surveillance Measure), Pledge Framework, or ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised surveillance categorization
- Enhanced due diligence required for securities under ST-ASM
- Investors should be aware of increased surveillance on these securities
- Risk management systems should be updated to reflect new classifications

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 26, 2025
- **Circular Date**: November 25, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The addition of securities to ST-ASM indicates they have triggered surveillance parameters based on price movements or trading patterns. This serves as a caution to investors about potential volatility or unusual activity. Securities moving out of ST-ASM may have stabilized or moved to other surveillance frameworks. The measure is protective in nature and aims to maintain market integrity while alerting investors to exercise additional caution when trading these securities.
