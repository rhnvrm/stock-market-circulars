## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market-wide impact as it pertains to a single asset management company's new product launch. The introduction of TITANIUM HYBRID LONG-SHORT FUND adds to the specialized investment fund options available to investors seeking hybrid long-short strategies. BSE members participating in mutual fund distribution will need to familiarize themselves with the NFO timeline and payment requirements. The specialized nature of the SIF category means this offering targets sophisticated investors rather than retail market participants. Operational impact is confined to BSE StAR MF Platform participants handling TATA MUTUAL FUND transactions during the specified NFO period.
