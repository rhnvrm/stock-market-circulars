## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their shareholding double from the combined effect of the 1:2 split and 1:1 bonus issue. Each original share of ₹10 becomes 4 shares of ₹5 (2 from split, then doubled by bonus).

**Market Impact**: The stock split improves affordability and liquidity by reducing the price per share. The bonus issue signals company's confidence and capitalizes reserves without cash outflow.

**Capital Structure**: Total paid-up capital increases from ₹4,15,52,680 to ₹8,31,05,360 through capitalization of reserves. Outstanding shares increase from 83,10,536 to 1,66,21,072.

**Trading Impact**: New ISIN will be assigned. Existing shareholders need not take any action as bonus shares will be credited automatically to demat accounts.
