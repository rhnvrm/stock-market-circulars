## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects 99 scrips but quantities are generally small except for a few cases. Most major companies have minimal quantities (1-100 shares).

**Operational Impact**: Affects clearing members and brokers who have failed delivery obligations. They will need to participate in the auction to close out positions.

**Investor Impact**: Limited direct impact on regular investors. This is a back-office settlement process between clearing members. May result in some price volatility in smaller scrips with larger auction quantities during the auction window.
