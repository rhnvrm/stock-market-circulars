## Impact Assessment

This is a routine commercial paper listing with minimal market impact. The listing adds short-term debt instruments to BSE's debt segment, providing liquidity options for institutional investors. The strong credit ratings (A1+) indicate high creditworthiness. The 3-month maturity period (November 2025 to February 2026) represents typical short-term commercial paper tenure. Impact is limited to debt market participants and does not affect equity markets or retail investors.
