## Summary

BSE has announced that equity shares of Infinity Infoway Limited (Scrip Code: 544567), currently listed on the SME platform, will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to the Rolling settlement segment (M Group) effective October 24, 2025. This follows the company's SME IPO listing and represents a standard progression in trading classification.

## Key Points

- Company: Infinity Infoway Limited (SME IPO)
- Scrip Code: 544567
- Current Classification: Trade for Trade segment (MT Group)
- New Classification: Rolling segment (M Group)
- Effective Date: Friday, October 24, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for Infinity Infoway Limited will shift from Trade for Trade (T2T) settlement to Rolling settlement. In T2T, delivery of shares and payment must occur, whereas Rolling settlement allows for intraday trading and standard T+2 settlement cycles. This change enhances liquidity and trading flexibility for the scrip.

- **October 8, 2025**: Confirmation notice issued (Notice No. 20251008-6)
- **October 24, 2025**: Effective date for transfer to Rolling segment (M Group)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The transition from Trade for Trade to Rolling settlement typically improves liquidity and trading volumes as it allows for intraday trading and reduces settlement obligations. This is positive for investor participation.

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium - Trading members need to update internal systems and processes to accommodate the group change, but this is a routine operational adjustment.

**Investor Impact**: Positive - Investors will benefit from enhanced liquidity, ability to execute intraday trades, and reduced margin requirements compared to the T2T segment.
