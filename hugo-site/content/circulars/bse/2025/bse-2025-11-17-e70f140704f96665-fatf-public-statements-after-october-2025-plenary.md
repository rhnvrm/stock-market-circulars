title: FATF Public Statements after October 2025 Plenary
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a user manual for trading members to comply with FATF (Financial Action Task Force) declaration requirements following the October 2025 Plenary. SEBI periodically releases lists of jurisdictions requiring enhanced due diligence. Trading members must identify clients from these jurisdictions through the BEFS portal and submit declarations, irrespective of whether they have such clients.

## Key Points

- Trading members must identify clients belonging to FATF-specified jurisdictions
- Declarations must be submitted through BEFS portal (https://befs.bseindia.com/login.aspx)

- If members have clients from specified jurisdictions, a CSV file with Unique Client Code and Client Name must be uploaded
- SEBI template must be printed on company letterhead, signed/stamped by MD/Compliance Officer, or digitally signed
- Acknowledgement email sent upon successful submission
- Members must maintain proper alert mechanisms for ongoing monitoring of client relationships with specified jurisdictions

## Regulatory Changes
