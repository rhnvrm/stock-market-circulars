Shareholders will receive equity shares in both resulting companies in a 1:1 ratio.

## Key Points

- Record date revised to December 26, 2025 (changed from previous date announced on December 17, 2025)
- Ex-entitlement date: December 26, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-785/2025-2026)
- Demerger approved by Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal, New Delhi
- Two separate demergers: Chemical Undertaking and Rayon Undertaking
- Share allocation ratio: 1:1 for both resulting companies (1 share of Rs. 2/- face value for every 1 share held in DCM Shriram Industries)
- Trading in DCM Shriram Industries will be transferred from 'B' Group to 'T' Group effective December 26, 2025
- Scrip will be part of Call Auction in Special Pre-open Session (SPOS) on December 26, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Pursuant to SEBI Circular No. SEBI/Cir/ISD/1/2010 dated November 2, 2010, the equity shares of DCM Shriram Industries Ltd (Demerged Company) will be transferred from 'B' Group to 'T' Group with effect from December 26, 2025.

## Important Dates

- **Settlement Number**: DR-785/2025-2026
- **Group Transfer Date**: December 26, 2025 (B Group to T Group)
- **Call Auction Date**: December 26, 2025 (SPOS)
- **Notice Date**: December 18, 2025
- **Previous Notice Reference**: Notice No. 20251217-7 dated December 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The demerger represents a significant corporate restructuring that will create two independent listed entities from DCM Shriram Industries. The transfer to T Group and mandatory call auction will restrict normal trading and may result in price volatility.

**Shareholder Impact**: Shareholders as of December 26, 2025 will receive shares in both resulting companies at a 1:1 ratio, effectively tripling their holdings (retaining original shares plus receiving shares in two new companies).

**Trading Impact**: Trading restrictions through T Group classification and call auction mechanism will limit liquidity and require traders to adjust their strategies. Normal trading will resume once the resulting companies are listed and the demerger is complete.

**Operational Impact**: The demerger separates the Chemical Undertaking and Rayon Undertaking into focused entities - DCM Shriram Fine Chemicals Ltd and DCM Shriram International Ltd respectively, allowing for specialized operational management.
