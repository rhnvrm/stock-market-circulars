## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Limited to shareholders of Annvrridhhi Ventures Limited. The extension provides additional time for eligible shareholders to make subscription decisions and arrange funds, potentially improving participation rates in the rights issue.

**Shareholder Impact:** Positive for existing shareholders as they receive 14 additional days to evaluate and subscribe to the rights issue. Those who had missed the original deadline now have extended opportunity to participate.

**Operational Impact:** Post-issue activities including basis of allotment, actual allotment, credit of shares, and listing are correspondingly delayed by approximately 14 days. The company and registrar will need to maintain subscription infrastructure for the extended period.

**Company Impact:** Extension may indicate lower-than-expected subscription levels or company's intent to maximize shareholder participation. The delay in fund receipt and subsequent business deployment is minor given the short extension period.
