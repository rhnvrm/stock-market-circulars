## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact (High)**: Existing shareholders will receive 4 additional shares for every 1 share held, resulting in a five-fold increase in shareholding quantity. This will proportionally dilute the share price while maintaining overall market capitalization.

**Market Impact (High)**: The allotment of 3.54 crore bonus shares represents a significant increase in the company's issued share capital. Post-bonus, the stock price will likely adjust to approximately one-fifth of the pre-bonus price to reflect the increased share count.

**Liquidity Impact (Medium-High)**: The substantial increase in total shares outstanding is expected to improve trading liquidity for the stock.

**Administrative Impact**: Depositories and trading systems must process the bonus share credits and make them available for trading by the specified deadlines, ensuring seamless market operations.
