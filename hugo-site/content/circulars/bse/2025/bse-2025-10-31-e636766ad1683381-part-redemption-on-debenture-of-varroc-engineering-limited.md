## Impact Assessment

**For Debenture Holders**: Partial return of principal along with interest payment on the record date. The reduced face value reflects the partial redemption, and future interest payments will be calculated on the new reduced face value of Rs. 68,750.

**For Trading Members**: Must update systems to reflect the reduced face value for all trading and settlement activities from November 7, 2025 onwards. Price discovery and valuation models should account for the reduced principal amount.

**Market Impact**: Limited broader market impact as this is a privately placed debt instrument. Impact confined to existing debenture holders and their trading activities.
