## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The preferential allotment of approximately 77.78 million shares represents a significant capital raise for Rama Steel Tubes Limited. The issue price of Rs. 11.25 per share indicates the valuation at which non-promoter investors subscribed to the offering.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution from this preferential allotment. The lock-in period until June 14, 2026 (approximately 7 months from listing) prevents immediate selling pressure from allottees.

**Trading Impact**: The new shares will be available for trading from November 19, 2025, potentially increasing liquidity in the stock. However, the lock-in restrictions mean these specific shares cannot be traded until mid-2026.
