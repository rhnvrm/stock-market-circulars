## Summary

BSE has issued detailed Terms of Reference (TOR) for cyber security and cyber resilience audits applicable to trading members. The circular establishes comprehensive cybersecurity governance requirements based on the Cyber Security and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF), including mandatory designation of Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), budget allocation, employee screening procedures, and third-party service provider management.

## Key Points

- Trading members must designate a senior official as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) reporting directly to MD & CEO
- CISO must possess sufficient qualifications and capabilities, with standing equivalent to CTO/CIO level
- Adequate percentage of total IT budget must be allocated to cybersecurity under separate budgetary head
- Time-bound reporting procedures required for cybersecurity incidents to CISO or senior management
- All employees must undergo security screening, proper onboarding training, and regular security training
- Confidentiality and integrity agreements mandatory with third-party service providers
- Due diligence required for all third-party service providers accessing IT systems
- Requirements vary by organization size: Qualified REs, Mid-size, and Small-size entities

## Regulatory Changes

The circular introduces structured cybersecurity governance framework with specific standards:

- **GV.RR.S3**: CISO designation and reporting structure requirements
- **GV.RR.S4**: IT budget allocation for cybersecurity
- **GV.RR.S5 & GV.RR.S6**: Resource allocation and employee screening procedures
- **GV.PO.S1, S2, S5**: Policy formulation requirements (multiple sub-sections)

Differentiated compliance requirements based on organization classification with varying applicability (Yes/No) across Qualified REs, Mid-size, and Small-size trading members.
