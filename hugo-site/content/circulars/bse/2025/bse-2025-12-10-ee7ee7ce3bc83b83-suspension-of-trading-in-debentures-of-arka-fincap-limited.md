---

## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in two series of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) issued by ARKA FINCAP LIMITED effective December 12, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these specified debentures from the no-dealings date.

## Key Points

- Two NCD series affected: AFL-9%-27-12-25-NCD (ISIN: INE03W107264, Code: 939142) and AFL-9.3%-27-12-25-NCD (ISIN: INE03W107215, Code: 939144)
- Record date set for December 12, 2025
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- No dealings permitted from December 12, 2025
- Notice number: 20251210-14 / DR-776/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard operational notice for debenture redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from December 12, 2025
- Members are required to take note of the suspension and ensure compliance with the no-dealings restriction
- Adherence to the record date mechanism for determining eligible debenture holders for redemption and interest payment

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 10, 2025
- **Record Date**: December 12, 2025
- **No Dealings From**: December 12, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited impact as this affects only two specific debenture series of ARKA FINCAP LIMITED in the debt segment. The suspension is temporary and procedural in nature, related to the redemption process.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders as of the record date will be entitled to redemption proceeds and interest payment. Secondary market liquidity for these instruments will be unavailable from the suspension date.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to prevent inadvertent trading in these suspended securities. The suspension is routine for debenture maturity/redemption events.
