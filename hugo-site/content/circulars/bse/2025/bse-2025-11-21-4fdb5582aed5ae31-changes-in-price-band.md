title: Changes in Price Band for 35 Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 35 securities effective November 24, 2025. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20%, with most securities (27 out of 35) being assigned a 5% price band. This represents a surveillance measure to control excessive price volatility in these scrips.

## Key Points

- 35 securities will have revised price bands effective November 24, 2025
- 27 securities assigned 5% price band
- 5 securities assigned 10% price band (CLN Energy, Colorchips New Media, Eighty Jewellers, Venus Remedies, Viji Finance)
- 2 securities assigned 20% price band (Athena Constructions)
- 1 security assigned 2% price band (UTL Industries)
- Notice issued by BSE Surveillance department
- Members can seek clarifications at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

Price bands are being revised from their existing levels as a surveillance measure. Price bands restrict the maximum percentage change allowed in a security's price during a trading session, helping to curb excessive speculation and volatility.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement the revised price bands in their trading systems
- The revised bands must be effective from November 24, 2025
- Trading members should ensure compliance with the new price movement restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 21, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The tightening of price bands will limit daily price movements for these 35 securities, potentially reducing trading volumes and liquidity. Investors holding these stocks will face restrictions on price discovery.

**Trading Impact**: Traders will need to adjust strategies for these securities given the reduced daily price movement limits. The 2% band on UTL Industries represents the most restrictive measure.

**Investor Impact**: This is a surveillance measure typically applied to securities showing unusual price behavior or lacking adequate market depth. Investors should exercise caution as these restrictions often indicate heightened risk or regulatory concerns about the securities.
