## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact. This is a routine preferential allotment listing for a small-cap company. The 18 lakh shares represent capital raised through warrant conversion at Rs. 16.80 per share (total consideration approximately Rs. 3.02 crores). The complete lock-in until mid-2026 means no immediate selling pressure. The preferential allotment to non-promoters suggests fundraising for business operations without diluting promoter control.
