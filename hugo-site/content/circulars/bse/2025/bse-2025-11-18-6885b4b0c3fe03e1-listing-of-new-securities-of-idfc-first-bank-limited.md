- **Lock-in Expiry**: July 31, 2026
- **Notice Date**: November 18, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The issuance represents a significant dilution for existing shareholders with 81.27 crore new shares. However, the lock-in period until July 31, 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure. The preferential allotment to non-promoters at Rs. 60 per share provides information on the company's capital raising activities and valuation expectations.

**Operational Impact**: The conversion of CCPS to equity shares strengthens the bank's equity capital base and reduces preference capital obligations. This improves the capital structure and may positively impact regulatory capital ratios.

**Investor Consideration**: Existing shareholders should factor in the dilution impact. The lock-in period provides a buffer before these shares can be traded freely in the market.
