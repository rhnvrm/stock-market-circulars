This change will be effective for all trades executed on and from December 12, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN Number: INE495P01020
- Company: MRS. BECTORS FOOD SPECIALITIES LTD
- Scrip Code: 543253

- Ex-Date for new ISIN: December 12, 2025
- Demat Request Number: DR-776/2025-2026
- Notice continues from Exchange Notice No. 20251120-48 dated November 20, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a notification of implementation details for a previously announced corporate action (share subdivision).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN number INE495P01020 for all trades in MRS. BECTORS FOOD SPECIALITIES LTD executed on or after December 12, 2025
- Systems and databases must be updated to reflect the new ISIN for subdivided equity shares of Rs.2/- face value

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 5, 2025
- **Ex-Date for New ISIN**: December 12, 2025 (trades from this date will use new ISIN INE495P01020)
- **Previous Notice Reference**: November 20, 2025 (Notice No. 20251120-48)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share subdivision and ISIN change will affect all existing shareholders and traders. While the total value of holdings remains unchanged, the number of shares will increase by 5x (Rs.10 to Rs.2 subdivision). This typically improves liquidity by making shares more affordable for retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems, back-office systems, and demat records must be updated to reflect the new ISIN from the ex-date. Brokers and depositories need to ensure seamless transition to avoid settlement issues. Shareholders will see revised share quantities in their demat accounts post-subdivision.
