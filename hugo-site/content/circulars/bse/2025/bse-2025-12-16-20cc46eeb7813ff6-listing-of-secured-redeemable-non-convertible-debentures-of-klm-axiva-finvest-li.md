## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to debt securities of a single non-banking financial company. The issuance provides investors with fixed-income investment options across various maturity tenors and interest payment structures. The BBB rating indicates moderate credit risk. The listing expands the debt securities market on BSE but does not affect equity markets or broader trading operations. Investors in these NCDs now have secondary market liquidity through BSE's debt trading platform.
