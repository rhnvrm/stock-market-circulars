## Summary

BSE has approved the listing of 68,06,08,792 (680.6 million) new equity shares of Infibeam Avenues Ltd. (Scrip Code: 539807). These shares arise from the conversion of partly paid shares to fully paid shares of Rs. 1/- each, issued on a rights basis. Trading members are permitted to trade these new securities starting Monday, December 29, 2025.

## Key Points

- **Number of shares**: 68,06,08,792 equity shares of Rs. 1/- each
- **Origin**: Conversion of partly paid shares to fully paid shares

- No special compliance actions required beyond normal trading procedures

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 26, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: December 29, 2025 (Monday)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of 680.6 million new shares significantly increases the free float and tradable quantity of Infibeam Avenues stock. This represents a substantial dilution event, though existing shareholders who participated in the rights issue maintain their proportional ownership.

**Liquidity Impact**: Medium - The large number of newly listed shares may improve liquidity but could also create short-term selling pressure if rights issue subscribers choose to exit their positions.

**Investor Consideration**: These shares are pari-passu (rank equally) with existing equity shares, carrying the same rights and privileges. Investors should factor in the increased share count when evaluating market capitalization and per-share metrics.
