## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The listing adds a new automotive component manufacturer to BSE. With over 6.34 crore shares freely tradable from day one (IPO public portion), the stock provides immediate liquidity for investors. The staggered lock-in releases over the next two years will gradually increase available float.

**Operational Impact**: The listing enables Tenneco Clean Air India Limited to access public capital markets for future fundraising and provides enhanced corporate visibility. The company operates in the automotive exhaust systems and clean air solutions sector.

**Investor Impact**: Different investor categories face varying liquidity constraints. Retail and institutional investors who participated in the IPO public portion can trade freely, while anchor investors and promoters/early investors face restrictions ranging from 30 days to 2 years. The complex capital structure history (with 56.36 crore shares previously cancelled) requires careful analysis by potential investors.

**Sector Context**: Tenneco is a global automotive supplier, and this listing represents the Indian subsidiary's public market debut, providing investors exposure to the automotive components and emission control systems sector.
