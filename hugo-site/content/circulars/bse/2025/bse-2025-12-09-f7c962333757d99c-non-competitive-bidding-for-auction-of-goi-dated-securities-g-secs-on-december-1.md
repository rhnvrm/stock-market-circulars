## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine operational notice for government securities auction participation. The NCB facility provides retail and non-institutional investors access to G-sec auctions, but participation is voluntary.

**Operational Impact**: Low. The circular provides procedural information for members already familiar with the NCB-GSec module. Contact details are provided for technical support (user ID creation, password reset), bidding queries, and settlement-related issues through BSE Trading Operations and ICCL Operations teams.

**Investor Impact**: Minimal. This facility allows interested participants to invest in government securities through the non-competitive route, but does not create any mandatory obligations or restrictions.
