## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: October 31, 2025 - Date for determining shareholder entitlement for the demerger
- **Ex-Entitlement Date**: October 31, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-747/2025-2026) - Trading commences on ex-basis from this date
- **Transfer to T Group**: October 31, 2025 - Scrip moves from A Group to T Group
- **Special Pre-open Session**: October 31, 2025 - Scrip will trade under call auction in SPOS

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders of Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Industries Limited will receive shares in Dalmia Bharat Refractories Limited based on the specified ratio (1:48.18). This corporate restructuring separates the DMC Unit and GT Unit operations into a separate listed entity, potentially unlocking value and providing focused investment opportunities.

**Trading Impact**: The transfer to 'T' Group indicates temporary trading restrictions typical for corporate actions. The Special Pre-open Session requirement ensures price discovery through call auction mechanism on the critical ex-entitlement date, protecting investors from excessive volatility.

**Market Impact**: This is a significant corporate restructuring of a listed company involving business unit separation. The demerger creates two independent entities allowing investors to value each business separately. The specified entitlement ratio suggests substantial value allocation to the refractories business.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to reflect the group change, handle the entitlement calculations, and ensure smooth processing of the new share allotments. The SPOS mechanism requires members to participate in call auction procedures on October 31, 2025.
