The circular includes annexures showing securities at various IBC stages, securities moving between stages, and notably, two securities being excluded from the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework: JR Foods Ltd (Scrip Code: 530915, ISIN: INE989E01018) and Future Supply Chain Solutions Ltd (Scrip Code: 540798, ISIN: INE935Q01015). The consolidated list shows 13+ securities currently under various stages of IBC surveillance.

- No new securities added to Stage 1 (IRP under IBC) effective October 29, 2025
- No securities moved from Stage I to Stage II effective October 29, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The circular continues BSE's implementation of the surveillance framework for companies undergoing insolvency resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The framework includes multiple stages:

- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company
- **Stage 1**: Additional Surveillance Measure for Companies relating to the Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP) as per IBC
- **Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance measure

The framework also identifies T+0 scrips shortlisted in IBC Framework as per parent company (marked with ~) and recommencement scrips (marked with ^).

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note the exclusion of JR Foods Ltd and Future Supply Chain Solutions Ltd from IBC-related ASM effective October 29, 2025
- Investors and traders should monitor the consolidated list of securities under IBC surveillance stages for risk assessment
- Trading members should be aware of special notations for T+0 scrips and recommencement scrips in the IBC framework
- Market participants should track securities that may move between different IBC stages in future circulars

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 29, 2025 - Changes to IBC surveillance framework take effect
- **Circular Date**: October 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited immediate market-wide impact as no securities are being newly added to surveillance stages. The exclusion of two companies from ASM may provide relief to shareholders of JR Foods Ltd and Future Supply Chain Solutions Ltd, potentially improving liquidity and reducing trading restrictions for these securities.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for investors in the two excluded securities as removal from ASM framework typically indicates improved corporate governance or resolution of insolvency concerns. Investors holding securities in the consolidated list should continue monitoring for potential stage movements.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the removal of the two securities from IBC-related ASM framework. The consolidated list provides transparency on which securities remain under various stages of IBC surveillance, helping market participants assess risk exposure.

## Annexure Details

**Annexure I**: Lists showing no changes to Stage 0 or Stage 1, and no movements between stages.

**Annexure II**: Lists two securities excluded from ASM under IBC framework:
1. JR Foods Ltd (530915 / INE989E01018)
2. Future Supply Chain Solutions Ltd (540798 / INE935Q01015)

Enterprises Ltd, Aban Offshore Ltd, AGS Transact Technologies Ltd, Alchemist Ltd, Alps Industries Ltd, Ambition Mica Limited, Ankit Metal & Power Ltd, Ansal Properties & Infrastructure Ltd, Arshiya Limited, Axis Solutions Ltd, Baron Infotech Ltd, Birla Cotsyn (India) Ltd, and Bloom Dekor Ltd, among others.
