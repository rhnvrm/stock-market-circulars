## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions affect 13 securities with varying degrees of restriction. Securities with 2% bands (Phaarmasia, Prima Industries, Systematix Securities) face the tightest trading limits, likely due to heightened surveillance concerns. This will significantly restrict intraday price movements and may impact liquidity. Securities with wider 20% bands (Gallard Steel, Seshachal Technologies) retain more trading flexibility. Investors and traders in these securities should adjust strategies accordingly and expect reduced volatility within the new bands.
