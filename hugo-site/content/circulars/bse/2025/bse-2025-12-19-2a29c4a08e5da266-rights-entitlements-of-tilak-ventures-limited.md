## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Inform all clients about commencement of REs trading with ISIN details
- Clarify that REs are not ordinary shares of the company
- Include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases stating:
  - Purchase of REs only grants right to participate in Rights Issue by making application with requisite money OR renounce REs before issue closes
  - Un-subscribed and un-renounced REs will lapse and be extinguished after Issue Closing Date
- Refer to notice nos. 20200305-21 and 20200518-34 for additional guidelines

## Important Dates

- **December 19, 2025**: Notice date

- **January 09, 2026**: Rights Issue closing date; deadline for subscription or renunciation

## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Shareholders:** Existing shareholders of Tilak Ventures Limited receive rights entitlements that can be either exercised (by subscribing to the rights issue with payment) or renounced (sold in the market) during the specified trading window. Un-actioned REs will become worthless after January 09, 2026.

**Market Impact:** Limited to shareholders and investors interested in Tilak Ventures Limited. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade mechanism ensures proper tracking of RE transfers. Demat-only trading reduces operational risks and ensures proper record-keeping.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update systems to handle RE trading, ensure proper client communication, and modify contract note templates to include mandatory disclaimers.
