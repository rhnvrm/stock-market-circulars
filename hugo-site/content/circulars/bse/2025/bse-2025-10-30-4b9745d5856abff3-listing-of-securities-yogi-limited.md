## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of preferential shares issued to promoters. The shares represent dilution but are locked-in for approximately 20 months from trading commencement, preventing immediate market impact.

**Investor Impact**: Low immediate impact. The warrant conversion indicates promoter commitment, but the locked-in nature means no trading liquidity from these shares until mid-2027.
