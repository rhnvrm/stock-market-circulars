title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective November 13, 2025. One new security, Thangamayil Jewellery Ltd (Scrip Code: 533158), has been added to the LT-ASM framework. Two securities, Ashnisha Industries Ltd and Shahi Shipping Ltd, are being removed from the framework due to inclusion in other surveillance measures (ESM and GSM respectively). No securities are being moved to higher or lower ASM stages, and no securities are being placed directly into Stage IV.

## Key Points

- Thangamayil Jewellery Ltd (533158, INE085J01014) newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework
- Ashnisha Industries Ltd (541702, INE694W01024) moving out due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- Shahi Shipping Ltd (526508, INE825D01016) moving out due to inclusion in GSM Framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages
- Changes effective from November 13, 2025
- Consolidated list includes 16+ securities continuing in various ASM stages

## Regulatory Changes

The LT-ASM framework continues to identify securities that show concerning patterns requiring additional surveillance. Securities in this framework face enhanced monitoring and trading restrictions designed to protect investors. The framework operates across multiple stages (I through IV) with progressively stricter measures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors and brokers must be aware of LT-ASM status of securities before trading
- Securities under LT-ASM typically have higher margin requirements and trading restrictions
- Market participants should review the consolidated list to understand which securities are affected
- Enhanced disclosure and monitoring requirements apply to these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 13, 2025 - All changes to LT-ASM framework take effect

## Impact Assessment

The addition of Thangamayil Jewellery Ltd to the LT-ASM framework will result in increased trading restrictions and higher margin requirements for this security. Investors holding or planning to trade this stock should be prepared for reduced liquidity and stricter trading conditions. The removal of Ashnisha Industries Ltd and Shahi Shipping Ltd from LT-ASM indicates these securities now fall under other surveillance frameworks (ESM and GSM), which may have different but equally stringent restrictions. Overall market impact is limited to specific securities and their investors.
