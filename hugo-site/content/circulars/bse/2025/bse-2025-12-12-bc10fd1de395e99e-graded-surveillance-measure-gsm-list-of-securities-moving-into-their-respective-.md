## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Movement to higher GSM stages typically results in reduced liquidity and increased trading costs due to additional surveillance measures includingASM margins, price bands, and trading restrictions.

**Operational Impact:** Trading in these securities will be subject to stage-specific restrictions which may include reduced price bands, additional surveillance deposit requirements, and periodic call auctions depending on the GSM stage.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities should expect increased volatility constraints, potential reduction in trading volumes, and higher margin requirements. Stage IV classification for JMG Corporation represents the highest level of surveillance with strictest trading conditions.
