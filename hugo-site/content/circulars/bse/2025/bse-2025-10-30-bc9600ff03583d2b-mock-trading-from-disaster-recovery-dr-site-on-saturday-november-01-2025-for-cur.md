## Important Dates

- **Mock Trading Date**: Saturday, November 01, 2025
- **Circular Date**: October 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members in Currency Derivatives segment must reconfigure systems for the mock session. This is a planned activity on a weekend (Saturday) to minimize disruption to regular trading.

**Market Impact**: Low - No impact on live trading as this is a mock session conducted on a non-trading day.

**Technical Impact**: Medium - Requires technical teams to modify connection parameters and verify DR connectivity across multiple systems including trading platforms and back-office applications.

**Business Continuity**: High importance for preparedness - Regular DR testing is critical for ensuring seamless failover capability in case of actual disasters or primary site failures. This exercise validates that trading members can successfully connect and operate from the DR infrastructure.
