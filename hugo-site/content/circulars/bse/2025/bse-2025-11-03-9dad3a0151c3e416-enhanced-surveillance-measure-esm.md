## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and investors must be aware of ESM securities and associated trading restrictions

- Market participants should review the stage-wise ESM requirements applicable to these securities

**Trading Impact**: Securities added to or moved within ESM framework face stricter trading conditions including higher margin requirements and potential reduced liquidity
