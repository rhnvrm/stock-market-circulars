## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this affects a single company listing in the restricted XT Group. The security is subject to Trade-to-Trade settlement, indicating higher risk classification and limited liquidity. The capital reduction scheme addresses historical accumulated losses, bringing the company's capital structure in line with its net worth. Investors should note the XT Group classification suggests higher volatility or surveillance concerns. The small capital base (6.94 lakh shares) indicates a micro-cap security with likely limited trading volumes.
