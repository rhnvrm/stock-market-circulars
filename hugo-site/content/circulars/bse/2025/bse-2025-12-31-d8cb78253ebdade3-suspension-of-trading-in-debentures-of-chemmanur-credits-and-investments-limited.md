## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in two series of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) issued by Chemmanur Credits and Investments Limited. The suspension is effective from January 2, 2026, as the company has fixed January 3, 2026 as the record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these specific debentures.

## Key Points

- CCIL-9.5%-19-1-26-NCD (ISIN: INE051307BH3, Code: 940079)
- CCIL-19-1-26-NCD (ISIN: INE051307BN1, Code: 940091)
- Record date set for January 3, 2026
- Trading suspension begins January 2, 2026
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Notice reference: DR-790/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational suspension related to corporate action processing.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from January 2, 2026
- Trading members are required to take note of the suspension and communicate to relevant clients holding these instruments
- No dealings permitted in securities code 940079 and 940091 from the specified date

## Important Dates

- **December 31, 2025**: Circular issued
- **January 2, 2026**: Trading suspension begins (no dealings from this date)
- **January 3, 2026**: Record date for redemption and interest payment

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of the two specific NCD series. The suspension is temporary and directly related to the redemption process. Trading members dealing in debt securities need to ensure compliance.

**Investor Impact**: NCD holders as of the record date (January 3, 2026) will receive their redemption proceeds and final interest payment. No trading opportunity available from January 2, 2026 onwards.

**Operational Impact**: Standard corporate action processing. Trading systems should reflect the suspension status for the affected ISINs to prevent inadvertent trading.
