## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The listing of 5,49,698 shares represents a relatively small addition to the company's equity base. The majority of shares (72.16%) are subject to lock-in until April 2027, while the remaining 27.84% are locked in until April 2026, limiting immediate trading liquidity.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal impact on existing shareholders. New shares rank pari-passu with existing equity, maintaining equal rights. The staggered lock-in schedule prevents sudden dilution effects on market price.

**Investor Consideration**: Investors should note the warrant conversion reflects confidence from promoter and non-promoter entities at the issue price of Rs. 470.70 per share.
