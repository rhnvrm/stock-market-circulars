title: Change in BSE Focused IT Methodology
---

## Summary

BSE Index Services announces significant changes to the BSE Focused IT Index methodology pursuant to SEBI Circular No.HO/47/15/11(1)2025-MRD-TPD1 dated October 30, 2025. The index will expand from 10 to 14 constituents, with revised selection criteria emphasizing derivative-linked stocks. Weight capping constraints have been strengthened to reduce concentration risk, lowering individual stock caps from 33% to 20% and aggregate top-3 stock weight from 63% to 45%.

## Key Points

- Index constituent count increases from 10 to 14 stocks
- Top 11 derivative-linked companies automatically selected (up from top 7)
- Buffer zone for existing constituents expanded to ranks 12-17 (from 8-12)
- Individual stock weight cap reduced from 33% to 20%
- Top 3 stocks aggregate weight capped at 45% (down from 63%)
- New cap introduced: Top 5 stocks limited to 60% aggregate weight
- Derivative linkage constraints maintained at 5% individual and 20% aggregate for non-derivative stocks
- Universe remains all BSE 500 companies in Information Technology sector

## Regulatory Changes

**Index Construction Changes:**

*Previous Methodology:*
- Top 7 derivative-linked companies selected
- Ranks 8-12: Existing constituents with derivative linkage retained
- Target count: 10 constituents

*New Methodology:*
- Top 11 derivative-linked companies selected
- Ranks 12-17: Existing constituents with derivative linkage retained
- Target count: 14 constituents
- Non-constituents added only if target not met, preferring derivative-linked stocks

**Weighting Changes:**

*Previous Caps:*
- Single constituent: 33% maximum
- Top 3 aggregate: 63% maximum

*New Caps:*
- Single constituent: 20% maximum
- Top 3 aggregate: 45% maximum
- Top 5 aggregate: 60% maximum (new)

**Unchanged Elements:**
- Derivative linkage constraints: 5% individual, 20% aggregate for non-derivative stocks
- Quarterly rebalancing schedule (Monday after third Friday of March, June, September, December)
- Proportional redistribution of excess weight maintaining free-float market cap rankings

## Compliance Requirements

- Index fund managers tracking BSE Focused IT Index must adjust portfolios to accommodate expanded constituent count
- Portfolio rebalancing required to comply with new weight caps during quarterly reviews
- Derivative traders should note expanded constituent list and revised concentration limits
- Market participants must update index methodology documentation and systems
- Compliance with derivative linkage constraints (5% individual, 20% aggregate) continues

## Important Dates

- **October 30, 2025**: SEBI Circular issued
- **December 5, 2025**: BSE announcement date
- **Quarterly Rebalancing**: Effective market open on Monday following third Friday of March, June, September, and December
- Next rebalancing dates subject to quarterly schedule

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Broader representation of IT sector with 40% increase in constituent count (10 to 14 stocks)
- Enhanced diversification through stricter concentration limits reduces single-stock risk
- Mid-tier IT stocks with derivative linkage may see increased demand for index inclusion
- Existing passive funds tracking this index will require portfolio restructuring

**Operational Impact:**
- Index turnover may increase during transition to new methodology
- Lower weight caps require more frequent rebalancing adjustments
- Derivative-linked stock preference may influence liquidity patterns
- Three-tier weight cap system (20%, 45%, 60%) provides better risk distribution

**Derivative Market Impact:**
- Continued emphasis on derivative linkage maintains futures/options market alignment
- Expanded constituent count may broaden derivative trading opportunities
- Weight redistribution across more stocks may reduce concentration in index futures

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Companies in ranks 8-17 have higher retention probability under new buffer zone
- Non-derivative linked stocks remain limited to 20% aggregate weight
- Selection priority remains heavily weighted toward derivative-linked stocks for market efficiency
