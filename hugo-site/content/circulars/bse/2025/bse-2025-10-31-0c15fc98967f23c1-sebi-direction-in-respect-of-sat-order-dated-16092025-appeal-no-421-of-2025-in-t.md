## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is an appellate order modifying the implementation of an existing SEBI enforcement order against Decipher Labs Ltd and associated parties.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Appellants No. 1 and 2:**
- Deposit 50% of the disgorgement and penalty amount within four weeks from September 16, 2025
- Amount to be deposited in an interest-bearing account
- May sell shares from demat account to meet deposit requirement

**For SEBI (Respondent):**

- No coercive action to recover remaining disgorgement and penalty amounts subject to 50% deposit compliance

**For Appellants:**
- File rejoinder (if any) within three weeks after SEBI's reply

## Important Dates

- **September 16, 2025**: SAT order date
- **Within 4 weeks from September 16, 2025**: Deadline for Appellants No. 1 and 2 to deposit 50% of disgorgement and penalty
- **Within 6 weeks from September 16, 2025**: SEBI to file reply
- **Within 3 weeks after SEBI reply**: Rejoinder deadline (if applicable)
- **December 1, 2025**: Next hearing date

## Impact Assessment

**Company Impact:**
Decipher Labs Ltd receives significant relief as the stay on Paragraph 105(a) allows the company to continue business development activities that would otherwise have been restricted under the SEBI order.

**Individual Appellants Impact:**
Appellants No. 1 and 2 (Mr. Janakiram Ajjarapu and associates) face immediate financial obligation to deposit 50% of disgorgement and penalty within four weeks. However, they are protected from coercive recovery action for the remaining 50% and are permitted to liquidate shareholdings to meet the requirement.

**Market Impact:**
Limited direct market impact. The order affects specific individuals and the company under SEBI enforcement action. Permission to sell shares may result in some market transactions but scope appears limited to compliance needs.

**Precedential Value:**
Demonstrates SAT's balanced approach in granting partial stays on SEBI orders - protecting business continuity while ensuring partial financial accountability through phased deposits pending full appeal hearing.
