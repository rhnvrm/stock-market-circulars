## Important Dates

- **October 8, 2025**: Circular notice date
- **October 15, 2025**: Record date for determining shareholder entitlement
- **October 15, 2025**: Ex-entitlement date (Settlement No. DR-736/2025-2026)
- **October 15, 2025**: Transfer of trading from 'A' Group to 'T' Group
- **October 15, 2025**: Special Pre-open Session (SPOS) for the scrip

## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Shareholders**: All shareholders holding SKF India Limited shares on the record date will receive an equal number of shares in SKF India (Industrial) Limited at a 1:1 ratio. This corporate action will result in shareholders holding two separate entities post-demerger.

**Impact on Trading**: The scrip will experience significant trading restrictions as it moves to the 'T' Group, which is typically used for corporate actions and special trading arrangements. The Special Pre-open Session (SPOS) on October 15, 2025 will impact normal trading procedures, with price discovery occurring through call auction mechanism.

**Impact on Market**: The demerger separates the Automotive and Industrial Business Undertaking into a distinct entity, allowing for focused business operations and potentially improved valuation transparency for each business segment. The listing of SKF India (Industrial) Limited will add a new security to the BSE platform.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers, depositories, and clearing corporations will need to process the allotment and credit of shares in the resulting company to eligible shareholders. The move to T Group requires adjusted trading protocols and risk management procedures for trading members.
