## Important Dates

- **November 12, 2025**: Circular issued

- **November 17, 2025**: Ex-rights trading begins (Settlement DR-757/2025-2026)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - This is a significant capital raising exercise by Adani Enterprises, one of India's largest conglomerates. The rights issue will result in dilution for non-participating shareholders.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders holding shares as of the record date will have the right to subscribe to additional shares at Rs.1800 per share. Non-participation will result in ownership dilution of approximately 12% (3 new shares per 25 existing shares).

**Trading Impact**: The stock will trade ex-rights from November 17, 2025, which typically results in a theoretical price adjustment to reflect the value of the rights being separated from the share price.

**Financial Impact**: The staggered payment structure (Rs.900 on application and Rs.900 on call) provides flexibility to shareholders but also creates future capital call obligations for participants.
