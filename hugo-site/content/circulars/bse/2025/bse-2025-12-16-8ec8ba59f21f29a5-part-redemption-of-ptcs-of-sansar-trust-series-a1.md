## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the reduced face values for the three PTCs
- All trading in these securities must reflect the new face values from December 17, 2025 onwards
- Market participants should update their systems to reflect the new face values
- Trading members should inform their clients holding these PTCs about the partial redemption and reduced face values

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 16, 2025
- **Effective Date for Trading at Reduced Face Value**: December 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of the three specific PTCs. The partial redemption reduces the face value of these instruments, meaning investors receive partial principal repayment while retaining certificates with lower face values.

**Investor Impact**: PTC holders will receive partial redemption proceeds while continuing to hold certificates at reduced face values. This represents early partial return of principal for these debt instruments.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems and member records must be updated to reflect the new face values. Price discovery and trading will be based on the reduced face values from the effective date.

**Segment**: Debt market segment only, specifically pass-through certificates which are structured debt instruments.
