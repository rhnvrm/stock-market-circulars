---

## Summary

Adani Total Gas Limited has clarified to BSE and NSE that a news article published on Economic Times website dated November 12, 2025, titled "Adani plans India's biggest battery storage in Gujarat" does not pertain to the company's operations or business activities. The company also stated that recent share price movements are purely market-driven and management has no control or knowledge of the reasons for volume/price movements.

## Key Points

- News article about Adani's battery storage project in Gujarat does not relate to Adani Total Gas Limited's business
- Company has no comments to offer on the news article
- Share price movements are attributed to market conditions and are market-driven
- Management claims no control or knowledge of reasons for share price/volume movements
- Company confirms compliance with ongoing disclosure obligations under SEBI LODR Regulation 30

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

The company reaffirms its commitment to making all relevant disclosures in compliance with Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and stock exchange agreements.

## Important Dates

- November 12, 2025: Date of news article publication on Economic Times
- November 12, 2025: Date of stock exchange queries (BSE Ref: L/SURV/ONL/RV/AA/(2025-2026)/84 and NSE Ref: NSE/CM/Surveillance/16065)

## Impact Assessment

This clarification has minimal market impact as it simply confirms that the battery storage news does not involve Adani Total Gas Limited. The circular is a routine response to stock exchange surveillance queries regarding news articles and price movements. Investors should note that the battery storage project mentioned in the news article relates to other Adani group entities, not ATGL. The company's core business remains city gas distribution.
