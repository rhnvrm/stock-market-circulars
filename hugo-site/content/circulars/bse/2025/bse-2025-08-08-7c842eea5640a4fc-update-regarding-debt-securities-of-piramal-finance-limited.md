title: Update Regarding Debt Securities of Piramal Finance Limited - Modified Coupon
  Step Up/Down and Mandatory Redemption Terms
---

## Summary

Piramal Finance Limited has updated the terms and conditions of its debt securities, modifying the coupon step up/down mechanism and mandatory redemption event triggers. The changes include revised rating thresholds for coupon adjustments and modified mandatory redemption criteria.

## Key Points

- Modified coupon step up mechanism with differentiated rates for different rating levels
- Changed mandatory redemption trigger from four notches to three notches rating downgrade
- Updated coupon step down provisions for rating upgrades
- Applies to existing debentures/NCDs of Piramal Finance Limited

## Regulatory Changes

**Coupon Step Up/Down Mechanism:**
- Previous: 0.25% increase per rating notch downgrade below AA rating
- Updated: 0.25% increase per notch from AA to A+, then 1.00% increase for downgrade from A+ to A
- Step down provisions similarly revised with 1.00% reduction for A to A+ upgrade and 0.25% per notch from A+ to AA

**Mandatory Redemption Event:**
- Previous trigger: Rating downgrade to four notches below current AA rating (i.e., A- or below)
- Updated trigger: Rating downgrade to three notches below current AA rating (i.e., A or below)

## Compliance Requirements

- Piramal Finance Limited must implement the revised coupon adjustment mechanism
- Updated terms apply to existing debt securities holders
- Most conservative rating among agencies to be considered for calculations
- Company must mandatorily redeem debentures if rating falls to A or below

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: As per the circular dated August 8, 2025
- Changes apply to existing debt securities immediately upon implementation

## Impact Assessment

**For Investors:**
- Enhanced protection through earlier mandatory redemption trigger (3 vs 4 notches)
- More nuanced coupon adjustment mechanism with higher penalties for lower ratings
- Improved risk management for bondholders

**For Piramal Finance:**
- Higher cost of borrowing if ratings deteriorate significantly
- Earlier redemption obligations in case of rating downgrades
- More stringent financial discipline required to maintain ratings
