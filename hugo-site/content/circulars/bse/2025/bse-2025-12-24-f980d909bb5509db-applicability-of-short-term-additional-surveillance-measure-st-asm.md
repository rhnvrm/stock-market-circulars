## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 26, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
The ST-ASM framework is designed to curb excessive speculation and protect investor interest in securities showing unusual price movements or volatility. Securities added to this framework will face enhanced surveillance which may:

- Reduce liquidity due to stricter trading conditions
- Require higher margins for trading
- Impact short-term trading strategies
- Alert investors to heightened risk profiles

**Operational Impact:**
Brokers and trading members need to:
- Update their systems to reflect new surveillance categorizations
- Communicate changes to clients holding or trading these securities
- Ensure margin and risk management systems are adjusted accordingly

**Investor Impact:**
Investors in the 8 newly added securities will face stricter trading conditions, while investors in the 21 securities being removed may see improved liquidity (unless moved to other restrictive frameworks like LT-ASM or ESM).
