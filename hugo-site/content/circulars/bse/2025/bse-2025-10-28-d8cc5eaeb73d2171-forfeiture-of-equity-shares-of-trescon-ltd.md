## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - The forfeiture affects a small number of shares relative to typical market volumes. The action is administrative in nature and relates to non-payment of call money by shareholders.

**Shareholder Impact:** Medium for affected shareholders - Loss of ownership rights and paid-up capital (Rs 250-500 per shareholder) for the 78 individuals listed. Shareholders include various individuals with surnames Shah, Barot, Gohil, Sodha, Panchal, Patel, Dave, Upadhyay, Gamit, and others.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal - Routine corporate action for capital restructuring. The company can now reissue these forfeited shares to raise additional capital or cancel them to reduce authorized capital.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible - The total number of shares forfeited (approximately 15,600) represents a very small fraction of typical daily trading volumes for listed companies.
