## Summary

Computer Age Management Services Ltd (Scrip Code: 543232) will sub-divide its equity shares in a 1:5 ratio, converting each existing equity share of Rs. 10/- face value into five equity shares of Rs. 2/- face value each. The record date for this sub-division is December 5, 2025.

## Key Points

- One equity share of Rs. 10/- face value will be split into five equity shares of Rs. 2/- face value each
- Sub-division ratio: 1:5
- Record date: December 5, 2025
- Effective date for new face value: December 5, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE596I01012) for Rs. 10/- shares will become invalid from December 5, 2025
- New ISIN for Rs. 2/- shares will be communicated via separate notice
- Notice reference: DR-771/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action undertaken by CAMS in accordance with existing regulations governing stock sub-divisions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that the existing ISIN INE596I01012 (Rs. 10/- paid-up value) will not be valid for transactions on or after December 5, 2025
- Members must await separate notice for the new ISIN number applicable to Rs. 2/- paid-up shares
- All trading and settlement systems must be updated to reflect the new share structure from December 5, 2025

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: December 5, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 5, 2025 (new Rs. 2/- face value becomes effective)
- **ISIN Validity**: Current ISIN INE596I01012 invalid from December 5, 2025
- **Notice Date**: November 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The stock sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the face value proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors. The market capitalization remains unchanged.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems, demat accounts, and portfolio management systems will need to reflect the new share structure. Shareholders will see their holdings multiplied by five with proportionally reduced face value per share.

**Trading Impact**: Share price will adjust proportionately (approximately 1/5th of pre-split price), making shares more accessible. Options and futures contracts will be adjusted accordingly as per exchange regulations.
