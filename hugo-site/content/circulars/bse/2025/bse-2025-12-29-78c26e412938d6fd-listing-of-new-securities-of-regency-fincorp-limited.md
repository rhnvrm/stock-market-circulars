## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. The preferential allotment represents a capital raising exercise through warrant conversion. The majority of shares (90.11%) are locked-in until June 30, 2026, and a smaller portion (9.89%) until June 30, 2027, which limits immediate supply in the market.

**Trading Impact:** Minimal immediate impact on trading volumes due to lock-in restrictions. The shares will trade under scrip code 540175 and can be identified by distribution numbers 69464709 to 73550870.

**Investor Consideration:** Existing shareholders should note the dilution from this preferential allotment. The lock-in period provides stability by preventing immediate liquidation by allottees.
