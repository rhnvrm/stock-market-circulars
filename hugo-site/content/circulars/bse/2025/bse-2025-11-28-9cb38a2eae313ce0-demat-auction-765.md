## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects 89 securities across multiple sectors. While this is a routine settlement mechanism, the large number of scrips and some significant quantities (particularly RIR POWER EL at 15,267 shares and SUPERTECH EV at 10,800 shares) may cause temporary price volatility in affected securities during auction.

**Operational Impact**: This auction resolves failed delivery obligations and ensures market integrity. Members with short positions must arrange for securities or participate in the auction at potentially unfavorable prices, which serves as a deterrent against delivery failures.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders of affected companies may observe temporary price movements on the auction date. The auction mechanism ensures that all trades are ultimately settled, protecting market integrity.
