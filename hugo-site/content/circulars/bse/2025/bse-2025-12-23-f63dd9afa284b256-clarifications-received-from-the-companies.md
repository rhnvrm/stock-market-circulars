  1. Increase in Authorised Share Capital from ₹15 Crore to ₹100 Crore with consequential MOA amendment
  2. Alteration of Object Clause in Memorandum of Association by adding new objects
- **Clarification**: No other UPSI or pending announcements beyond already disclosed EGM matters

## Regulatory Context

- Both responses comply with BSE surveillance queries under market monitoring framework

- Standard surveillance procedure when exchanges detect unusual trading patterns

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies must respond promptly to stock exchange surveillance queries
- Companies must disclose any material events or UPSI that could affect security prices
