title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Movement of Securities Across Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework effective November 17, 2025. The circular identifies 6 securities being newly added to ESM, 1 security moving to a higher ESM stage, 14 securities moving to lower ESM stages, and 24 securities being removed from the framework entirely. The ESM framework is designed to alert investors about securities witnessing unusual price movements and is applied in various stages with progressively stringent surveillance measures.

## Key Points

- 6 securities newly shortlisted for ESM framework: Adinath Textiles, Gretex Corporate Services, Shahi Shipping, Suryo Foods & Industries, Svarnim Trade Udyog, and U. Y. Fincorp
- 1 security (Bisil Plast Ltd) moving to higher ESM stage indicating increased surveillance
- 14 securities moving to lower ESM stages showing improvement in trading patterns
- 24 securities being removed from ESM framework completely
- All changes effective from November 17, 2025
- Some securities moving out are transitioning to SMP (Surveillance Measure with Price Band) Framework instead

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework continues to operate with multi-stage surveillance levels. Securities are evaluated based on trading patterns, price movements, and market behavior. Movement between stages occurs based on ongoing monitoring, with higher stages indicating greater concern and lower stages or removal indicating normalization of trading activity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the ESM classification changes for affected securities
- Trading members should inform their clients about ESM applicability on these securities
- Investors should be aware that ESM securities may have additional margin requirements and trading restrictions
- Special attention required for securities moving to higher ESM stages due to heightened surveillance

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 17, 2025 - All ESM framework changes come into effect

## Impact Assessment

**Securities Added to ESM (6 stocks)**: These will face enhanced scrutiny and potential trading restrictions including higher margins, trade-for-trade settlement, or price bands. Liquidity may be impacted negatively.

**Securities Moving to Higher Stage (1 stock)**: Bisil Plast Ltd faces increased surveillance measures, indicating continued concern about trading patterns. This typically results in stricter trading conditions.

**Securities Moving to Lower Stage (14 stocks)**: Positive development indicating improved trading behavior and reduced risk concerns. These securities will have relatively relaxed surveillance measures while still remaining under watch.

**Securities Removed from ESM (24 stocks)**: Significant positive development as these securities have normalized their trading patterns. However, some are transitioning to SMP framework which also involves surveillance measures. Complete removal from all frameworks would allow normal trading conditions to resume.
