The record date for this corporate action is December 2, 2025, and the new paid-up value will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Company: Mini Diamonds India Ltd (Scrip Code: 523373)
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Sub-division Ratio: 1:5 (One share of Rs.10/- into Five shares of Rs.2/-)
- Record Date: December 2, 2025
- Effective Date for New Paid-up Value: December 2, 2025
- Current ISIN: INE281E01010 (Rs.10/- paid up) - will become invalid from December 2, 2025

- Segment: Equity - Dematerialised Securities (Rolling Settlement)
- Notice Number: DR-768/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action under existing BSE regulations for stock sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that the existing ISIN INE281E01010 (Rs.10/- face value) will not be valid for transactions on or after December 2, 2025
- Members must await separate notice for the new ISIN number for Rs.2/- paid-up shares
- All trading systems and records must be updated to reflect the new share structure post the effective date
- Shareholders do not need to take any action as the sub-division will be processed automatically in demat accounts

## Important Dates

- **November 18, 2025**: Notice issued by BSE
- **December 2, 2025**: Record date for sub-division
- **December 2, 2025**: Effective date for new Rs.2/- paid-up value
- **December 2, 2025**: Old ISIN INE281E01010 becomes invalid for exchange transactions

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive five shares for every one share held as of the record date. The total value of holdings remains unchanged, but the number of shares increases proportionately.

**Trading Impact**: The stock price will adjust proportionately to reflect the 1:5 split. A stock trading at Rs.50 would theoretically trade at Rs.10 post-split, making shares more affordable and potentially improving liquidity.

**Market Impact**: Stock sub-divisions typically aim to improve liquidity by making shares more affordable to retail investors. The action may attract increased trading interest due to lower absolute share prices.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN and face value. The transition date of December 2, 2025 is critical for system updates.
