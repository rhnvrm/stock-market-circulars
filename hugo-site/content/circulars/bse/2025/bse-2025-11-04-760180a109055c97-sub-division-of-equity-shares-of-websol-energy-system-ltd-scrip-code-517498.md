Each existing equity share with face value of Rs. 10/- will be subdivided into 10 equity shares of Re. 1/- each. The old ISIN INE855C01015 will become invalid for exchange transactions from November 14, 2025, and a new ISIN for Re. 1/- paid-up shares will be notified separately.

## Key Points

- Effective Date: November 14, 2025
- Notice Number: 20251104-65 (DR-756/2025-2026)
- Segment: Dematerialised Securities - Rolling Settlement

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- No transactions using old ISIN will be permitted on or after November 14, 2025

## Important Dates

- **November 4, 2025**: Notice issued by BSE
- **November 14, 2025**: Record date for sub-division
- **November 14, 2025**: Effective date for new face value and trading with new ISIN
- **November 14, 2025**: Old ISIN becomes invalid for exchange transactions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The 1:10 stock split will increase the number of outstanding shares tenfold while proportionally reducing the share price. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors by lowering the per-share price.

**Operational Impact**: Investors and trading systems must be updated to reflect the new share count and face value. The ISIN change requires coordination between depositories, brokers, and trading platforms to ensure seamless transition.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their holding quantity increase by 10 times while maintaining the same total investment value. No action is required from shareholders as the subdivision is automatic, but they should verify their updated holdings post-record date and ensure their systems reflect the new ISIN for future transactions.
