## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers and intermediaries must ensure proper surveillance and prevent misuse of client order information

## Impact Assessment

**Market Integrity Impact:** This enforcement action demonstrates SEBI's commitment to maintaining market integrity by prosecuting front running activities. Front running undermines investor confidence and creates unfair advantages for those with access to privileged trading information.

**Deterrent Effect:** The comprehensive proceedings against 30 entities (including settlement with 6 and continued action against 24) sends a strong message about consequences of fraudulent trading practices.

**Investor Protection:** The order protects interests of large institutional clients (family trusts in this case) whose trading strategies can be compromised by front running activities.

**Regulatory Precedent:** This case establishes important precedents regarding:
- Application of settlement proceedings in multi-party front running cases
- Evidentiary requirements for establishing front running
- Technical procedural requirements for enforcement actions

**Industry Impact:** Market intermediaries, brokers, and traders must strengthen internal controls and surveillance mechanisms to prevent unauthorized use of client order information.
