Key changes include replacing "arbitration" with "dispute resolution mechanism" in misconduct rules, updating fee references accordingly, and modifying the authority for trade annulment decisions from Board/Managing Director to authorized persons/committees.

## Key Points

- Bye-law 5(b) Chapter VII removes Board/Managing Director from trade annulment authority, delegates to authorized persons/committees
- Bye-law 5(e) Chapter VII maintains Independent Oversight Committee review process for trade annulment decisions
