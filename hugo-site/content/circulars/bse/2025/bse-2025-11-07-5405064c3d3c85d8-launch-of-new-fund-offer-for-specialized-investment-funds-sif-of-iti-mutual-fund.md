## Impact Assessment

Low market impact. This is a routine NFO launch for a specialized investment fund scheme that provides investors with an additional investment option in the equity long-short category. The launch follows standard BSE StAR MF Platform procedures and does not affect existing market operations or trading mechanisms. Impact is limited to ITI Mutual Fund distributors and investors interested in specialized investment funds with long-short equity strategies.
