These shares were issued at Rs. 11.76 per share (face value Rs. 10) pursuant to an order from the Hon'ble Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) on preferential basis to promoters.

## Key Points

- 1,70,06,802 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each issued at Rs. 11.76 per share
- Issued pursuant to BIFR order to promoters on preferential basis
- Date of allotment: October 13, 2016

- Distinctive Numbers: 61781341 to 78788142
- Majority of shares subject to lock-in restrictions

No regulatory changes introduced by this circular. This is a routine listing notification for securities issued under BIFR restructuring provisions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Lock-in restrictions must be observed as per the specified schedule
- Securities to be identified by distinctive numbers and ISIN for trading purposes

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: October 13, 2016
- **Trading Effective Date**: December 03, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry (92.65% shares)**: June 30, 2027 (1,57,57,629 shares, Distinctive Nos. 61781341-77538969)
- **Lock-in Expiry (7.35% shares)**: June 30, 2026 (12,49,173 shares, Distinctive Nos. 77538970-78788142)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The listing adds significant volume (1.7 crore shares) to the traded stock, but the immediate market impact is mitigated by lock-in restrictions. Approximately 92.65% of the newly listed shares are locked-in until June 2027, and the remaining 7.35% until June 2026.

**Company Impact**: The shares were issued as part of a BIFR restructuring, indicating the company underwent financial rehabilitation. The preferential allotment to promoters at Rs. 11.76 (premium of Rs. 1.76 over face value) represents capital infusion as part of the revival plan.

**Investor Consideration**: Investors should note the substantial locked-in shareholding that will become available for trading in 2026-2027, which could impact stock liquidity and price dynamics when restrictions expire.
