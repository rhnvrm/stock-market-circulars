## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to medium. Share sub-division is a technical adjustment that increases the number of shares while proportionally reducing the face value. This makes shares more affordable for retail investors and improves liquidity.

**Operational Impact:** Medium for trading members and depositories who must update their systems with the new ISIN. Shareholders will see doubled quantity of shares with proportionally adjusted price.

**Investor Impact:** Neutral to positive. Existing shareholders will receive twice the number of shares at half the face value, maintaining their total investment value. Lower price per share may attract more retail participation and improve trading volumes.
