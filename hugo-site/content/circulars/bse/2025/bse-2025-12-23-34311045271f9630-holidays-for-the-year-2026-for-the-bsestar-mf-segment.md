## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Market participants need to adjust transaction processing, settlement schedules, and client communication around these holidays. The advance notice allows adequate planning time.

**Market Impact:** Low - These are scheduled closures with no trading on BSEStAR MF platform. No unexpected disruptions anticipated.

**Planning Requirement:** MFIs, MFDs, RIAs, and RFDs should incorporate these dates into their 2026 operational calendars and inform clients about service availability on these dates. The concentration of several holidays in March-April, May-June, and October-November periods requires particular attention for transaction planning.
