The Board of Directors approved this extension in a meeting held on December 13, 2025 to provide shareholders additional time to exercise their rights. The Rights Issue originally opened on November 24, 2025.

## Key Points

- Last date for submission of Common Application Form (CAF) with payment is now December 23, 2025
- Board meeting held on December 13, 2025 from 1:00 PM to 1:15 PM approved the extension
- No changes to Letter of Offer (LOF) or CAF except closing date and post-issue timeline
- Issue originally opened on November 24, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a procedural extension of an existing rights issue timeline.

## Compliance Requirements

- Shareholders entitled to the Rights Issue must submit duly filled Common Application Form (CAF) along with application amount by December 23, 2025
- Shareholders should note the revised Issue Closing Date of December 23, 2025

## Important Dates

**Revised Issue Schedule:**

- **Issue Opening Date:** Monday, November 24, 2025
- **Last Date for On-Market Renunciation:** Wednesday, December 03, 2025
- **Last Date for Off-Market Transfer of Rights Entitlements:** Monday, December 22, 2025
- **Issue Closing Date:** Tuesday, December 23, 2025 (extended from December 15, 2025)
- **Basis of Allotment Finalization:** Wednesday, December 24, 2025

- **Credit of Right Equity Shares:** Friday, December 26, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact:** Positive for shareholders as the extension provides additional time (8 days) to arrange funds and exercise their rights in the Rights Issue. This reduces the risk of shareholders missing the deadline due to time constraints.

**Market Impact:** Minimal market impact. The extension is a procedural change that does not alter the fundamental terms of the Rights Issue. Post-issue activities including allotment and listing dates have been pushed back proportionally.

**Operational Impact:** The extension shifts all post-issue activities by approximately 8 days, with the new expected listing date being December 29, 2025 instead of the earlier anticipated date.
