---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 12 equity securities effective December 23, 2025. The revised bands range from 2% to 20%, representing tighter trading limits compared to standard price bands. This measure is part of BSE's surveillance framework to control excessive volatility in these securities.

## Key Points

- 12 securities subject to revised price bands effective December 23, 2025
- Price bands set at 2%, 5%, or 20% depending on the security
- Helloji Holidays Ltd has the widest band at 20%
- Four securities (Gujarat Investa, Hemo Organic, Shree Krishna Paper Mills, Unipro Technologies) restricted to 2% band
- Seven securities have 5% price band
- Changes apply to equity segment trading
- Clarifications can be sent to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This circular implements existing surveillance measures through price band adjustments to manage volatility and market integrity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure all orders and trades comply with revised price bands from December 23, 2025
- Orders exceeding the revised price bands will be rejected by the trading system
- Members should inform clients about the revised price limits for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 22, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 23, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revised price bands will significantly restrict intraday price movements for these 12 securities. Securities with 2% bands will see severely limited volatility, potentially reducing trading volumes and liquidity. The 20% band on Helloji Holidays suggests either recent listing or specific volatility concerns.

**Trading Impact**: Day traders and momentum traders will face constraints in these securities. Options strategies and derivatives (if available) may be affected. Investors should expect reduced price discovery efficiency during volatile market conditions.
