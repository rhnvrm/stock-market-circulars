## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium impact on market participants with international operations. The removal of four countries from increased monitoring may ease compliance requirements and potentially facilitate smoother business operations with entities in Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, and South Africa. Members dealing with these jurisdictions should update their due diligence and risk assessment frameworks accordingly. No new jurisdictions being added to monitoring is a stable outcome requiring no additional enhanced scrutiny measures.
