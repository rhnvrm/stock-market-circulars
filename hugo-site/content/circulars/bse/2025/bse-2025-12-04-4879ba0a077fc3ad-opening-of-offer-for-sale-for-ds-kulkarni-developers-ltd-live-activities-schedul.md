- **Settlement Day**: T+1 for institutional/non-institutional; T+2 for retail/employees

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to DS Kulkarni Developers Ltd and interested investors. The relatively small offer size of 5 lakh shares and low floor price of Rs 10 suggests modest market impact.

**Investor Categories Affected**:
- Retail investors (up to Rs 2 lakh bid value) have dedicated reservation and later bidding window
- Employees have separate category with bid limit up to Rs 5 lakhs
- Institutional and non-institutional investors bid first on T Day
- Unallocated bidders can carry forward bids to subsequent day

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and custodians need to facilitate client participation through specified platforms (iBBS, RTRMS) and ensure proper margin collection based on investor categories. The staggered bidding schedule (institutional first, retail second) allows for measured participation.
