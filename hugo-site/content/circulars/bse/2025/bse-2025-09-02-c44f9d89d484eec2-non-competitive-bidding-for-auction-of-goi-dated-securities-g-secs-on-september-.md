The Reserve Bank of India has announced an auction of two Government of India dated securities scheduled for September 4, 2025. BSE is facilitating non-competitive bidding for these securities through its iBBS web-based platform, allowing trading members and direct investors to participate in the government securities auction.

## Key Points

- Two G-Secs being auctioned: 6.28% GS 2032 (Re-issue, ₹11,000 Cr) and 7.09% GS 2074 (Re-issue, ₹14,000 Cr)
- Non-competitive bidding available through BSE's iBBS platform (https://ibbs.bseindia.com)
- Minimum subscription: 100 units (₹10,000)
- Maximum subscription: ₹2 crores per security
- Settlement date: September 8, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This follows the existing framework established in BSE circular no. 20180423-42 dated April 23, 2018 regarding non-competitive bidding facility for Government Securities auctions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the NCB-GSec module on BSE's iBBS platform for bidding
- Members can submit bids until September 4, 2025, 8:00 AM
- Direct investors must submit bids by September 3, 2025, 5:00 PM

- Maximum bid limit: ₹2 crores per security

## Important Dates

- **Bid Collection Start**: September 2, 2025, 10:00 AM (24-hour availability)
- **Bid Collection End (Direct Investors)**: September 3, 2025, 5:00 PM
- **Bid Collection End (Members)**: September 4, 2025, 8:00 AM
- **Auction Date**: September 4, 2025
- **Settlement Date**: September 8, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is a routine government securities auction. The total issue size of ₹25,000 crores (₹11,000 Cr + ₹14,000 Cr) represents standard government borrowing activity. The non-competitive bidding facility provides retail and small institutional investors access to government securities at weighted average auction prices, promoting broader market participation in sovereign debt instruments.
