## Important Dates

- **December 2, 2025**: Media article published in Economic Times regarding layoffs

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The clarification addresses media speculation and provides transparency on organizational changes. Since the 15% workforce reduction was previously announced in April 2024, this circular does not introduce new material information but provides context to recent media reports following the failed Sony merger.

**Operational Impact**: The company explicitly states that the workforce optimization has no impact on operations or performance, suggesting business continuity is maintained during the restructuring process.

**Investor Sentiment**: The clarification may help address concerns raised by media reports by positioning the workforce rationalization as a strategic business optimization rather than a distress measure, though the reference to the failed Sony merger in the news headline may continue to influence sentiment.

**Corporate Governance**: The circular demonstrates the company's commitment to transparency and compliance with disclosure obligations under SEBI LODR regulations by promptly addressing market rumors and providing factual information to stakeholders.
