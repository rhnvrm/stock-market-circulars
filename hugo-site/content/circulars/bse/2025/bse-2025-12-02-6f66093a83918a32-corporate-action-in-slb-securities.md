## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High impact on SLB market operations for the three affected securities. Market participants must compulsorily close their lending and borrowing positions before the foreclosure dates, which may create temporary liquidity pressures and increased trading activity in these securities.

**Operational Impact:** Clearing members and participants need to actively manage their SLB portfolios and ensure timely closure of positions. The shut periods will temporarily reduce available inventory for securities lending, potentially affecting short-selling strategies and hedging activities.

**Investor Impact:** Investors using SLB mechanisms for these securities must be aware of the mandatory closure requirements. Failure to close positions by foreclosure dates may result in penalties or forced settlements. The corporate actions themselves (spin-off, rights issue, dividend) will also impact shareholders' holdings and entitlements based on record dates.
