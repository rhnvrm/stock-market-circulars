## Impact Assessment

### Market Impact: Low

The delisting offer for Manphool Exports Limited has limited market-wide impact as:

1. **Limited Exchange Listing**: The company is only listed on Calcutta Stock Exchange, not on BSE's main trading platform
2. **Small Offer Size**: The offer involves only 5,90,070 equity shares
3. **Company-Specific Event**: This is a voluntary delisting affecting only existing shareholders of MEL
4. **Low Floor Price**: At Rs. 6.00 per share, the total offer value is approximately Rs. 35.4 lakhs, indicating a small-cap delisting

### Operational Impact: Medium

For trading members and custodians handling MEL shareholders:
- Requires coordination with clients holding MEL shares
- Technical setup needed to access OTB platforms (iBBS, RTRMS)
- UCC database updates may be required
- Time-bound activity requiring attention during the 6-day offer period
