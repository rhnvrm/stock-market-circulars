## Summary

BSE received clarifications from three companies - NRB Bearings (Scrip Code: 530367), Wockhardt Limited, and Bandaram Pharma Packtech Limited - in response to exchange queries about significant volume movements in their securities. All three companies confirmed they have no undisclosed information that would have a bearing on price/volume movements and are compliant with SEBI Listing Regulations.

## Key Points

- **NRB Bearings** responded to BSE email ref L/SURV/ONL/PV/APJ/2025-2026/719 regarding volume increase across exchanges
- **Wockhardt Limited** responded to BSE email ref L/SURV/ONL/PV/APJ/2025-2026/717 regarding volume movement
- **Bandaram Pharma Packtech** responded to BSE email ref L/SURV/ONL/PV/APJ/2025-2026/716 regarding price movement
- All companies confirmed regular compliance with Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015
- No price-sensitive information pending disclosure identified by any company
- NRB Bearings referenced their December 1, 2025 disclosure about Joint Venture with Italian bearing manufacturer Unitec (Mondial Group)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This circular documents routine surveillance activities under existing SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must respond to stock exchange surveillance queries regarding abnormal price/volume movements
- Companies must confirm whether any undisclosed material information exists that could impact securities trading
- Ongoing obligation to disclose material events under Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015
- Companies must review internal records and operations before responding to exchange queries

## Important Dates

- **December 2, 2025**: Date of clarifications submitted by all three companies
- **December 1, 2025**: NRB Bearings disclosed Joint Venture with Unitec (referenced in their clarification)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. These are routine clarification responses to exchange surveillance queries with no new material information disclosed.

**Operational Impact**: None. Companies confirmed normal operations and compliance with disclosure requirements.

**Investor Impact**: Low. Investors are informed that volume/price movements are market-driven with no undisclosed corporate developments. NRB Bearings' reference to their recent Joint Venture announcement suggests this may have driven their volume increase, but this information was already publicly disclosed on December 1, 2025.

**Regulatory Significance**: Demonstrates active surveillance by BSE to ensure market integrity and timely disclosure of material information.
