**For Shareholders**: Existing shareholders as of the record date will be entitled to subscribe to the rights issue at a ratio of 23:49. The rights shares are priced at Rs. 191, representing a significant premium of Rs. 181 over the face value, which suggests the company values its equity at a premium.

**For Trading**: From October 14, 2025, all trading in the scrip will occur on an ex-rights basis, meaning buyers will not be entitled to participate in the rights issue. This typically affects the stock price as it adjusts for the value of the rights entitlement.

**For Market Operations**: The ex-rights adjustment ensures proper settlement and prevents disputes regarding rights entitlement between buyers and sellers during the record date period.
