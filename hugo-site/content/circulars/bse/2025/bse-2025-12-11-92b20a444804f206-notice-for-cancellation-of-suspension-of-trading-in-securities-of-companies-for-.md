## Impact Assessment

**Positive Market Impact**: The cancellation of trading suspension allows shareholders of both companies to resume trading their securities, restoring liquidity and market access. This demonstrates that both companies have rectified their compliance deficiencies under SEBI LODR Regulations. The medium impact rating reflects that while this is significant for affected shareholders and the companies involved, it involves only two entities with specific scrip codes and does not represent a broader market-wide change. Investors in these securities can now execute buy/sell orders starting December 15, 2025.
