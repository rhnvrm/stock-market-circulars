title: Revise and Revamp of Nomination Facilities in Mutual Funds Segment - Update
---

## Summary

SEBI has mandated that all mutual fund investors must either designate a nominee or formally opt-out of nomination for their investments. This applies to both existing and new investors. The opt-out process requires OTP-based two-factor authentication along with either a signed declaration or video verification. Members must generate and maintain a unique reference number for opt-out documentation. From December 15, 2025, transactions for fresh folio creation under non-demat mode without proper nomination compliance will be rejected at AMC/RTA level.
