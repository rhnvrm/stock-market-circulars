- Debt market participants and institutional investors who may trade these securities
- Existing investors in Finkurve Financial Services Limited

The securities carry a CRISIL BBB/Stable rating, indicating moderate credit quality with adequate capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.

The monthly interest payment structure provides regular income to investors.
