title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective December 01, 2025. Six securities are being added to the ST-ASM framework, while eight securities are moving out. The circular provides consolidated lists of all securities under ST-ASM surveillance with their respective stages.

## Key Points

- 6 securities shortlisted for ST-ASM framework including Best Agrolife Ltd, Gilada Finance & Investments Ltd, Halder Venture Ltd, JD Cables Ltd, Srigee Dlm Ltd, and Supertech Ev Ltd
- 3 of the newly added securities are SME scrips (JD Cables Ltd, Srigee Dlm Ltd, Supertech Ev Ltd)
- 8 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework: Garnet International Ltd, Magellanic Cloud Ltd, Parmeshwar Metal Ltd, Regal Entertainment & Consultants Ltd, Universal Cables Ltd, Venus Remedies Ltd, VL E-Governance & IT Solutions Ltd, and VLS Finance Ltd
- Securities moving out are being included in other surveillance frameworks: LT-ASM (Magellanic Cloud Ltd), ESM (Regal Entertainment & Consultants Ltd, Venus Remedies Ltd), or exiting surveillance
- No securities moving to higher or lower stages within ST-ASM framework
- Consolidated list shows securities across multiple stages (I through VII) with varying ASM levels

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities exhibiting unusual price movements or volatility. Securities in this framework are subject to:

- Short term surveillance periods (5/15/30 days)
- Staged approach with progressive restrictions
- Special monitoring for SME scrips and T+0 securities
- Potential migration to other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM, GSM, Trade for Trade, Pledge Framework)

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the securities under ST-ASM surveillance
- Trading members should implement appropriate risk management for securities in ST-ASM framework
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance status when trading affected securities
- Special attention required for SME scrips marked with @ symbol
- Compliance with stage-specific restrictions as applicable

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 01, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable
- **Circular Date**: November 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The ST-ASM framework directly impacts trading liquidity and investor participation in affected securities. Addition of 6 securities (including 3 SME scrips) will subject them to enhanced surveillance and potential trading restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading securities moving into ST-ASM must be prepared for increased monitoring, potential price bands, and reduced liquidity. The framework aims to protect investors from excessive volatility.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the surveillance status changes. Securities moving out to other frameworks (ESM, LT-ASM) will be subject to different restriction mechanisms.

**Migration Significance**: The movement of securities to LT-ASM or ESM frameworks indicates continued surveillance concerns, while those exiting without migration may indicate improved stability metrics.
