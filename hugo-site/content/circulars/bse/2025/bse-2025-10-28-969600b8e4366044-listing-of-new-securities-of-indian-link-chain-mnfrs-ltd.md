## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the listing of these new securities

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment to Non Promoters represents capital raising activity by the company. The lock-in period until May 31, 2026 ensures these shares cannot be traded freely for approximately 7 months from the listing date, limiting immediate liquidity impact. The shares will rank equally with existing equity shares in terms of rights and privileges.
