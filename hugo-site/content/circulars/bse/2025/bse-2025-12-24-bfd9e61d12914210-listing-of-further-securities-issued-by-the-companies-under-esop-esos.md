**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing involves a relatively small quantity of shares (73,260) issued under employee stock option schemes. The lock-in period of approximately one month ensures these shares will not immediately impact market liquidity or trading volumes.

**Stakeholder Impact**: Affects employees who have been allotted shares under ESOP/ESOS schemes. These shareholders will need to wait until January 17, 2026 before they can trade their allotted shares.

**Compliance Impact**: Standard compliance requirement for companies issuing shares under employee stock option schemes. No additional burden beyond existing ESOP/ESOS regulations.
