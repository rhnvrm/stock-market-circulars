  18, 2025
---

## Summary

ACE Software Exports Limited (BSE Code: 531525) has extended the closing date of its Rights Issue by 3 days to Thursday, December 18, 2025, from the originally scheduled Monday, December 15, 2025. The Fund-raising Committee of the Board approved this extension based on feedback from multiple shareholders to provide greater operational convenience and enable seamless participation. The extension keeps the total issue period within the regulatory limit of 30 days from the Issue Opening Date.

## Key Points

- Extension based on feedback from multiple shareholders
- Issue Opening Date remains unchanged at November 28, 2025
- Last date for on-market renunciation of Rights Entitlements remains December 10, 2025
- Total issue period still within 30-day regulatory limit
- Newspaper advertisement regarding revised schedule to be published
- Decision made by Fund-raising Committee of the Board of Directors

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a procedural extension of the Rights Issue timeline within permitted regulatory parameters under SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- Company to publish advertisement regarding revised schedule in newspapers
- Revised schedule advertisement to be submitted to stock exchange
- Information made available on company website (www.acesoftex.com)

## Important Dates

- **Issue Opening Date**: Friday, November 28, 2025 (Unchanged)
- **Last Date for On Market Renunciation of Rights Entitlements**: Wednesday, December 10, 2025 (Unchanged)
- **Issue Closing Date**: Thursday, December 18, 2025 (Extended from December 15, 2025)

## Impact Assessment

**For Shareholders**: The 3-day extension provides additional time for existing shareholders to subscribe to their rights entitlements without time constraints, improving participation opportunities. Shareholders who missed the original deadline now have until December 18, 2025, to apply.

**For Market Operations**: The extension delays the allotment, credit, and listing of rights shares by 3 days. The listing is now expected on December 23, 2025, instead of December 18, 2025. However, the renunciation period remains unchanged, so investors who wanted to trade rights entitlements on the market cannot benefit from additional time.

**Overall Impact**: Medium impact—beneficial for shareholders seeking more time to participate, with minimal disruption to overall market operations as the extension is modest and within regulatory parameters.
