This is a routine listing announcement with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment increases the equity base by 2,835,150 shares, representing capital infusion of approximately Rs. 242.5 crores (at issue price of Rs. 855/-). However, all shares are locked-in until May 30, 2026, preventing immediate trading and limiting short-term liquidity impact. The announcement affects only RIR Power Electronics Limited and has no broader market implications.
