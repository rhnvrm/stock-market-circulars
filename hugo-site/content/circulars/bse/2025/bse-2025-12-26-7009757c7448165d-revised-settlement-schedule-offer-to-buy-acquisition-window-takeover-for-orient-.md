## Impact Assessment

This revision provides significant additional time for members and custodians to fulfill their settlement obligations from the 2019 takeover offer. The extension to December 31, 2026 suggests potential complications or delays in the original settlement process. Members holding unsettled positions from this acquisition window now have until end of 2026 to complete their obligations. The restriction to Early Pay-in mechanism ensures proper tracking and security of share delivery for this extended settlement period.
