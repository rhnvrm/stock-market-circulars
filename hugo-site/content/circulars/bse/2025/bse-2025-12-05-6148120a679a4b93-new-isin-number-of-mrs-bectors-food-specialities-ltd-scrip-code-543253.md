- New Face Value: Rs.2/- per share
- Ex-Date: December 12, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action notification regarding share sub-division and consequent ISIN change as per existing SEBI guidelines for share capital restructuring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number INE495P01020
- The new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on or after the ex-date of December 12, 2025
- All post-split shares will carry the new face value of Rs.2/- per share
- Market participants should ensure proper record-keeping and reconciliation during the transition

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 5, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Neutral to positive. Share sub-division typically improves liquidity by making shares more affordable to retail investors. The 5:1 split ratio (Rs.10 to Rs.2) significantly reduces the per-share price, potentially broadening the investor base.

**Operational Impact**: Medium. Trading members and market infrastructure providers need to update their systems with the new ISIN and ensure smooth transition on the ex-date. Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares of Rs.2/- face value for every 1 share of Rs.10/- face value held.

**Investor Impact**: No change to total investment value or ownership percentage. Only the number of shares and price per share will be adjusted proportionally. Investors should verify that their demat accounts reflect the correct post-split share quantity after the ex-date.
