## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The listing of only 500 equity shares represents a very small addition to the company's existing equity capital. The conversion from partly paid to fully paid shares is a standard corporate process. Trading members can accommodate these shares in their normal trading operations without any significant operational changes. The pari-passu status ensures these shares have identical rights to existing shares, maintaining uniformity in shareholder treatment.
