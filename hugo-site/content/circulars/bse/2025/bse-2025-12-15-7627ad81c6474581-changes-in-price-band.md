## Regulatory Changes

Price bands are surveillance tools used by exchanges to control excessive volatility in securities. The revision of price bands from existing levels indicates updated risk assessment for these securities. Tighter bands (2%, 5%) indicate higher surveillance, while wider bands (20%) may indicate high volatility or special circumstances.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their trading systems to reflect new price bands
- Systems must be configured before market opening on December 16, 2025
- Any clarifications required should be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Members must ensure proper risk management systems are in place for these securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 15, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 16, 2025
- Changes apply from market opening on the effective date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The revised price bands will affect daily trading ranges for these 16 securities. Tighter bands will limit intraday price movements, potentially reducing volatility but also liquidity. Wider bands for securities like Ranjit Securities Ltd and SSMD Agrotech India Ltd (20%) indicate higher volatility expectations.

**Trading Impact:** Traders and investors in these securities need to adjust their strategies according to new price limits. Stop-loss orders and limit orders should be reviewed. Algorithmic trading systems must be recalibrated to account for new band limits.

**Surveillance Rationale:** The varying levels of price bands suggest differentiated surveillance based on individual security characteristics, trading patterns, and risk profiles.
