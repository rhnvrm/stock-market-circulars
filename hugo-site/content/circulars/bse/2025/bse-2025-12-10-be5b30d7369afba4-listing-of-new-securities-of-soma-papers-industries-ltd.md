## Important Dates

- **Lock-In Expiry Date**: June 30, 2026 (applies to all allotted shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The listing of 11.4 crore new shares represents significant equity dilution for existing shareholders. The extent of dilution depends on the pre-listing share capital.

**Trading Impact**: The 18-month lock-in period (until June 30, 2026) will restrict supply of these shares in the secondary market during this period, potentially supporting price stability.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will experience ownership dilution. The lock-in period provides certainty that these shares will not create immediate selling pressure in the market.
