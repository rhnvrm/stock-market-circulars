## Summary

BSE has announced that the equity shares of OM Metallogic Limited (Scrip Code: 544559) will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to the Rolling segment (M Group) effective October 23, 2025. This follows the company's SME IPO listing and represents a transition to normal trading operations.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for OM Metallogic Limited shares will change from Trade for Trade basis to Rolling settlement. This is a standard progression for SME IPO listings after the initial trading period, allowing for normal continuous trading with T+2 settlement instead of matched trades requiring full upfront payment and delivery.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the group change from MT to M Group
- Trading members should contact BSE for clarification if needed regarding the transition
- Members need to ensure compliance with Rolling segment trading requirements effective October 23, 2025

- **October 7, 2025**: Current notice date confirming the change
- **October 23, 2025**: Effective date for transfer to Rolling segment (M Group)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The shift from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment will increase liquidity and trading flexibility for OM Metallogic shares, potentially attracting more market participants.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members will need to adjust their trading strategies and settlement processes. The change enables intraday trading, short selling (subject to regulations), and standard T+2 settlement cycles, making the stock more accessible to retail and institutional investors.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for investors as Rolling segment provides better price discovery, improved liquidity, and standard settlement mechanisms compared to the restrictive Trade for Trade segment.
