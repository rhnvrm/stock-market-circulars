The suspension is due to the company setting a record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debenture series from the suspension date.

## Key Points

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are required to take note of this suspension and inform their clients accordingly
- All trading activity in this debenture series must cease from the specified date

- **November 21, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 27, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **November 27, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of this specific NCD series (LMPL-13.79%-12-12-25-PVT). The trading suspension is a standard procedure before debenture redemption and ensures orderly settlement. Debenture holders will receive their principal redemption amount and final interest payment as per the record date. No trading is permitted from November 27, 2025, which prevents any confusion regarding entitlement to redemption proceeds. This is a routine corporate action with minimal broader market impact.
