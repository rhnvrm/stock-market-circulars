**Operational Impact**: High for the concerned IA - The order under Section 12(3) may lead to suspension or cancellation of registration, affecting the IA's ability to continue business operations and serve existing clients.

**Investor Impact**: Medium - Clients of this Investment Adviser may face disruption in advisory services and will need to identify alternative advisers if registration is suspended or cancelled.
