## Impact Assessment

This is a routine market operation to ensure settlement of delivery defaults. The impact is limited to brokers/clearing members who failed to deliver securities and must now procure them through auction. The wide range of securities (106 scrips) indicates multiple delivery failures across the market. Large quantity auctions like STANDARD CAP (25000), ATAL REALTECH (12500), and AMRAWORLD AG (6540) may experience temporary price volatility during the auction process.
