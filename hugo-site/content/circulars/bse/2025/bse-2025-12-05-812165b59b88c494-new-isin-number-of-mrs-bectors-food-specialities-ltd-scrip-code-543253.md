## Summary

BSE has issued a notice regarding the allocation of a new ISIN number for MRS. Bectors Food Specialities Ltd (Scrip Code: 543253) following the sub-division of equity shares. The new ISIN number INE495P01020 will be effective for equity shares of Rs.2/- each, replacing the previous denomination of Rs.10/- per share. This change is in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251120-48 dated November 20, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: MRS. Bectors Food Specialities Ltd
- BSE Scrip Code: 543253
- New ISIN Number: INE495P01020
- Share Sub-Division: From Rs.10/- per share to Rs.2/- per share
- Ex-Date: December 12, 2025
- Document Reference: DR-776/2025-2026
- Notice Number: 20251205-7

## Regulatory Changes

The ISIN (International Securities Identification Number) for MRS. Bectors Food Specialities Ltd will change to INE495P01020 to reflect the new face value of Rs.2/- per equity share. This is a standard procedure following corporate actions involving share sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must note the new ISIN number for all trades executed on or after the ex-date
- All systems and records must be updated to reflect the new ISIN INE495P01020 for trades from December 12, 2025 onwards
- The change applies specifically to trades done on and from the ex-date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 5, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: December 12, 2025 (effective date for new ISIN number)
- **Reference to Previous Notice**: November 20, 2025 (Notice No. 20251120-48)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The share sub-division from Rs.10/- to Rs.2/- will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the price per share proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants must ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN number before the ex-date. Existing shareholders will automatically receive the sub-divided shares in the ratio of 5:1 (5 new shares of Rs.2/- for every 1 old share of Rs.10/-).

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders need to be aware that the ISIN number change is administrative and does not affect their ownership percentage or total investment value, only the number of shares held and price per share.
