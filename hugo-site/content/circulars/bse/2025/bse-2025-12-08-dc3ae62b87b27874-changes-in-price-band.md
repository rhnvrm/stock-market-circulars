## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for 10 securities effective December 9, 2025. The changes include tightening price bands to as low as 2% for four securities (Arunjyoti Bio Ventures, Fynx Capital, Nutricircle, and Vani Commercials), while others receive bands ranging from 5% to 20%. These revisions are surveillance measures to manage volatility and trading activity in these scrips.

## Key Points

- 10 securities affected by price band revisions
- 4 stocks restricted to 2% price band (most restrictive)
- 3 stocks set at 5% price band
- 3 stocks set at 20% price band
- 1 stock (Kesoram Industries) set at 10% price band
- Changes effective from December 9, 2025

## Affected Securities

| Scrip Code | Company Name | New Price Band |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| 530881 | Arunjyoti Bio Ventures Ltd | 2% |
| 537766 | B.C. Power Controls Ltd | 20% |
| 544535 | Bharatrohan Airborne Innovations Ltd | 5% |
| 523732 | Ecoboard Industries Ltd | 20% |
| 507962 | Fynx Capital Ltd | 2% |
| 540696 | KCD Industries India Ltd | 5% |
| 502937 | Kesoram Industries Ltd | 10% |

## Regulatory Changes

Price bands are revised from their existing levels as a surveillance measure. Tighter price bands (2%-5%) indicate heightened monitoring and restrictions on daily price movements to curb excessive volatility or speculative activity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with revised price bands from December 9, 2025
- All trades in affected securities must adhere to new price movement limits
- Members requiring clarifications should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect new price band parameters

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 8, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 9, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities with 2% price bands will experience significantly restricted intraday price movements, limiting both upside and downside volatility. This may reduce liquidity and trading volumes in these scrips.

**Investor Impact**: Tighter price bands protect investors from extreme volatility but may also limit profit opportunities for traders. The 2% band stocks (Arunjyoti, Fynx Capital, Nutricircle, Vani Commercials) face the most restrictive trading environment.

**Market Operations**: Brokers and trading systems must update price band parameters before market opening on December 9, 2025. The wide variation in bands (2% to 20%) suggests different levels of surveillance concern across securities.
