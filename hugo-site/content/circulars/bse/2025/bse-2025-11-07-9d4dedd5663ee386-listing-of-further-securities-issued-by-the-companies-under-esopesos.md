None of the newly listed shares are under lock-in.

## Key Points

- 7 companies issuing further securities under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Total of 10,726,557 new equity shares to be listed
- Trading effective from November 10, 2025
- No shares are under lock-in period
- Urban Company accounts for largest issuance with 10.2 million shares (face value ₹1)
- AXIS Bank issuing 153,657 shares (face value ₹2)
- All companies have provided distinctive number ranges for new shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a routine listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new listings
- Standard trading protocols apply from November 10, 2025
- Companies have complied with listing requirements for ESOP/ESOS securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 7, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date**: November 10, 2025 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Period**: Not applicable (NA) for all securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. ESOP/ESOS listings are routine corporate actions representing small dilutions relative to total outstanding shares. The largest issuance by Urban Company (10.2 million shares at ₹1 face value) and other issuances are typical employee compensation mechanisms.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible short-term impact on liquidity for these stocks. ESOP shares may be subject to gradual selling by employees over time.

**Investor Consideration**: These are dilutive events but factored into existing shareholding patterns. Investors should note the modest increase in share count for valuation purposes.
