## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework is part of BSE's enhanced surveillance mechanism to monitor securities exhibiting unusual price movements or volatility. Securities under this framework may be subject to:

- Reduced leverage limits
- Higher margin requirements
- Trading restrictions
- Enhanced disclosure requirements
- Potential movement to higher surveillance stages based on continued unusual activity

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable margin requirements for securities under ST-ASM
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in listed securities
- Members should inform clients about the surveillance status of these securities
- All trades must comply with framework-specific restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 17, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of 26 securities to the ST-ASM framework indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny on these stocks due to unusual trading patterns or volatility. Investors trading these securities may experience:

- Higher margin requirements leading to reduced leverage
- Potential impact on liquidity
- Increased trading costs
- Enhanced monitoring by exchanges

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new surveillance status and ensure appropriate margin collection. The movement of 7 securities out of the framework (with one moving to ESM) provides some relief but requires system updates.

**Risk Management**: The framework aims to protect market integrity by identifying and monitoring securities with abnormal price movements, helping to prevent market manipulation and protect investors from excessive volatility.
