## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Members and custodians need to plan settlement cycles, fund management, and liquidity arrangements considering these holidays. Back-to-back holidays may require extended pre-funding.

**Market Impact:** Low direct market impact as this is a routine calendar announcement. However, settlement schedules affect fund flow planning and operational readiness for all market participants.

**Planning Considerations:** Several holidays fall on Thursdays and Fridays, potentially creating extended weekends. Multiple holidays in March-April period require careful settlement planning.
