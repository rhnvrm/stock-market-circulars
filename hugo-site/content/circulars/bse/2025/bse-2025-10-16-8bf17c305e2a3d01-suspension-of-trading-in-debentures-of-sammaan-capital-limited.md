## Impact Assessment

**For Debenture Holders:**
- Investors holding these NCDs will receive interest payment and redemption proceeds based on holdings as of record date
- No ability to trade these securities from October 20, 2025 onwards
- Debentures are near maturity (November 3, 2025), minimizing trading impact

**For Trading Members:**
- Must update systems to prevent trading in specified ISINs from October 20, 2025
- Need to communicate suspension to clients holding or interested in these securities

**Market Impact:**
- Limited broader market impact as suspension is specific to one issuer's debt securities
- Standard corporate action procedure for debenture redemption
- Short suspension period (approximately 14 days until maturity)
