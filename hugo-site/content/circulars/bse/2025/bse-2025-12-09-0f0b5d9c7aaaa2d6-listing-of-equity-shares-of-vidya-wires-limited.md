## Impact Assessment

The listing of Vidya Wires Limited adds a new equity security to BSE's platform. The staggered lock-in structure ensures gradual release of promoter and pre-IPO holdings into the market, which helps maintain price stability. Approximately 19% of total shares (4,03,84,316 shares) are freely tradable from listing, representing the public IPO portion. The majority of locked-in shares (over 11 crore shares) will be released within one year, with a smaller portion (4.25 crore shares) locked in for three years. Investors should monitor the lock-in expiry dates as they may impact stock liquidity and price movement when large blocks of shares become tradable.
