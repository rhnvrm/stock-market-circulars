**Non-Trading Days:**
- January 3-4, 10-11, 17-18, 24-26, 31, 2026 (weekends and Republic Day)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Standard settlement calendar that enables members, custodians, and depositories to plan their operations for January 2026. No changes to existing settlement processes.

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is routine scheduling information that maintains market continuity.

**Member Impact:** Members must ensure adequate operational readiness for both T+1 and T+0 settlement cycles, with particular attention to the Republic Day holiday (January 26) which creates a longer settlement gap (January 23 trading settles on January 27).
