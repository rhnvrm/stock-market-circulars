title: Revision of Price Bands - Circuit Filter Changes to 2%
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the circuit filter percentage to 2% for multiple securities across various sectors. This circuit filter restricts the maximum price movement (both upward and downward) to 2% from the previous day's closing price during a trading session. The circular lists scrips with their corresponding scrip codes and ISIN numbers that are now subject to this tighter price band.

## Key Points

- Circuit filter percentage set at 2% for all listed securities
- Restriction applies to both upper and lower price movements
- Affects over 70+ securities across multiple sectors including pharmaceuticals, infrastructure, technology, real estate, and manufacturing
- Securities identified by scrip code, ISIN number, and company name
- Measure likely implemented as surveillance or risk management action

## Regulatory Changes

The exchange has modified the circuit filter mechanism for the specified securities, tightening the allowable price movement band from the standard circuit filters to a restrictive 2% limit. This is typically applied to securities exhibiting unusual price movements, low liquidity, or requiring enhanced surveillance.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure that orders for affected scrips comply with the 2% circuit filter limits
- System-level checks will prevent trades beyond the circuit limits
- Members should update their risk management systems to reflect the revised price bands
- Investors should be informed about the restricted price movement for these securities

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: October 7, 2025
- Effective Date: As specified by the exchange (typically effective immediately or from next trading session)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** The 2% circuit filter significantly restricts intraday price volatility, limiting both gains and losses within a single trading session. This may reduce speculative trading activity and improve price stability but could also impact liquidity.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities will face limited price discovery during the session. Large orders may face execution challenges, and exit/entry strategies may require multiple sessions to execute at desired price levels.

**Market Operations:** The exchange's surveillance mechanism suggests these securities may have exhibited concerning price movements or volatility patterns. The restrictive circuit filter serves as a cooling-off measure to prevent excessive speculation and protect investor interests.

**Sectoral Coverage:** The diverse range of affected companies spans multiple sectors including pharmaceuticals, infrastructure, real estate, technology, and manufacturing, indicating either sector-wide concerns or individual company-specific issues requiring surveillance.
