## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal immediate impact. Lock-in schedules are standard post-IPO formalities that provide transparency about share availability for trading.

**Liquidity Impact**: 5,70,65,577 shares (84.2%) are under various lock-in periods, limiting immediate tradable float to public allotment of 1,06,90,123 shares plus anchor shares post their respective lock-in periods.

**Investor Impact**: Public investors face no restrictions. Anchor investors and promoters must comply with specified lock-in timelines. Staggered unlock dates (January, March, June 2026, and December 2026/2028) will gradually increase available float.

**Compliance Impact**: Routine disclosure requirement with no additional compliance burden beyond standard post-listing obligations.
