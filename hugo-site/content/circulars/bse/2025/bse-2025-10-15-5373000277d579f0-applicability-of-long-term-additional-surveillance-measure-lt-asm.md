title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective October 16, 2025. The circular identifies 7 securities newly shortlisted for LT-ASM, 1 security moving to higher ASM stage, 1 security exiting the framework, and provides a consolidated list of all securities under various ASM stages. Securities under LT-ASM face enhanced surveillance with stricter trading conditions including higher margins and delivery-based trading requirements.

## Key Points

- 7 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Cambridge Technology Enterprises, Ironwood Education, Machhar Industries, Sanathnagar Enterprises, Tata Investment Corporation, Xelpmoc Design and Tech
- Lexoraa Industries moved from LT-ASM to higher Stage II ASM
- Raj Packaging Industries moved out of LT-ASM Framework due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- No securities moved to lower ASM stages or directly to Stage IV
- Changes effective from October 16, 2025
- Consolidated list includes securities across multiple ASM stages starting with Stage I securities like 7Seas Entertainment, A B Infrabuild, A-1 Ltd, Aadi Industries

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements periodic review updates to the Long Term ASM Framework as per BSE's surveillance mechanism. Securities are classified into different parts:

- **Part A**: New entries to LT-ASM Framework
- **Part B**: Securities continuing in LT-ASM but moving to higher stages
- **Part C**: Securities continuing in LT-ASM but moving to lower stages (NIL this period)
- **Part D**: Securities moving directly to Stage IV LT-ASM (NIL this period)
- **Annexure II**: Securities exiting LT-ASM Framework
- **Annexure III**: Consolidated master list of all ASM securities

Special notations indicate T+0 scrips shortlisted based on parent company criteria, and securities classified as per NSE or non-promoter holding.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must apply appropriate margin and surveillance requirements for affected securities
- Securities in LT-ASM Framework subject to 100% delivery-based trading
- Enhanced surveillance margins applicable as per respective ASM stages
- No intraday trading permitted for these securities
- Members must update their systems to reflect new ASM classifications
- Investors should be aware of restricted trading conditions before taking positions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 16, 2025 - All changes to LT-ASM Framework become applicable
- **Circular Date**: October 15, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The inclusion of 7 new securities in LT-ASM Framework will significantly impact their liquidity as trading becomes delivery-based only with no intraday positions allowed. This typically results in reduced trading volumes and wider bid-ask spreads.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under LT-ASM face 100% margin requirements and delivery obligations, making them less attractive for short-term traders. Movement of Lexoraa Industries to Stage II indicates escalating surveillance concerns.

**Investor Impact**: Existing holders of these securities may face difficulty in exiting positions due to reduced liquidity. New investors must commit full capital upfront with mandatory delivery settlement.

**Positive Aspects**: The surveillance framework aims to curb excessive speculation and price manipulation, potentially protecting retail investors from volatile price movements in these securities. Exit of Raj Packaging from LT-ASM to ESM indicates enhanced monitoring measures.
