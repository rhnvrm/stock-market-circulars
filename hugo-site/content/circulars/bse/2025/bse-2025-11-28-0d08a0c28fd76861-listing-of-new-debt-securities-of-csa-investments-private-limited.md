## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it involves privately placed debt securities of a private limited company. The securities carry a CARE B credit rating, indicating higher credit risk and are likely to have limited liquidity. The monthly interest payment structure provides regular income to investors. The total issue size of Rs. 5 crore is relatively small in the context of the overall debt market. This listing is primarily relevant to institutional investors and high net-worth individuals participating in private debt placements.
