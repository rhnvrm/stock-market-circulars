title: Introduction of Trading Member Level Daily Order Message Threshold in Equity
  Cash Segment
---

## Summary

BSE is implementing a daily order message threshold framework for Trading Members (TMs) in the Equity Cash Segment to facilitate balanced and efficient order flow management. Each TM will receive a free threshold of 10 crore order messages per day, with charges of Rs. 0.0025 per message for volumes exceeding this limit. The framework becomes effective January 1, 2026, with a grace period in January 2026 where no charges will be levied.

## Key Points

- Daily free order message threshold: 10 crore messages per TM
- Charge rate: Rs. 0.0025 per message beyond the threshold
- All orders (add, modify, delete) in equity cash segment count towards the threshold, including odd lot orders but excluding settlement auction orders
- First threshold breach each calendar month is exempted from charges
- Daily reporting files to be provided to TMs starting January 1, 2026
- Charges will appear in daily files from January 15, 2026 onwards
- Monthly billing cycle for charge recovery
- Applicable to new and reactivated members during any calendar month

## Regulatory Changes

BSE is introducing a new charging framework for order message flow at the Trading Member level. This represents a shift from unlimited free order messages to a metered approach designed to manage order flow efficiency. The framework establishes clear monitoring mechanisms and cost structures for high-volume order activity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must monitor their daily order message volumes
- TMs should prepare systems to receive and process daily order count files from BSE
- Members need to account for potential charges in their operational budgets from February 2026
- TMs must adapt trading strategies and order management systems to optimize order flow within the threshold limits
- Billing departments should integrate the new charges into monthly reconciliation processes

## Important Dates

- **January 1, 2026**: Framework implementation begins; daily order count files start being provided
- **January 1-31, 2026**: Grace period with no charges levied (monitoring only)
- **January 15, 2026**: Daily files will include charge information for threshold breaches
- **February 2026 onwards**: Actual charges become applicable and will be recovered through monthly billing

## Impact Assessment

**High-Frequency Traders**: Significant impact on members with algorithmic or high-frequency trading strategies that generate large order volumes through modifications and cancellations. These members may need to optimize order-to-trade ratios.

**Cost Impact**: For members exceeding the 10 crore threshold, operational costs will increase. For example, 1 crore excess messages = Rs. 25,000 in additional charges per day.

**Operational Changes**: Trading Members may need to review and optimize their order management systems, trading algorithms, and execution strategies to minimize unnecessary order messages.

**Market Quality**: The framework aims to improve market quality by discouraging excessive order message traffic and promoting more efficient order flow practices.

**Exemption Benefit**: The first breach exemption each month provides a buffer for occasional volume spikes without penalty.
