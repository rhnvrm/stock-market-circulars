These shares were issued to non-promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to conversion of warrants at Rs. 55/- per share (Re. 1/- face value + Rs. 54/- premium).

## Key Points

- 12,00,000 new equity shares of Re. 1/- each listed and permitted for trading
- Shares issued at premium of Rs. 54/- to non-promoters on preferential basis
- Result of warrant conversion with allotment date of June 3, 2025
- Issue price: Rs. 55/- per share
- New shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares
- ISIN: INE08KJ01020

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. Standard listing procedure for new securities following warrant conversion.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members informed of new securities availability for trading
- Lock-in restrictions apply to all 12,00,000 shares until January 31, 2026
- Shares assigned distinctive numbers 163490173 to 164690172

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: June 3, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: July 28, 2025
- **Lock-in Period Ends**: January 31, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing increases MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED's equity base by 12 lakh shares, representing potential dilution for existing shareholders. The 18-month lock-in period until January 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure. The warrant conversion indicates successful fundraising completion and provides additional capital for the company's operations. Market impact expected to be moderate given the preferential allotment nature and lock-in restrictions.
