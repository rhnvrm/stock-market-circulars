## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a company-specific takeover offer affecting only OCTAWARE TECHNOLOGIES LTD shareholders. The offer size of 934,400 shares represents a targeted acquisition and does not impact broader market operations.

**Operational Impact**: Medium for participating members - Trading members and custodians handling OCTAWARE shares need to be aware of the OTB schedule and ensure proper UCC registration for clients wishing to participate. The 14-day offer window provides adequate time for processing.

**Investor Impact**: High for OCTAWARE shareholders - Existing shareholders have the opportunity to tender their shares at Rs. 30 per share during the acquisition window. The offer price represents a 200% premium over the face value of Rs. 10.

**Technical Requirements**: Members must have access to iBBS and RTRMS platforms with valid credentials. Support contacts provided for technical assistance during the offer period.
