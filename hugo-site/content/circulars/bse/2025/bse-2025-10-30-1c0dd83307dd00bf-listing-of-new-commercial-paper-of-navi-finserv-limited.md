## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market impact as it represents a routine short-term debt instrument listing. The Commercial Paper provides Navi Finserv Limited with short-term funding for approximately 6 months at an effective yield. For debt market participants, it offers a rated (IND A1+) short-term investment option in the NBFC sector. The Rs. 20 crore issuance size is relatively small and will not significantly impact overall debt market liquidity. Trading activity will be limited to institutional and high net-worth investors given the Rs. 5 lakh minimum trading lot.
