- Old Face Value: Rs.10/- per share

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The stock split increases liquidity by reducing the per-share price, making shares more accessible to retail investors. The 5:1 split ratio is substantial.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members, depositories, and market infrastructure providers must update systems to reflect the new ISIN. Existing shareholders will see their holdings automatically adjusted to reflect five shares of Re.2/- for every one share of Rs.10/- held.

**Investor Impact**: Positive - Lower price per share post-split typically improves trading volumes and market participation. Existing shareholders' total investment value remains unchanged, only the number of shares increases proportionally.

**Technical Requirements**: Trading and settlement systems must be ready to process the new ISIN from the ex-date to avoid disruptions in trading and settlement activities.
