## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market-wide impact as it pertains to a private limited company's debt instruments. The part redemption affects only holders of the specific debenture series (ACAPL-14.50%-29-3-26-PVT). Trading members dealing with these debentures need to update their systems to reflect the reduced face value. The action provides liquidity to debenture holders through partial redemption while maintaining the instrument's tradability at the new face value. Impact is confined to specific debenture holders and does not affect broader debt market operations.
