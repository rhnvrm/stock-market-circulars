## Summary

BSE notifies trading members that SEBI turnover fees for December 2025 across all segments (Cash, Derivatives, Currency Derivatives, Commodity Derivatives, Interest Rate Derivatives, New Debt, Repo, and EGR) will be debited from settlement/Exchange dues accounts on January 05, 2026. The fees are subject to 18% GST as per regulations effective from July 18, 2022.

## Key Points

- SEBI turnover fees include 18% GST across all segments
- Debit from settlement (valan) account/Exchange dues account on January 05, 2026 (3rd working day of next month)
- Turnover details and fee amounts available in EXTRANET by January 02, 2026
- Invoices available for download in EXTRANET by January 02, 2026
- GST applicable on amount mentioned in column 26 of TF2A file
- Fees debited separately with appropriate narration
- File formats: TF2Ammyy through TF2Jmmyy (where mmyy = month and year)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes in this notice. Continues existing GST framework of 18% on SEBI turnover fees implemented from July 18, 2022 (reference to notice 20251128-1).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure sufficient funds in settlement account (valan account)/Exchange dues account
- Members should download turnover details from EXTRANET > current date > EQ > Transaction by January 02, 2026
- Download invoices from EXTRANET path: Periodic files > 2026 > SEBIDEC2025.Member_Code for December 2025
- Review GST amount payable based on column 26 of TF2A file
- Maintain adequate liquidity for automatic debit on payment date

## Important Dates

- **January 02, 2026**: Turnover details and invoices available in EXTRANET
- **January 05, 2026**: SEBI turnover fees including GST debited from settlement accounts (3rd working day of January)
- **Applicable Period**: December 2025 turnover

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine monthly administrative notice affecting all BSE trading members across segments. Impact is operational rather than strategic - members must ensure adequate funds for statutory payment. Non-compliance could result in debit shortfalls and potential settlement issues. The 18% GST rate remains unchanged from the July 2022 implementation, so no incremental cost impact beyond the turnover-based fee calculation.
