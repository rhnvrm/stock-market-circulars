## Impact Assessment

**Market-Wide Impact:**

This circular affects the entire securities market ecosystem, impacting all regulated entities with investor-facing digital platforms. The clarification provides regulatory relief by extending the compliance timeline while strengthening investor protection through the SCORES integration.

**Operational Impact:**

- **High Impact on Technology Infrastructure**: All REs must audit and potentially upgrade websites, mobile apps, and portals for accessibility compliance
- **Process Changes**: Implementation of periodic audit cycles with certified professionals
- **Complaint Management**: New category of investor grievances requiring specialized remediation processes
- **Resource Allocation**: Entities need to allocate budget and personnel for accessibility improvements and ongoing compliance

**Investor Protection:**

Positive development for investors with disabilities, providing:
