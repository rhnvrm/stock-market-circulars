## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Temporary restriction on SLB liquidity for 33 major stocks including blue-chip companies like Coal India, ONGC, BPCL, Dabur, and Shriram Finance
- Limited impact on cash market trading as restrictions apply only to SLB segment
- Potential increase in borrowing costs for short sellers ahead of shut periods

**Operational Impact:**
- Traders with existing SLB positions must plan exits or extensions around shut periods
- Reduced availability of securities for lending during peak corporate action season
- System updates required by brokers to enforce shut period restrictions

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Short sellers should close positions or arrange alternative borrowing before shut periods
- Long-term lenders may find opportunities to negotiate better rates due to reduced supply
- The concentration of corporate actions in early November may create temporary liquidity constraints in SLB market
