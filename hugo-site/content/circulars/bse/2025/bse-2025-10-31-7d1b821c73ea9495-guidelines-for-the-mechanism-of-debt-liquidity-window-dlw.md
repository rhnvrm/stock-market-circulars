title: Guidelines for the Mechanism of Debt Liquidity Window (DLW)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued comprehensive operational guidelines for the Debt Liquidity Window (DLW) mechanism, following SEBI circular SEBI/HO/DDHS/DDHS-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/141 dated October 16, 2024. The DLW facility allows issuers of debt securities to provide a liquidity mechanism for investors through the stock exchange platform. This is an optional facility available for prospective debt security issuances (public or private placement) on an ISIN basis, requiring Board approval and monitoring by the Stakeholders Relationship Committee.

## Key Points

- Debt Liquidity Window is an optional facility for issuers to provide liquidity to debt security investors
- Applicable only for prospective issuances of debt securities (public issue or private placement basis)
- Must be provided on an ISIN basis at the time of issuance
- Requires prior approval from the issuer's Board of Directors
- Implementation must be monitored by Stakeholders Relationship Committee (SRC) or Board-level committee
- Facility must be objective, transparent, non-discretionary and non-discriminatory
- Trading system includes bid entry module with bulk upload facility
- Settlement process covers both DEMAT securities and funds settlement
- Includes provisions for order placement, modification, cancellation and execution
- Give-up facility available for bid entry
- Contract notes to be generated for all trades

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements SEBI's new framework for introducing liquidity windows in debt securities markets. Key regulatory aspects include:

- Mandatory Board approval requirement for implementing DLW facility
- Oversight mechanism through SRC or Board-level committees
- Framework ensures transparency and non-discriminatory access
- Establishes standardized operational procedures for DLW on BSE platform

- Prescribes transaction charges, STT and other levy structures

## Compliance Requirements

- Generate and provide contract notes to clients

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:**
- Requires BSE members to integrate DLW functionality into their trading systems
- Issuers need to establish governance framework with Board approval and committee monitoring

- Offers transparent, exchange-based mechanism for exiting debt security positions

**Compliance Impact:**
- Adds governance requirements for issuers (Board approval, committee oversight)
- Requires documentation through multiple undertakings and notices
- Members need to ensure proper contract note generation and settlement procedures for DLW trades
