## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium operational impact on debt market participants, particularly trading members and direct investors interested in government securities. The auction provides liquidity injection of Rs. 28,000 crores into the G-sec market through two long-dated securities (2040 and 2065 maturity). The non-competitive bidding facility allows smaller investors and trading members to participate in primary G-sec auctions without price competition, democratizing access to government debt instruments. The staggered bidding deadlines (Direct Investors: Nov 13, Members: Nov 14) ensure proper order processing. Contact details provided for technical support, trading queries, and settlement issues ensure smooth operational execution.
