These securities will be listed and admitted for trading with effect from Friday, October 31, 2025. The total number of shares being listed varies from 3,244 shares (Cyient) to 12,994,998 shares (HDFC Bank), with none of the shares under lock-in restrictions.

## Key Points

- 13 companies issuing further securities under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Total listing effective date: October 31, 2025
- HDFC Bank has the largest issuance with 12,994,998 shares (face value Re. 1)

- No shares are under lock-in restrictions (all marked as NA)
- All shares will be immediately tradable upon listing
- Notice issued by Kinnar Mehta, Assistant Vice President, BSE

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new share counts
- Companies must ensure the new distinctive numbers are accurately recorded
- No additional compliance requirements as shares are not under lock-in

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 30, 2025
- **Listing and Trading Commencement Date:** October 31, 2025 (Friday)
- **Lock-in Period:** None (NA for all companies)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. ESOP/ESOS listings are routine corporate actions that typically have negligible impact on stock prices due to the relatively small number of shares compared to total outstanding shares.

**Liquidity Impact:** Marginal increase in free float for each company. The largest impact is on HDFC Bank with ~13 million shares, but this represents a very small percentage of its total outstanding shares.

**Corporate Impact:** Positive for employee compensation and retention. Demonstrates companies' continued use of equity-based compensation to align employee and shareholder interests.
