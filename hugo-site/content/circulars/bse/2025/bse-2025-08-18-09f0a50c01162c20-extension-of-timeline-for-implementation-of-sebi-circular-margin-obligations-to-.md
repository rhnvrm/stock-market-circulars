## Summary

SEBI has extended the implementation timeline for the circular on 'Margin obligations to be given by way of pledge/Re-pledge in the Depository System' from September 01, 2025 to October 10, 2025. The extension was granted following representations from depositories (CDSL and NSDL) requesting additional time for system developments and end-to-end testing.

## Key Points

- Original implementation date: September 01, 2025
- New implementation date: October 10, 2025
- Extension requested by CDSL and NSDL depositories
- Reason: Additional time needed for system developments and testing
- Circular reference: SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-PoD/P/CIR/2025/118 dated August 18, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced - this circular only extends the timeline for implementing the existing June 03, 2025 SEBI circular on margin obligations through pledge/re-pledge mechanism in the depository system.

## Compliance Requirements

Stock Exchanges, Depositories and Clearing Corporations must:
- Notify their members/participants about the timeline extension
- Disseminate information on their websites
- Implement appropriate systems and procedures for compliance
- Make necessary amendments to Bye-laws, Rules and Regulations

## Important Dates

- **August 18, 2025**: Date of extension circular

## Impact Assessment

The extension provides market participants additional time to ensure system readiness and avoid disruption. This affects all stock exchanges, clearing corporations, depositories, and their members/participants. The delay allows for proper end-to-end testing and system development, potentially preventing operational issues during implementation.
