title: Update Regarding Debt Securities of Aye Finance Ltd
---

## Summary

Aye Finance Ltd has modified financial covenants in its Debenture Trust Deed and Key Information Document. The PAR>90 ratio (Portfolio at Risk greater than 90 days plus write-offs to Gross Loan Portfolio) has been relaxed from the existing 8% threshold to 12% until March 31, 2026, and subsequently to 10% from April 1, 2026 onwards until final settlement.

## Key Points

- Modification applies to Clause 10.3(a)(iv) of Debenture Trust Deed and Section 6.2.2(a)(iv) of Key Information Document
- Existing covenant: PAR>90 ratio not to exceed 8%
- New covenant (Phase 1): PAR>90 ratio not to exceed 12% until March 31, 2026
- New covenant (Phase 2): PAR>90 ratio not to exceed 10% from April 1, 2026 until Final Settlement Date
- PAR>90 ratio = (PAR>90 + write-offs for trailing 12 months) / Gross Loan Portfolio × 100

## Regulatory Changes

Amendment to financial covenants in debt security documentation, providing temporary relief followed by permanent but less stringent covenant levels compared to original terms.

## Compliance Requirements

- Aye Finance Ltd must maintain PAR>90 ratio below 12% until March 31, 2026
- From April 1, 2026, the company must maintain PAR>90 ratio below 10%
- Ratio calculation based on trailing 12-month PAR>90 and write-offs against Gross Loan Portfolio
- Debenture holders and trustees should monitor compliance with modified covenants

## Important Dates

- **Until March 31, 2026**: PAR>90 ratio threshold of 12% applicable
- **From April 1, 2026**: PAR>90 ratio threshold reduced to 10% (permanent)
- **Final Settlement Date**: End date for covenant applicability

## Impact Assessment

The covenant relaxation suggests Aye Finance Ltd may be experiencing higher delinquencies or write-offs than originally anticipated. The 50% increase in the threshold (from 8% to 12%) provides significant operational breathing room but may signal asset quality deterioration. Debenture holders face increased credit risk. The phased approach (12% then 10%) indicates expectation of improved portfolio quality over time, though still above the original 8% threshold. Investors should monitor the company's actual PAR>90 performance and assess whether this reflects temporary stress or structural portfolio quality issues.
