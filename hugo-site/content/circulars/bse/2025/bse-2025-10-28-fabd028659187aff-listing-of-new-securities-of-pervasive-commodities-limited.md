## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium. The listing of 90 crore equity shares represents a substantial increase in the share capital of Pervasive Commodities Limited. However, the immediate market impact is mitigated by the lock-in period extending until May 5, 2026, which prevents these shares from being traded or sold during this period.

**Liquidity Impact:** The lock-in restriction means these shares will not contribute to tradable float until May 2026. Post lock-in expiry, the large volume of shares entering the market could significantly impact liquidity and price.

**Dilution Impact:** Existing shareholders may experience dilution depending on the pre-issuance share capital. The preferential allotment to Non-Promoters changes the shareholding pattern of the company.
