- Each company has designated shut periods during which SLB operations will be restricted

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must observe the specified shut periods for SLB operations
- Trading members should note the ex-dates for dividend entitlement calculations
- SLB positions may be affected during the shut periods for respective securities

## Important Dates

- **Earliest Action**: Vedanta Limited - Ex-date August 26, 2025, Record date August 27, 2025
- **Latest Action**: Swan Energy Ltd. and CEINSYS TECH LIMITED - September 22, 2025

- **Peak Period**: Most actions concentrated in early to mid-September 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects 22 companies across various sectors in the SLB segment. The shut periods will temporarily restrict securities lending and borrowing activities for these stocks.

**Operational Impact**: SLB participants must plan around the shut periods to avoid disruption to their lending/borrowing strategies. The concentration of actions in September may create liquidity constraints in the SLB market for affected securities.

**Investor Impact**: Dividend payments will provide income to shareholders while shut periods ensure proper settlement of corporate actions in the SLB framework.
