## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - These are clarifications to media reports rather than substantive corporate actions or regulatory changes. Piramal Finance's denial of acquisition news and IndiGo's confirmation of regulatory compliance should provide clarity to investors.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal - No operational changes indicated. IndiGo has complied with DGCA requirements by filing its response. Piramal Finance confirms no pending material disclosures.

**Investor Impact:** Low - Clarifications help prevent misinformation from affecting investment decisions. Piramal Finance's categorical denial may stabilize any speculation-driven price movements, while IndiGo's transparency on the DGCA matter demonstrates regulatory compliance.
