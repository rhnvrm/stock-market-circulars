## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. ESOP allotments typically represent small percentages of total share capital and are routine corporate actions. The combined issuance across 13 companies is unlikely to materially affect share prices or trading volumes.

**Dilution Impact:** Individual dilution per company ranges from negligible (0.001-0.01% for most companies) to minimal, depending on their existing share capital.

**Investor Impact:** No direct impact on existing shareholders. These are routine employee compensation instruments that incrementally increase share count.
