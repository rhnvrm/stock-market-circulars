## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing of short-term commercial paper with a very brief 7-day tenure. The instrument is restricted to institutional investors under private placement regulations and does not affect retail markets.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members dealing in debt securities need to be aware of the new scrip code and ISIN for trading purposes. The standard Rs. 5 lakh denomination ensures this remains an institutional product with no retail participation.

**Liquidity Impact**: Given the short 7-day maturity and private placement nature, secondary market trading activity is expected to be minimal. The instrument primarily serves short-term treasury management needs for institutional investors.
