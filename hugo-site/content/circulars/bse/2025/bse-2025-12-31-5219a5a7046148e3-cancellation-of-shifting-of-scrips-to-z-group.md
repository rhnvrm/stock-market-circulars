---

## Summary

BSE has cancelled the shifting of two companies - Brightcom Group Ltd (Scrip Code: 532368) and Naksh Precious Metals Ltd (Scrip Code: 539402) - to the 'Z' group. This cancellation reverses the earlier notice dated December 22, 2025, and the companies will not be moved to 'Z' group with effect from January 02, 2026.

## Key Points

- Cancellation of 'Z' group shift for Brightcom Group Ltd (Scrip Code: 532368)
- Cancellation of 'Z' group shift for Naksh Precious Metals Ltd (Scrip Code: 539402)
- Reversal of Exchange Notice No. 20251222-31 dated December 22, 2025
- All other provisions of the original notice remain unchanged
- Issued by Listing Compliance Department

## Regulatory Changes

This circular reverses a previous regulatory action. The 'Z' group classification, typically applied to companies with compliance concerns or pending corporate actions, will not be applied to these two companies as previously announced.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements are introduced. Market participants should note the cancellation and update their systems accordingly. The companies will continue trading in their current groups.

For queries or clarifications, market participants should contact: bse.soplodr@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **December 22, 2025**: Original notice issued (Notice No. 20251222-31)
- **December 31, 2025**: Cancellation notice issued
- **January 02, 2026**: Previously scheduled effective date for 'Z' group shift (now cancelled)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Positive for the affected companies as 'Z' group classification typically involves trading restrictions and negative perception. The cancellation allows normal trading to continue.

**Investor Impact**: Relief for existing shareholders as 'Z' group stocks face liquidity constraints and additional trading restrictions.

**Operational Impact**: Market participants need to ensure their systems reflect that these scrips will not be shifted to 'Z' group as earlier communicated.
