## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 117 securities across multiple sectors. While the auction is a routine settlement process, the large quantities in certain scrips (particularly VIKAS LIFECARE, Sagility Limited, and Lancer Container) could lead to temporary price volatility in those specific securities.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading members with outstanding delivery obligations must arrange for auction participation or face close-out at auction-determined prices, which may be unfavorable. The wide range of affected securities requires careful tracking by market participants.

**Liquidity Impact:** The auction may temporarily affect liquidity in the affected securities, particularly those with larger quantities under auction. However, for highly liquid large-cap stocks like SBI, TATA MOTORS, and VEDANTA, the impact should be minimal given relatively small auction quantities compared to daily trading volumes.
