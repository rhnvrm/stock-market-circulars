## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The preferential issue involves 97,561 shares, which represents a relatively small addition to the company's equity base. The immediate market impact is further limited by the lock-in period extending until June 30, 2026, preventing these shares from being traded for approximately seven months.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing notification for shares already allotted in August 2025. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and the lock-in restrictions on the specified distinctive number range.

**Investor Impact**: The preferential allotment to non-promoters at Rs. 410/- per share may indicate investor confidence. However, the lock-in period ensures these shares will not add to immediate market supply.
