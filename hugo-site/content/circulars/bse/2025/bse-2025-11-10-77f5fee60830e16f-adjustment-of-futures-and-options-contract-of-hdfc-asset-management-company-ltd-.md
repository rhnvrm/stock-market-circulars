## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must apply the adjustment factor of 2 to all HDFC AMC F&O contracts
- Strike prices must be recalculated by dividing old strike price by 2
- Market lots must be recalculated by multiplying old market lot (150) by 2 to get new market lot (300)
- Client positions must be adjusted by multiplying old positions by 2
- Futures prices must be adjusted by dividing old prices by 2, rounded to nearest tick size
- Trading members should contact designated Relationship Managers for clarifications

## Important Dates

- **November 10, 2025**: Notice date
- **November 25, 2025**: Adjustment implementation date (end of day)
- **November 26, 2025**: Ex-date and record date for bonus issue

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - All existing F&O contracts in HDFC AMC will be adjusted, affecting strike prices, lot sizes, and positions. Traders holding positions need to understand the adjustments to avoid confusion.

**Operational Impact**: High - Doubling of market lot size from 150 to 300 shares increases capital requirement per lot. All strike prices will be halved, creating new effective strike levels. Position quantities will double, requiring system and risk management updates.

**Trading Impact**: The adjustment maintains economic equivalence of positions but traders must account for the new lot size (300 shares) when placing fresh orders post-adjustment. Existing open interest will be automatically adjusted by the exchange.
