## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a routine preferential allotment to promoters following CCD conversion. The shares are subject to lock-in until May 15, 2026, preventing immediate market availability.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new securities and lock-in restrictions. The shares represent approximately 10.8% dilution if the existing base was around 4.5 million shares.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders should note the dilution from preferential allotment. However, since these shares went to promoters, it may strengthen promoter holding. The lock-in period provides stability by preventing immediate sale.
