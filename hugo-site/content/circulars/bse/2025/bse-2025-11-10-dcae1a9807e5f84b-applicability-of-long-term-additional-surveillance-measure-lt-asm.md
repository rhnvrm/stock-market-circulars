title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective November 11, 2025. The circular identifies 8 securities newly shortlisted under LT-ASM, 1 security moving to a higher ASM stage (Stage II), and 1 security exiting the framework due to inclusion in Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM). The LT-ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities with abnormal price movements or unusual trading patterns.

## Key Points

- 8 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Ashnisha Industries, Bothra Metals & Alloys, Calcom Vision, Mishka Exim, Punjab Communications, Reetech International, Rich Universe Network, and Typhoon Financial Services
- Lancor Holdings Ltd (Scrip Code: 509048) moving from current stage to ASM Stage II
- UTL Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 500426) moving out of LT-ASM Framework due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- No securities moving to lower ASM stages
- No securities being directly placed in Stage IV
- Changes effective from November 11, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework continues BSE's surveillance mechanism to protect investor interests by identifying securities with concerning trading patterns. Securities under LT-ASM are subject to enhanced monitoring and may have specific trading restrictions including price bands, trade-for-trade settlement, or additional margin requirements depending on the ASM stage.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ASM-specific requirements for affected securities
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance status when trading these securities
- Securities in higher ASM stages may be subject to additional margin requirements and trading restrictions
- Market participants must adhere to any trade-for-trade settlement requirements if applicable

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 11, 2025 - All LT-ASM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects 10 securities with potential trading restrictions and increased scrutiny. The inclusion of 8 new securities in LT-ASM and movement of Lancor Holdings to Stage II indicates heightened surveillance concerns.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under LT-ASM typically face reduced liquidity due to additional compliance requirements and investor caution. The upgrade of Lancor Holdings to Stage II suggests continuing surveillance concerns requiring stricter monitoring.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should exercise increased caution and be aware of potential trading restrictions, margin requirements, and settlement obligations specific to ASM securities.
