## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine private placement listing of debt securities with limited market-wide relevance.

**Investor Impact**: Low to moderate for debt investors. The CARE B credit rating indicates higher credit risk, reflecting below investment grade quality. The 14.25% interest rate compensates for this elevated risk.

**Trading Impact**: Limited to debt segment participants. The high face value (Rs. 1 lakh) and private placement nature means these securities are likely targeted at institutional or high-net-worth investors rather than retail participants.
