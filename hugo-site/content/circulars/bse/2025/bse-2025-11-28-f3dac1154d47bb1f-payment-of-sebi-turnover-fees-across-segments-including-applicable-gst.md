## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure adequate liquidity in their settlement accounts to cover the monthly SEBI turnover fees plus 18% GST. This is a recurring monthly operational requirement.

**Financial Impact**: The 18% GST adds to the cost of trading operations for all BSE trading members across all segments. Members must budget for this additional cost component.

**Compliance Impact**: Members must monitor their EXTRANET accounts to verify fee calculations and download invoices before the debit date. Insufficient funds may result in compliance issues or operational disruptions.

**Market Impact**: This is a routine administrative notice with no direct market impact. It affects back-office operations and cost structures for trading members but does not affect trading activities or market participants directly.
