title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Lower Revision of Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the downward revision of Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages for 55 securities effective December 9, 2025. These securities have been moved to lower surveillance stages, indicating improved compliance, reduced volatility concerns, or better market behavior. The revisions span across multiple groups including T, X, XT, P, B, Z, and ZP groups.

## Key Points

- 55 securities have been moved to lower GSM stages
- Stage reductions include: Stage 4 to 3 (18 securities), Stage 3 to 2 (15 securities), Stage 2 to 1 (11 securities), and Stage 1 to 0 (11 securities)
- Securities span across various groups: XT (18 securities), X (18 securities), P (5 securities), B (3 securities), T (2 securities), Z (2 securities), and ZP (1 security)
- Downward revision indicates improved market conditions or compliance for these securities
- Notable securities include Gujarat Lease Financing, Rama Petrochemicals, Shree Rajasthan Syntex, and Garware Synthetics

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements reduced surveillance requirements under BSE's Graded Surveillance Measure framework. Securities moving to lower stages will face less stringent monitoring and trading restrictions. The GSM framework is designed to protect investor interests by monitoring securities showing abnormal price movements or poor compliance.

## Compliance Requirements

- Applicable to all market participants trading in the affected 55 securities
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the revised GSM stages
- Securities moving to Stage 0 are effectively removed from GSM surveillance
- Investors should be aware of the revised surveillance status when making trading decisions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 9, 2025 - Revised GSM stages become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact:** The downward revision of GSM stages is favorable for the affected securities as it indicates improved market behavior and reduced surveillance concerns. Securities moving to lower stages may experience:
- Reduced trading restrictions
- Improved market perception
- Potentially better liquidity
- Lower compliance burden

**Market Implications:** This reflects BSE's ongoing monitoring and dynamic adjustment of surveillance measures. The reduction in surveillance stages suggests these companies have demonstrated improved compliance or stabilized market behavior. Investors may view this as a positive signal, though normal investment due diligence remains essential.

|-----------------|---------------------|
| Stage 4 → 3 | 18 |
| Stage 3 → 2 | 15 |
