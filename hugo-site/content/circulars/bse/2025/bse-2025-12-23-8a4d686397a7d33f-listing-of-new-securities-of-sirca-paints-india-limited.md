## Impact Assessment

This is a routine preferential allotment listing with limited market impact. The addition of 19.84 lakh shares increases the equity base of Sirca Paints India Limited.

The preferential issue to non-promoters indicates capital raising activity by the company, possibly for business expansion or working capital requirements.
