## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The listing of over 81 crore new equity shares represents significant equity dilution. However, the 19-month lock-in period until July 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure. The shares being issued to non-promoters at Rs. 60/- (representing the CCPS conversion price) indicates a structured capital raising exercise.

**Operational Impact:** For IDFC First Bank, this conversion strengthens the equity capital base by converting preference shares to equity. For trading members, this adds significant floating stock once the lock-in expires. The pari-passu ranking ensures equal treatment with existing shareholders for dividends and corporate actions.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect on earnings per share. The preferential issue to non-promoters at a predetermined conversion price may differ from current market prices, affecting shareholder value depending on market conditions.
