## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 114 securities but quantities are generally small except for a few scrips. This indicates isolated delivery failures rather than systemic issues.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading and clearing members with positions in these securities need to participate in the auction. Members facing delivery shortages will need to acquire securities through auction, potentially at premium prices.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Shareholders of affected companies may see temporary price volatility during auction. Members who failed to deliver will incur auction costs and penalties.

**Sector Coverage:** The auction spans across multiple sectors including energy (Adani Green, NTPC, Vedanta), pharmaceuticals (Alembic Pharma), technology (Coforge, Moschip), consumer goods (Castrol, Voltas), telecom (Vodafone Idea), and financial services (Jio Financial, IFCI), indicating no sector-specific stress.
