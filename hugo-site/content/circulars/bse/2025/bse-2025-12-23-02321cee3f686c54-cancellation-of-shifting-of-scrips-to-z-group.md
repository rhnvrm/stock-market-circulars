title: Cancellation of shifting of scrips to 'Z' group
---

## Summary

BSE has cancelled the planned shifting of Viji Finance Ltd (scrip code 537820) to the 'Z' group. This reverses the decision announced in Exchange Notice No.20251215-21 dated December 15, 2025. The company will continue trading in its current group and will not be moved to 'Z' group on December 26, 2025.

## Key Points

- Viji Finance Ltd (scrip code 537820) will not be shifted to 'Z' group
- Cancellation is effective from December 26, 2025
- This reverses the earlier notice dated December 15, 2025
- All other provisions of the original notice remain unchanged
- Notice number: 20251223-17

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular cancels a previously announced administrative action regarding scrip group classification.

## Compliance Requirements

Market participants should note that Viji Finance Ltd will continue trading in its current group classification. No action is required from members or investors as this is a reversal of a planned administrative change.

## Important Dates

- **December 23, 2025**: Notice issued
- **December 26, 2025**: Date when the shift to 'Z' group was originally scheduled (now cancelled)

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to one scrip (Viji Finance Ltd). The cancellation of the 'Z' group shift is positive for the company as 'Z' group typically indicates securities with compliance issues or surveillance concerns. The reversal suggests the company may have addressed concerns or the initial classification was reconsidered. Market participants holding or trading this scrip can continue normal operations without the restrictions typically associated with 'Z' group securities.
