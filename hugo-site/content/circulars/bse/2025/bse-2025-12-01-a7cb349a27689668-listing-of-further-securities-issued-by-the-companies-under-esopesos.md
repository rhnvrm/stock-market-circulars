## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities for trading purposes
- Companies have completed listing formalities with BSE
- ISIN codes and scrip codes provided for trading system integration

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 1, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date:** December 2, 2025
- **Lock-in Period:** Not applicable for any of the listed securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The listing represents routine ESOP/ESOS conversions resulting in minor equity dilution across the companies. HDFC Bank has the largest addition at 2.73 million shares, which is negligible compared to its outstanding share base of over 16.5 billion shares.

**Liquidity Impact:** Positive but marginal increase in floating stock for trading. No lock-in restrictions means immediate availability for trading.

**Investor Impact:** No immediate impact on existing shareholders. The share issuance under ESOP/ESOS is a standard corporate practice for employee compensation and has been accounted for in companies' equity structures.
