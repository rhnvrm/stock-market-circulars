The company's status will be changed from "Delisted" to "Suspended" with effect from November 13, 2025. As a result of this status change, provisions of Regulation 24(1) and Regulation 24(2) of the SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 are no longer applicable to the company.

## Key Points

- Noble Polymers Limited (Scrip Code: 539200) delisting has been rescinded by Securities Appellate Tribunal order
- Company status changing from "Delisted" to "Suspended" effective November 13, 2025
- Regulation 24(1) and 24(2) of SEBI Delisting Regulations 2009 no longer applicable
- Notice issued by BSE Listing Compliance on November 11, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Securities Appellate Tribunal's order has resulted in the rescission of the delisting status previously applied to Noble Polymers Limited. This regulatory reversal means that:

- The delisting process initiated under SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 is reversed
- Regulation 24(1) concerning prohibition on trading in delisted securities is no longer applicable
- Regulation 24(2) concerning exit opportunity requirements for delisted companies is no longer applicable

## Compliance Requirements

- Noble Polymers Limited must comply with requirements applicable to suspended securities
- The company is no longer subject to delisting-specific regulatory provisions under Regulation 24 of SEBI Delisting Regulations
- BSE will implement the status change in its systems and trading platform

## Important Dates

- **November 11, 2025**: Notice issued by BSE
- **November 13, 2025**: Effective date for status change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The rescission of delisting represents a significant development for Noble Polymers Limited shareholders. The change from "Delisted" to "Suspended" status provides potential for future trading restoration, though the company remains non-tradable in the immediate term.

**Shareholder Impact**: Shareholders who faced complete loss of liquidity under delisted status now have prospects for eventual trading resumption if the company meets requirements for lifting suspension. This tribunal order provides relief to investors who challenged the delisting.

**Regulatory Impact**: The Securities Appellate Tribunal's intervention demonstrates the appellate mechanism available to companies and shareholders to challenge exchange decisions. The reversal highlights the importance of proper procedure in delisting actions and the availability of judicial remedies.

**Operational Impact**: Noble Polymers Limited will need to work toward meeting requirements for lifting suspension status, which may include compliance with listing obligations, financial disclosures, and corporate governance norms that led to the original suspension or delisting.
