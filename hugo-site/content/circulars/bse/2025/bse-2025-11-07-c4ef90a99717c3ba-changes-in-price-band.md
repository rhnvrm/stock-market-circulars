## Regulatory Changes

Price bands are being revised from their existing levels as a surveillance measure under BSE's trading regulations. The exchange has authority to modify price bands to prevent excessive volatility and ensure orderly trading in securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure all orders placed in these securities comply with the revised price bands from November 10, 2025
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect the new price band limits
- Members should inform their clients about the revised trading restrictions on these securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 7, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The price band revisions will restrict intraday price movements in these 36 securities. Stocks with 1% bands will have severely limited price fluctuation, while those with 20% bands will have more flexibility. This indicates varying levels of surveillance concern across different securities.

**Market Implications**: These measures suggest heightened surveillance on these scrips, potentially due to unusual price movements, low liquidity, or other market integrity concerns. Traders and investors in these securities will face constraints on price discovery and may experience reduced liquidity.

**Investor Considerations**: Investors holding or planning to trade these securities should be aware of the limited price movement allowed within a trading session, which may affect their ability to enter or exit positions at desired price points.
