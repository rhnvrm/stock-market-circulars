## Regulatory Changes

The surveillance framework for securities under IBC continues to operate in stages:

**Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company regarding insolvency proceedings

**Stage 1**: Additional Surveillance Measure for Companies relating to the Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP) as per Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code

**Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance with additional restrictions

Securities can move between stages based on developments in insolvency proceedings. The framework provides investor protection by flagging securities of companies undergoing insolvency resolution.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of securities under IBC surveillance and inform clients about associated risks
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in securities listed under IBC framework
- Market participants should monitor the consolidated list of securities under various IBC stages
- Securities marked with special symbols (~ for T+0 scrips, ^ for recommencement scrips) require additional attention
- Investors must exercise caution when trading securities under IBC surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **December 16, 2025**: Effective date for Ortel Communications Ltd placement in Stage 1
- **December 16, 2025**: Effective date for Goenka Diamond & Jewels Ltd exclusion from ASM
- **December 15, 2025**: Circular issuance date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The surveillance framework directly affects trading in securities of companies under insolvency proceedings, potentially impacting liquidity and investor sentiment for affected scrips.

**Investor Protection**: This measure enhances investor awareness about companies undergoing insolvency proceedings, allowing for informed decision-making.

**Trading Implications**: Securities under IBC surveillance may face additional restrictions, reduced liquidity, and heightened volatility. The exclusion of Goenka Diamond & Jewels Ltd suggests resolution or improvement in its insolvency status.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants must maintain updated systems to track and flag securities under various IBC stages.
