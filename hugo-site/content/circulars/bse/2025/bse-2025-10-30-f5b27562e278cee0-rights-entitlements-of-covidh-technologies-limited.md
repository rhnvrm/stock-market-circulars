## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to shareholders and potential investors of COVIDH TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED. The short two-day trading window for renunciation requires existing shareholders to act quickly if they wish to renounce their rights.

**Operational Impact**: Trading Members handling COVIDH TECHNOLOGIES stock must ensure proper client communication, contract note disclaimers, and dematerialized settlement processes are in place for the brief trading period.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders have a narrow window (2 days) to decide whether to subscribe, renounce, or let their rights lapse. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis requires careful timing of transactions.
