## Impact Assessment

This circular provides a short four-day window for existing shareholders of INDOWIND ENERGY LIMITED to trade their rights entitlements before deciding whether to subscribe to the rights issue. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis ensures clear tracking of RE transactions. Shareholders must act within the specified timeframe as unexercised REs will be extinguished after the issue closing date. The dematerialized-only requirement ensures electronic tracking and reduces settlement risks.
