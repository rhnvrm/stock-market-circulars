## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities experiencing abnormal price movements or trading patterns over short periods (5/15/30 days). Securities under this framework face additional surveillance measures to ensure market integrity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of the updated ST-ASM list
- Securities in ST-ASM framework are subject to enhanced surveillance and may have different trading conditions
- Investors should exercise additional caution when trading securities under ST-ASM

## Important Dates

- **December 15, 2025**: Effective date for all changes to ST-ASM framework

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of securities in ST-ASM framework typically results in:
- Increased scrutiny of price and volume movements
- Potential impact on liquidity as some investors may avoid securities under surveillance
- Enhanced monitoring by exchange to detect and prevent market manipulation
- Securities exiting ST-ASM for other frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM, Trade for Trade) may face different trading restrictions based on their new classification
