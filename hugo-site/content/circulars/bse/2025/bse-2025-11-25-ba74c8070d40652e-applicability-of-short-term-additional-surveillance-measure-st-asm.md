## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
The addition of 4 securities to ST-ASM Stage I indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny due to price movements or trading patterns. These securities will face additional surveillance measures including potential price bands, trade-to-trade settlement, or other restrictions depending on the stage.

**Trading Impact:**
Securities entering ST-ASM may experience reduced liquidity as traders become more cautious. The exit of 6 securities from the framework is positive, indicating improved market behavior and reduced surveillance concerns.

**Investor Impact:**
Investors in newly added securities should expect increased monitoring and potential trading restrictions. The framework is designed to protect investors from excessive volatility and market manipulation. Investors in securities exiting the framework benefit from normalized trading conditions.
