## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers with delivery shortfalls must participate in the demat auction process

- Settlement must be completed as per BSE auction settlement norms
- Penalties and charges as per BSE regulations will apply to defaulting members

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 124 securities with delivery obligations not met, indicating settlement failures across multiple brokers. While this is routine market operation, large quantities in certain scrips (Welcure Drugs, Vodafone Idea, Tata Power) may cause temporary price volatility during auction.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Brokers with shortfalls face additional costs through auction penalties and potentially higher purchase prices. Investors expecting delivery will receive securities through auction mechanism, possibly with delays.

**Financial Impact:** Brokers responsible for shortfalls will bear auction losses (difference between auction price and settlement price) plus penalty charges. Large quantities like 81,866 shares of Welcure Drugs and 51,475 shares of Vodafone Idea represent significant financial exposure for defaulting members.
