## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects trading liquidity and volatility for 22 securities. Tighter price bands (2-5%) will significantly restrict intraday price movements, potentially reducing trading volumes in these scrips.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities will face limited ability to enter/exit positions at desired prices. Scrips with 2% bands will have severely restricted price discovery.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update systems and risk management parameters. Enhanced monitoring required for orders in these securities to prevent rejections.

**Surveillance Context:** The variation in price bands (2% to 20%) suggests differentiated risk profiles, with tighter bands applied to securities exhibiting higher volatility or other surveillance concerns.
