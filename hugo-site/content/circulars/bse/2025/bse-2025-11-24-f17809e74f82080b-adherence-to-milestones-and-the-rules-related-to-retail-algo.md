title: Extension of Timeline for Implementation of Retail Algorithmic Trading Framework
  - Milestones and Glide Path
---

## Summary

SEBI has extended the implementation timeline for the retail algorithmic trading framework (originally due October 1, 2025) to April 1, 2026, while establishing a phased glide path with three mandatory milestones. Stock brokers who are ready may go live from October 1, 2025, while others must meet specific deadlines for registration and testing. Failure to meet milestones will result in brokers being barred from onboarding new retail clients for API-based algo trading from January 5, 2026.

## Key Points

- Original circular on safer participation of retail investors in algorithmic trading was issued on February 4, 2025
- Implementation was previously extended from August 1, 2025 to October 1, 2025
- Exchanges issued detailed operational modalities on July 22, 2025, with clarifications in September 2025
- Stock brokers ready with required systems can go live from October 1, 2025
- Phased glide path established with three mandatory milestones for brokers requiring more time
- Final implementation deadline for all brokers is April 1, 2026
- Non-compliance with milestones results in ban on onboarding new retail API algo clients from January 5, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The circular modifies the implementation timeline of SEBI's February 4, 2025 circular on "Safer participation of retail investors in Algorithmic trading". The framework now includes:

- **Voluntary early adoption**: Brokers ready with systems can implement from October 1, 2025
- **Mandatory milestone-based compliance**: Three specific milestones must be met by all remaining brokers
- **Penalty mechanism**: Failure to meet milestones results in restriction on new client onboarding
- **Universal applicability**: All stock brokers must comply with the full framework by April 1, 2026

## Compliance Requirements

### Milestone 1 (By October 31, 2025)
- Apply for registration with exchange for retail algo product coming through API (in-house and through vendors)
- Register at least one algo strategy with the exchange

### Milestone 2 (By November 30, 2025)
- Complete registration of retail algo products coming through API (in-house and through vendors)
- Complete registration of few algo strategies for retail algo with exchange

### Milestone 3 (By January 3, 2026)
- Participate in at least one mock session with new functionality that is complete in all aspects
- Provide evidence to exchanges regarding participation in mock session
- Exchanges will specify calendar for mock sessions for testing of algos
- Exchange to be notified if broker has not participated by January 3, 2026

### Additional Requirements
- Brokers not ready to go live from October 1, 2025 must provide information on number of existing clients as on September 30, 2025 in exchange-specified format
- Stock exchanges must monitor broker compliance with milestones
- Exchanges must make necessary amendments to Bye-laws, Rules and Regulations

## Important Dates

- **October 1, 2025**: Ready stock brokers can go live with new framework
- **October 31, 2025**: Milestone 1 deadline - Application for registration of retail algo products and at least one strategy
- **November 30, 2025**: Milestone 2 deadline - Complete registration of retail algo products and strategies

- **January 5, 2026**: Brokers failing to meet milestones barred from onboarding new retail clients for API-based algo trading
- **April 1, 2026**: Full algo framework becomes mandatory for all stock brokers
