## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders holding shares as of the record date will be entitled to subscribe to additional shares at Rs.27 per share. This represents a capital raising opportunity for the company and a potential dilution event for non-participating shareholders.

**Trading Impact**: The ex-rights trading status will adjust the market price of existing shares to reflect the value transfer to rights entitlement. Trading members must ensure proper settlement and pricing adjustments from December 4, 2025.

**Market Operations**: The rights issue with a 7:40 ratio indicates moderate capital expansion. The premium of Rs.26 over face value of Re.1 suggests confidence in the pricing relative to market conditions.
