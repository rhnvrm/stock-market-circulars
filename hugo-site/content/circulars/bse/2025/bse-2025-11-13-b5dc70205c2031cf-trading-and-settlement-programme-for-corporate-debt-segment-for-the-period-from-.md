## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal - This is a routine operational circular that maintains existing settlement infrastructure.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Standard monthly schedule publication allows market participants to plan debt segment transactions and manage settlement obligations. The year-end settlements extending into January 2026 require minor adjustments to treasury and settlement operations but follow established practices.

**Participant Action Required**: Informational only - participants should note the schedule and ensure internal systems are aligned with published settlement dates for proper fund and securities management during December 2025.
