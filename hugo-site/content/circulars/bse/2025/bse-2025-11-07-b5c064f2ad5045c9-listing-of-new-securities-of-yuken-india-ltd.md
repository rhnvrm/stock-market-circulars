## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the listing of these new securities for trading purposes
- All 584,000 shares are subject to mandatory lock-in provisions
- Shares cannot be traded or transferred until the lock-in period expires

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date:** July 31, 2025
- **Trading Commencement:** November 10, 2025
- **Lock-in Period Expiry:** May 30, 2027

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a preferential allotment to promoters with a complete lock-in until May 2027, meaning these shares will not be available for trading in the near term. The allotment represents a capital infusion by promoters.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and new distinctive numbers. The shares will be visible in the system but marked as locked-in.

**Shareholder Impact:** The preferential allotment increases promoter shareholding and demonstrates promoter confidence. Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect, though shares rank pari-passu with existing equity.
