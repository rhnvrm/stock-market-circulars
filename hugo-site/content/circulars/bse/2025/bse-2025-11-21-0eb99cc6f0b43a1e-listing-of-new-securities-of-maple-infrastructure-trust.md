## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The listing of 12.06 crore new units represents a substantial increase in the outstanding units of Maple Infrastructure Trust. However, with 88.75% of the new units (10.70 crore) locked until November 2026 and 11.25% (1.36 crore) locked until November 2028, the immediate free float impact will be limited. The preferential issue at Rs. 145.60 per unit provides a reference price point. Trading members and investors should monitor price movements upon listing and consider the future lock-in expiry dates when assessing liquidity and potential dilution effects on the trust's unit price.
