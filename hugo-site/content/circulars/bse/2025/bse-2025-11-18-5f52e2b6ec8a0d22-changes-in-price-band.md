title: Price Band Revisions for 22 Securities Effective November 19, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 22 securities effective November 19, 2025, as part of surveillance measures. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20%, replacing their existing levels. Trading members are required to adhere to these new price band limits for the affected scrips.

## Key Points

- 22 scrips affected with revised price bands effective November 19, 2025
- Price bands revised to: 2% (2 scrips), 5% (10 scrips), 10% (5 scrips), and 20% (5 scrips)
- Most restrictive band of 2% applied to Hindustan Appliances Ltd and Jetmall Spices and Masala Ltd
- Widest band of 20% applied to Game Changers Texfab Ltd, Kama Holdings Ltd, Parshva Enterprises Ltd, Unipro Technologies Ltd, and Vandan Foods Ltd (revised from original - only 4 stocks have 20%)
- Notice issued by Surveillance Department
- Clarifications to be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

Price band percentages have been modified from existing levels to new surveillance-based limits. The changes represent tightening or adjustment of trading bands as part of BSE's surveillance framework to control price volatility in specific securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must enforce revised price bands from November 19, 2025
- All trades in the 22 affected scrips must comply with new price band limits
- Members should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com for clarifications

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 18, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 19, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The revised price bands will limit intraday price movements for the affected securities, potentially reducing volatility and speculative trading. Stocks with tighter bands (2-5%) will experience more restricted price discovery, while those with wider bands (20%) retain more flexibility. The measure primarily impacts retail investors and short-term traders in these specific securities, with minimal broader market impact given the relatively small number of affected stocks.
