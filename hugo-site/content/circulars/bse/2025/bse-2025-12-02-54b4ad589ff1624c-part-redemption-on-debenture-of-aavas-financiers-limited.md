## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a company-specific corporate action affecting only the holders of AAVAS FINANCIERS LIMITED's 7.40% non-convertible debentures maturing in 2030. It does not impact equity markets or other debt instruments.

**Operational Impact:** Medium for debenture holders - Investors holding these debentures as of the record date will receive interest payment and partial principal redemption. Post-redemption, the face value will be reduced to Rs. 90,000 per debenture, which will affect future interest calculations and trading prices.

**Trading Impact:** Trading members need to ensure their systems reflect the reduced face value from December 11, 2025 onwards to ensure accurate pricing and settlement.
