## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The 5-day extension provides existing shareholders with additional time to participate in the rights issue, potentially increasing subscription rates. The relatively large issue size (Rs. 48.08 crores) at par value indicates significant equity dilution for non-participating shareholders.

**Shareholder Impact**: Positive for existing shareholders who need additional time to arrange funds or make subscription decisions. Non-participating shareholders will face dilution given the at-par pricing (Re. 1/-).

**Operational Impact**: The extension shifts all subsequent timelines including allotment (November 24), credit (November 28), and listing (December 3) dates. The simultaneous approval of Q2 results provides current financial performance context for shareholders deciding on rights participation.

**Compliance Impact**: Trading window restrictions on designated persons remain in effect until November 15, maintaining insider trading safeguards during the material announcement period.
