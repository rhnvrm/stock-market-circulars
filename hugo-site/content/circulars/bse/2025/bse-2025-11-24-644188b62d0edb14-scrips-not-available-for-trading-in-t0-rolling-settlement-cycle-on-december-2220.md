title: Scrips Not Available for Trading in T+0 Rolling Settlement Cycle on December
  22 and 26, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that eight scrips will not be available for trading in the T+0 rolling settlement cycle on two specific dates: December 22, 2025 (Monday) and December 26, 2025 (Friday). The affected scrips include major banking, aviation, healthcare, and automotive stocks. These securities will continue to be available for trading in the regular T+1 settlement cycle.

## Key Points

- Four scrips excluded from T+0 trading on December 22, 2025: IndiGo (INDIGO#), Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV#), Max Healthcare (MAXHEALTH#), and IndusInd Bank (INDUSINDBK#)
- Four banking scrips excluded from T+0 trading on December 26, 2025: Canara Bank (CANBK#), AU Small Finance Bank (AUBANK#), Punjab National Bank (PNB#), and Union Bank of India (UNIONBANK#)
- Trading members must note these restrictions for intraday T+0 settlement planning
- Regular T+1 settlement cycle trading remains unaffected for these scrips

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a temporary operational restriction on T+0 settlement availability for specific scrips on specified dates.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure they do not execute T+0 settlement trades in the listed scrips on the specified dates
- Systems and processes should be updated to reflect the unavailability of these scrips for same-day settlement
- Client communications may be necessary to inform intraday traders about the restriction

## Important Dates

- **December 22, 2025 (Monday)**: INDIGO#, TMPV#, MAXHEALTH#, INDUSINDBK# not available for T+0 trading
- **December 26, 2025 (Friday)**: CANBK#, AUBANK#, PNB#, UNIONBANK# not available for T+0 trading

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to intraday traders utilizing T+0 settlement cycle for the affected stocks. The restriction affects high-volume stocks including major PSU banks and private sector leaders, which may reduce intraday liquidity specifically in the T+0 segment on these dates.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to configure their systems to prevent T+0 trades in these scrips on the specified dates. Clients relying on same-day settlement for these securities will need to use the T+1 cycle instead.

**Sectoral Impact**: Banking sector sees four stocks affected on December 26, representing significant PSU and private banking presence. Aviation and automotive sectors also impacted on December 22.
