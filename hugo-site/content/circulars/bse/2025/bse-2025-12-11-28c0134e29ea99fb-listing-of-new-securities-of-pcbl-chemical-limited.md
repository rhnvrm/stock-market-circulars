## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of 1.6 crore new shares increases the total equity base of PCBL Chemical Limited. However, the complete lock-in until June 2027 means no immediate supply pressure on the stock.

**Promoter Holdings**: This preferential allotment strengthens promoter shareholding, as the entire allotment went to promoters pursuant to warrant conversion.

**Shareholder Dilution**: Existing public shareholders face dilution from this preferential issue, though the impact depends on the pre-issue equity capital.

**Liquidity**: No immediate impact on tradeable float due to the comprehensive lock-in on all allotted shares.
