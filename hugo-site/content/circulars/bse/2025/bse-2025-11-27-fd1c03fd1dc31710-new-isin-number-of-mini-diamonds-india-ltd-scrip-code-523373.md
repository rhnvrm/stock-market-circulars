## Summary

BSE has issued a new ISIN number INE281E01028 for Mini Diamonds India Ltd (Scrip Code: 523373) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value Rs.10/- to Re.2/-. This new ISIN will be effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of December 2, 2025. This notice is in continuation to Exchange Notice No. 20251118-57 dated November 18, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN number: INE281E01028
- Company: MINI DIAMONDS INDIA LTD (Scrip Code: 523373)
- Corporate action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Re.2/-
- Face value change: Rs.10/- per share to Re.2/- per share (1:5 split)
- Ex-date for new ISIN: December 2, 2025
- Document reference: DR-768/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard ISIN update following a corporate action (share subdivision) approved by the company.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN number INE281E01028 for trades executed on or after December 2, 2025
- All trading and settlement systems should be configured to handle the new face value of Re.2/- per equity share
- Members should ensure proper adjustment of holdings and positions reflecting the 1:5 subdivision ratio

## Important Dates

- **November 18, 2025**: Original exchange notice date (Notice No. 20251118-57)
- **November 27, 2025**: Current notice date
- **December 2, 2025**: Ex-date - New ISIN number becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

This is a low-impact administrative update affecting only Mini Diamonds India Ltd and its shareholders. The share subdivision increases the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the face value proportionately, with no impact on overall market capitalization. Trading members need to update their systems to accommodate the new ISIN and adjusted share count. No broader market implications expected.
