## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular follows existing BSE framework for Rights Entitlements trading as per notice no. 20200305-21 dated March 05, 2020 and notice no. 20200518-34 dated May 18, 2020.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must inform all clients about commencement of REs trading
- Trading Members must clearly communicate the ISIN of the RE (INE075K20021)
- Contract notes/bills for REs purchases must include a prominent disclaimer stating:
  - Purchase of REs only provides right to participate in the Rights Issue by making application with requisite money OR renounce the REs before issue closes
  - REs that are neither subscribed nor renounced on or before Issue Closing Date shall lapse
- Trading Members must ensure clients do not mistake REs for ordinary shares
- REs must be settled on T+1 basis with trade-for-trade settlement
- Only dematerialized REs are permitted for trading

## Important Dates

- **November 13, 2025**: Notice Date
- **November 17, 2025**: Rights Entitlements trading begins; Rights Issue opens
- **November 20, 2025**: Last day for Rights Entitlements trading (renunciation)
- **November 26, 2025**: Rights Issue closes; last day to subscribe or renounce REs

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to ANNVRRIDHHI VENTURES LIMITED shareholders and traders interested in rights entitlements. The 4-day trading window for renunciation provides liquidity for shareholders who wish to transfer their rights instead of subscribing.

**Operational Impact**: Trading Members need to ensure proper client communication, disclaimer inclusion in contract notes, and adherence to T+1 settlement requirements. The trade-for-trade settlement mechanism requires specific operational attention.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders receive rights that can be either exercised (by subscribing with application money), renounced (by selling in the market during November 17-20), or allowed to lapse. Investors purchasing REs must act before November 26, 2025 to avoid lapsing of entitlements.
