Eight securities are being newly added to the framework, one security will be moved to a higher stage ASM, and nine securities are being removed from the framework.

- 9 securities being removed from ST-ASM Framework
- 6 of the 9 securities moving out are being included in LT-ASM Framework instead
- Framework includes both mainboard and SME securities
- Some securities are aligned with NSE's surveillance measures

## Securities Added to ST-ASM (Stage I)

1. Aravali Securities & Finance Ltd (512344)
2. Comfort Commotrade Ltd (534691)

## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term ASM framework is a surveillance mechanism to monitor securities with abnormal price movements over short durations. Securities under this framework face additional compliance requirements and may have trading restrictions such as:

- Higher margin requirements
- Price bands
- Trade-for-trade settlement
- Reduced market liquidity

Movement between stages (higher/lower) depends on continued price behavior and volatility patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants trading in affected securities must ensure adequate margin availability
- Investors should be aware of the surveillance status before trading
- Brokers must inform clients about securities under ST-ASM framework
- Trading in these securities may be subject to additional surveillance measures including enhanced margins and price bands

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 6, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable
- **Circular Date**: November 4, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of 8 securities to ST-ASM will result in increased trading costs and potentially reduced liquidity for these stocks. Investors may face higher margin requirements and stricter price bands.

**Operational Impact**: The removal of 9 securities provides relief, though 6 are transitioning to Long Term ASM (LT-ASM), indicating persistent concerns. Only 3 securities are being completely freed from additional surveillance.

**Investor Impact**: Traders in affected securities need to adjust strategies accounting for enhanced surveillance measures. The movement of Om Metallogic Ltd to a higher stage indicates escalating concerns requiring closer monitoring.

**Compliance Impact**: Market intermediaries must update their systems and client communications to reflect the new surveillance status of these securities by the effective date.
