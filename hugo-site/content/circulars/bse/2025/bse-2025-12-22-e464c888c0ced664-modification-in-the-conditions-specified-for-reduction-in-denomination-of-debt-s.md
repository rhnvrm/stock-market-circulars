## Summary

SEBI has modified the conditions for reduction in denomination of debt securities and non-convertible redeemable preference shares. The amendment allows issuers to issue zero coupon debt securities at a reduced face value of Rs. Ten Thousand on private placement basis, expanding the earlier requirement that limited this facility only to interest/dividend bearing securities. This change amends Clause 1.3 of Chapter V of the NCS Master Circular dated October 15, 2025.

## Key Points

- Zero coupon debt securities are now eligible for reduced denomination of Rs. Ten Thousand (previously excluded)
- Zero coupon instruments must have fixed maturity without structured obligations
- These securities are typically issued at a discount and redeemed at par, providing compounded returns
- Investors realize returns through the difference between discounted issue price and face value at maturity
- The modification responds to market participant feedback on diversification needs
- Interest/dividend bearing securities continue to be eligible under existing conditions

## Regulatory Changes

Clause 1.3 of Chapter V of the NCS Master Circular dated October 15, 2025 has been partially modified. The amended condition now reads:

**Previous Requirement:** Debt securities or non-convertible redeemable preference shares must be interest/dividend bearing, paying coupon/dividend at regular intervals with fixed maturity without structured obligations.

**Modified Requirement:** Such securities shall be:
- Interest/dividend bearing security paying coupon/dividend at regular intervals with fixed maturity without structured obligations; OR
- Zero coupon debt security with fixed maturity, without any structured obligations

This modification expands eligibility while maintaining requirements for debenture trustee appointment and other conditions specified in the original circular SEBI/HO/DDHS/DDHS-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/94 dated July 03, 2024.
