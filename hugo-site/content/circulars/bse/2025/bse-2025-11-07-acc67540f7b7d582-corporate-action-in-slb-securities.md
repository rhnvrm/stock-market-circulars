## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - affects 25 securities across diverse sectors including IT (Infosys), financial services (JM Financial, Nuvama), pharmaceuticals (Patanjali), auto components (Amara Raja, MRF), and infrastructure (Allcargo, Pipavav Port).

**SLB Operations:** Participants must manage foreclosure of positions across multiple securities over a 12-day period, potentially affecting liquidity in the SLB market for these securities.

**Trading Impact:** The Allcargo Logistics spin-off and Infosys buyback require mandatory foreclosure, which may create temporary supply imbalances in the borrowing/lending market for these high-value securities.

**Operational Impact:** Market participants need to coordinate position unwinding across multiple dates to avoid penalties and ensure compliance with shut period restrictions. The concentration of corporate actions in mid-November (14 securities on Nov 11-14) requires careful portfolio management.
