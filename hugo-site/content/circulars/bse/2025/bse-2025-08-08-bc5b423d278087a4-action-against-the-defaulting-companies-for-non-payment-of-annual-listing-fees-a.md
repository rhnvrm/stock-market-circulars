## Summary

BSE has announced the revocation of trading suspension for three companies that have now paid their outstanding Annual Listing Fees (ALF). Trading in equity shares of ANG Lifesciences India Limited, Vallabh Steels Ltd, and WinPro Industries Limited will resume from August 13, 2025, though these stocks will remain in trade-for-trade mode for other reasons.

## Key Points

- Three companies have cleared their outstanding Annual Listing Fees
- Trading suspension will be revoked effective August 13, 2025
- Stocks will continue in trade-for-trade mode for other compliance reasons
- Action taken under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is enforcement of existing regulations under SEBI LODR 2015, specifically Regulation 14 regarding Annual Listing Fees payment.

## Compliance Requirements

Companies must ensure timely payment of Annual Listing Fees as per Regulation 14 of SEBI LODR 2015 to avoid trading suspension. The three mentioned companies have now complied with this requirement.

## Important Dates

- **August 13, 2025**: Trading suspension revocation effective date
- Previous notices referenced: June 25, 2021 and June 20, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Positive impact for shareholders of the three specific companies as trading will resume. Limited broader market impact as these are individual company compliance matters. The continued trade-for-trade status indicates ongoing compliance issues beyond fee payment.
