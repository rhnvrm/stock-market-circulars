## Regulatory Framework

The Long Term ASM Framework is a surveillance mechanism designed to:
- Monitor securities showing abnormal price movements
- Protect investor interests by imposing additional surveillance on suspect securities
- Apply progressive restrictions through various ASM stages (I, II, III, IV)
- Ensure market integrity and prevent price manipulation

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the securities under LT-ASM and inform their clients
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in these securities
- Additional margin requirements may apply
- Restrictions on derivative positions may be imposed
- Market participants must comply with the specific conditions of each ASM stage

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 23, 2025
- **Circular Date**: December 22, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities under LT-ASM face significant trading restrictions including higher margins, no intraday trading, and 100% delivery-based settlement, which typically reduces liquidity and trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors holding these securities will experience reduced liquidity, wider bid-ask spreads, and difficulty in exiting positions quickly.

**Market Impact**: The inclusion of 7 new securities signals increased surveillance activity and BSE's proactive approach to market integrity. Securities in higher ASM stages face progressively stricter controls.

**Price Impact**: Historical trends show securities entering ASM frameworks often experience volatility and price corrections as speculative interest diminishes.
