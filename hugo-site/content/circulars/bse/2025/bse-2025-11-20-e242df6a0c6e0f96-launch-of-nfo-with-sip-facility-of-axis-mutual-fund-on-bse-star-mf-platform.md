## Important Dates

- **November 21, 2025**: NFO opening date

- **December 11, 2025**: Tentative allotment date; clear funds deadline in ICCL Account by 6:00 PM
- **T+1 day, 9:00 AM**: Deadline for client-initiated funds
- **T+5 or last payout day, 3:00 PM**: Pending transaction deadline (whichever is earlier)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine mutual fund NFO launch affecting only participants in the mutual fund distribution ecosystem.

**Operational Impact**: Low to moderate for BSE StAR MF Platform members and mutual fund distributors. They need to:
- Process NFO applications during the specified period
- Ensure timely fund collection and transfer to ICCL Account
- Manage SIP/XSIP authentication deadlines
- Handle switch transactions appropriately

**Investor Impact**: Provides investment opportunity in a multi-asset fund of funds for interested investors. The extended hours for lumpsum purchases (till 6:00 PM) offers additional convenience.

**Scheme Details**: Six variants cater to different investor preferences (Regular vs. Direct plans, Growth vs. Income Distribution options), providing flexibility in investment approach and cost structure.
