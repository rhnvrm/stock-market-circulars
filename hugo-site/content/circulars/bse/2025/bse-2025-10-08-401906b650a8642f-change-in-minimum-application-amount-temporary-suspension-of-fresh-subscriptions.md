## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts:**
- Lower entry barriers make mutual fund investments more accessible to retail investors with reduced Daily SIP minimums (Rs. 10-30)
- Liquid Fund minimum reduced by 80% (Rs. 500 to Rs. 100), enabling smaller investors to participate
- Encourages systematic investment discipline through affordable daily contributions

**Negative Impacts:**
- Investors seeking exposure to international and global emerging markets face restricted access to three schemes
- Suspension suggests possible capacity constraints or strategic repositioning in international equity offerings
- Existing investors cannot increase exposure through fresh subscriptions or switch-ins

**Market Implications:**
- AMC may be managing fund size or portfolio composition in international schemes
- Trend toward democratization of mutual fund access through lower minimums continues
- Digital and online platforms incentivized through reduced Daily SIP amounts
- Investors seeking international diversification must explore alternative schemes or fund houses
