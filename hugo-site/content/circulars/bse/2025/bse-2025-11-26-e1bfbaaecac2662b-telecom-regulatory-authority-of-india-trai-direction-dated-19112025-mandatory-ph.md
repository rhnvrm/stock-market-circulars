## Summary

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a Direction dated November 19, 2025, under section 13 of the TRAI Act, 1997, mandating phase-wise implementation of 1600-series numbers by entities regulated by RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA for service and transactional voice calls. This directive aims to curb promotional calls disguised as service calls and provide BFSI entities with a distinct identity, enabling consumers to make informed decisions about call acceptance.

## Key Points

- Direction issued under section 13, read with sub-clauses (i) and (v) of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 11 of TRAI Act, 1997
- Department of Telecommunications (DoT) allocated 1600-series on December 23, 2024, for Service and Transactional Voice Calls
- TRAI directed Access Providers to initiate allocation on December 31, 2024
- Despite awareness campaigns, adoption by BFSI entities has remained low
- Most entities continue using ten-digit mobile numbers for service and transactional calls
- Applies to entities regulated by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)
