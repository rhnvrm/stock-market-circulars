## Impact Assessment

This revision primarily impacts members and custodians participating in the acquisition of Bhairav Enterprises Limited shares through the takeover offer. The three-day extension of the settlement date (from the previously announced schedule in Notice No. 20251008-4) provides additional time for obligation processing and settlement completion. Market participants holding or dealing with Bhairav Enterprises Limited shares during the bid period must ensure compliance with the Early Pay-in mechanism and proper use of settlement identifiers. The impact is operationally significant for direct participants but has limited broader market implications as it applies to a single company's takeover process.
