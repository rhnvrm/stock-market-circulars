---

## Summary

BSE has announced the listing and admission for trading of further equity shares issued by 8 companies under their Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOS). The securities will be listed with effect from Tuesday, December 23, 2025. All listed shares have no lock-in restrictions and represent employee compensation allotments.

## Key Points

- 8 companies are listing additional equity shares issued under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Effective listing date: December 23, 2025
- Total of 2,398,774 shares being listed across all companies
- Largest issuance: HDFC Bank Limited with 2,066,610 shares (face value ₹1)
- SBI Life Insurance listing 124,645 shares (face value ₹10)
- CarTrade Tech Limited listing 49,175 shares (face value ₹10)
- No lock-in period applicable for any of the listed securities
- All shares admitted for immediate trading upon listing

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital of the listed companies
- Trading members should ensure proper settlement processes for the newly listed securities
- Companies have completed necessary listing formalities with BSE
- All securities allotted with distinct ISIN and scrip codes for trading identification

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 22, 2025
- **Listing Effective Date**: December 23, 2025 (Tuesday)
- **Trading Commencement**: December 23, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing represents routine employee compensation-related share issuances. The quantities are relatively small compared to the companies' total outstanding shares, particularly for large-cap stocks like HDFC Bank and SBI Life Insurance.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in floating stock for all listed companies. HDFC Bank's 2.07 million shares represent a minuscule percentage of its total equity base.

**Trading Impact**: No expected price volatility as ESOP/ESOS allotments are anticipated corporate actions. Absence of lock-in restrictions means shares are immediately tradeable, though employee holders typically retain long-term positions.

**Operational Impact**: Standard listing procedure requiring system updates for scrip codes and share capital adjustments across trading and depository systems.
