## Compliance Requirements

Investors and unitholders should:

- Update any existing SIP/STP/SWP instructions if they wish to take advantage of new lower minimums or enhanced frequency options
- Consult the updated scheme documents (SIDs, KIMs, SAI) for complete details
- Note scheme-specific exclusions (Liquid Fund, Overnight Fund for SIP; schemes already having these features)

- **Notice Date**: December 19, 2025 (Notice-cum-Addendum No. 33/2025-26)

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts:**
- Increased accessibility: Lower minimum investment amounts (Rs. 500 for ELSS, Rs. 5,000 for Conservative Hybrid and Credit Risk Fund) make schemes more accessible to retail investors

- Better liquidity management: Increased SWP/STP installment frequencies provide more options for systematic withdrawals and transfers
- New investment avenue: SIP facility in Money Market Fund opens systematic investment option in liquid asset class

**Investor Considerations:**
- Existing investors with automated transactions should verify if changes affect their current instructions
- Lower barriers to entry may attract new retail investors to mutual fund investment
- Enhanced frequency options beneficial for investors seeking regular income or portfolio rebalancing strategies
