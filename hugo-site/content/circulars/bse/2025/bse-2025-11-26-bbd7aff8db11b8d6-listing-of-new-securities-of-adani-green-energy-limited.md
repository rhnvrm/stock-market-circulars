## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The listing adds approximately 2.46 crore shares to the company's equity base, issued at a significant premium, indicating strong promoter confidence. However, all shares are under lock-in until May 2027, preventing immediate supply increase.

**Operational Impact**: The preferential allotment represents substantial capital infusion (approximately Rs. 3,641 crores at the issue price) that will strengthen the company's financial position for renewable energy projects.

**Investor Considerations**: 
- Promoter holding increases through this allotment
- Shares issued at Rs. 1480.75 reflects a substantial premium to face value
- Complete lock-in until 2027 prevents any immediate selling pressure
- Dilution impact on existing non-promoter shareholders
