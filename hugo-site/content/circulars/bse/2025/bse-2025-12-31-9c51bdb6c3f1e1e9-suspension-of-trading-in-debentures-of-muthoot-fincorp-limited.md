## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealings in the specified debentures from January 6, 2026
- Members must ensure no trades are executed in MFL-8.75%-29-1-26-NCD (Code: 937407) and MFL-ZC-29-1-26-NCD (Code: 937417) on or after the suspension date

- **January 6, 2026**: Trading suspension effective date (no dealings from this date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders and potential traders of these two specific debenture series. The suspension is procedural and linked to scheduled redemption.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will receive redemption proceeds as per terms. No trading opportunity available from January 6, 2026 onwards.

**Liquidity Impact**: Trading liquidity in these instruments will cease from the suspension date, but this is expected given the imminent redemption event.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trades in these securities (ISIN: INE549K07949 and INE549K07972) from January 6, 2026.
