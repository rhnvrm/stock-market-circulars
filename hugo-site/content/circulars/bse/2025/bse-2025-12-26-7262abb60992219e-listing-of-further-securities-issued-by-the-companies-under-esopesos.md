## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. These are routine ESOP/ESOS conversions representing employee compensation schemes. The securities have no lock-in restrictions and represent a small percentage of total outstanding shares for most companies. The largest absolute issuance is ICICI Bank with 480,952 shares, which is negligible compared to its total share base of over 7.15 billion shares. This is standard corporate action related to employee incentive programs.
