## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market impact as it represents a routine short-term funding instrument for Time Technoplast Limited through the commercial paper route. The high credit ratings (A1+ from both CRISIL and ICRA) indicate strong creditworthiness. The issuance provides the company with short-term working capital financing at competitive rates. For debt market participants, this adds another instrument in the commercial paper segment with approximately 3-month maturity. The private placement nature limits the trading universe to qualified institutional buyers and sophisticated investors.
