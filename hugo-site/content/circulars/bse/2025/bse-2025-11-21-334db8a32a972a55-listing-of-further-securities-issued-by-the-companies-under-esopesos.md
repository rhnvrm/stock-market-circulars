## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The number of shares being listed represents routine ESOP/ESOS exercises and is relatively small compared to the total outstanding shares of these large-cap and mid-cap companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in float for all companies. The largest addition is 164,286 shares for Axis Bank, which represents a fraction of its total outstanding shares.

**Investor Impact**: No immediate impact on existing shareholders. These are routine corporate actions related to employee compensation schemes.

**Trading Impact**: No lock-in restrictions mean these shares are immediately available for trading, but given the small quantities, no significant volatility is expected.
