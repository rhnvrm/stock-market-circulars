## Impact Assessment

This part redemption affects holders of four series of non-convertible debentures of Kolte-Patil Developers Ltd. The redemption reduces the outstanding face value of each series, returning capital to debenture holders while keeping the debentures active with lower face values. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face values to ensure accurate trading and settlement. The impact is limited to the debt segment and specific debenture holders of this issuer.
