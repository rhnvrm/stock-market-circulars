  - REs must be subscribed with requisite application money or renounced before issue closing date
  - Unsubscribed/unrenounced REs will lapse and be extinguished after issue closing date

## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium impact limited to Hindustan Construction Company Limited shareholders and market participants interested in rights offerings. Existing shareholders can trade their rights entitlements during the 6-day window (Dec 12-17) or participate in the rights issue during the full 11-day period (Dec 12-22). The trade-for-trade settlement ensures transparency but may limit liquidity. Investors must act before December 22 to avoid losing their rights entitlements. Trading members need to ensure proper client communication and disclaimer protocols to comply with disclosure requirements.
