## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 136.12 million shares represents significant equity dilution. The lock-in period until June 5, 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure from these shares.

**Shareholder Impact**: The preferential allotment to Non-Promoters dilutes existing shareholders' holdings. However, shares ranking pari-passu ensures equal rights for all shareholders.

**Liquidity Impact**: Trading liquidity may improve post lock-in expiry, though immediate impact is limited due to trading restrictions on the newly issued shares.
