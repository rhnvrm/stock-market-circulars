**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing of privately placed debt securities with no put/call options. The securities are issued by a non-banking finance company with a moderate credit rating (BBB-/Stable).

**Operational Impact**: Trading members can now trade these debentures on the BSE Debt segment. The relatively small issue size (500 debentures) and private placement nature suggest limited liquidity and trading activity.

**Investor Impact**: These securities offer a high coupon rate of 14.4% with monthly interest payments, suitable for investors seeking regular income with moderate credit risk tolerance.
