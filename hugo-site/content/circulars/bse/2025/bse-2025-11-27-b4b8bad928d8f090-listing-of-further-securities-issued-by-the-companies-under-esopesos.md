The shares have no lock-in period and range from small allocations to significant quantities, with IDFC First Bank issuing the largest number at 3,949,026 shares.

## Key Points

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to update their systems for the newly listed securities
- The new shares will be available for trading from November 28, 2025
- Each company has been assigned distinct ISIN codes and distribution number ranges for the new shares

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** November 27, 2025
- **Listing and Trading Effective Date:** November 28, 2025
- **Lock-in Period:** Not Applicable (NA) for all companies

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - These are routine ESOP/ESOS share listings that occur regularly as part of employee compensation schemes. The quantities being listed represent small percentages of the total outstanding shares for most companies.

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal - The shares are immediately tradeable with no lock-in restrictions, but given the relatively small quantities compared to typical trading volumes, impact on stock liquidity should be negligible.

**Investor Impact:** Neutral - Existing shareholders may experience minor dilution, but this is expected and disclosed as part of standard ESOP/ESOS practices. The lack of lock-in indicates these shares can be sold immediately by option holders.

**Company-Specific Notes:**
- IDFC First Bank's issuance of nearly 4 million shares is the most significant in absolute numbers
- Go Digit General Insurance and Aditya Infotech also have substantial issuances
- All other companies have relatively modest share issuances under 100,000 shares
