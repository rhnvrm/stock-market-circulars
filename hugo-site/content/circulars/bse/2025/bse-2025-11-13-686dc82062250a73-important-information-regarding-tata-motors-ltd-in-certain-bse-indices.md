## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The exclusion of Tata Motors from BSE SENSEX, India's flagship index and barometer of economic growth, represents a significant market event. As a major automobile sector company, its removal will materially impact index composition and sector representation.

**Index Impact**: 28 indices affected including premier benchmarks like SENSEX, BSE 100, BSE 200, BSE 500, and sector-specific BSE AUTO index. This widespread impact affects multiple market cap categories (large cap, mid cap) and thematic indices.

**Fund Impact**: All passive investment products (ETFs, index funds) tracking these 28 indices must execute forced selling of Tata Motors shares, potentially creating selling pressure. Active rebalancing required across domestic and international funds benchmarked to these indices.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in index-tracking products will see automatic portfolio changes. The exclusion follows a transparent, pre-announced process related to the demerger corporate action, providing predictability to market participants.
