## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The surveillance measure affects 9 securities, signaling to investors that these companies have made announcements or disclosures related to insolvency proceedings. This represents the initial stage of IBC surveillance.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these securities should be aware of the elevated risk profile associated with companies under insolvency proceedings. Stage 0 indicates receipt of corporate announcements regarding insolvency, which may progress to higher surveillance stages.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under IBC surveillance may experience increased volatility and reduced liquidity. Market participants should factor in the insolvency status when making trading decisions.

**Operational Impact**: Limited immediate operational impact on exchanges or trading systems. The surveillance framework continues to operate as designed to protect market integrity and provide transparency regarding companies under insolvency resolution.
