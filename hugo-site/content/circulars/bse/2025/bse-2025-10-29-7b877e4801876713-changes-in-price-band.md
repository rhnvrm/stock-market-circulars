title: Price Band Revisions for 24 Securities Effective October 30, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 24 securities with effect from October 30, 2025. The changes include varying band percentages ranging from 2% to 20%, affecting securities across different sectors. Trading members have been notified to adjust their trading systems accordingly.

## Key Points

- 24 scrips will have revised price bands effective October 30, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% to 20% depending on the security
- Most securities (8 out of 24) have been assigned a 5% price band
- Six securities have been assigned the tightest 2% price band
- Two securities (DELPHI WORLD MONEY LIMITED and MANGALAM INDUSTRIAL FINANCE LIMITED) have the widest 20% price band
- Changes apply to equity segment trading

## Regulatory Changes

The revised price bands represent surveillance measures to control price volatility in the specified securities. The bands limit the maximum price movement (up or down) that a security can experience in a single trading day.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new price bands before market opening on October 30, 2025
- All trades in the affected scrips must adhere to the revised price band limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 29, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will affect intraday trading volatility for the 24 specified securities. Tighter bands (2%) will restrict price movements for higher-risk securities like Hamps Bio Ltd and Jainco Projects India Ltd, while broader bands (20%) for Delphi World Money Limited and Mangalam Industrial Finance Limited allow for greater price discovery. This surveillance measure aims to prevent excessive speculation and protect investors from abnormal price movements.
