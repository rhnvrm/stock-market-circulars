## Summary

BSE has announced updates to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective December 31, 2025.

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities with abnormal price movements and increased volatility. Securities under this framework face additional surveillance measures including:

- Enhanced monitoring of price and volume movements
- Potential additional margin requirements
- Increased scrutiny of trading patterns
- Investor awareness alerts

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable margin requirements for securities in ST-ASM
- Investors should be aware of the additional surveillance status when trading these securities
- Market participants must comply with any additional disclosure or reporting requirements
- Brokers should inform clients about the surveillance status of these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 31, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of securities in ST-ASM framework typically results in:

- **Trading Impact**: Potential reduction in liquidity due to higher margins and surveillance measures
- **Investor Awareness**: Heightened caution among investors regarding these securities
- **Price Discovery**: Enhanced monitoring may lead to more stable price discovery
- **Risk Management**: Better risk mitigation for unusual price volatility

Securities moving out of ST-ASM may experience improved liquidity, though those transitioning to other frameworks (LT-ASM, GSM, ESM) will continue to face surveillance measures. The single security moving to LT-ASM (K&R Rail Engineering) will be subject to longer-term surveillance protocols.
