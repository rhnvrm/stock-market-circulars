## Summary

Godrej Properties Ltd (GPL) has proposed amendments to the Debenture Trust Deed dated 04th July 2023 for Non-Convertible Debentures worth INR 1,500 Crores. The amendments involve deletion of five broad covenants that statutory auditors are unable to certify due to their open-ended nature. These covenants will be incorporated into management representation instead, with Debenture Trustee approval obtained.

## Key Points

- Total NCD issuance: INR 1,500 Crores under Trust Deed dated 04th July 2023
- Two ISINs affected: INE484J08048 and INE484J08030
- Five covenant clauses (2.3(i), 2.3(iii), 2.3(viii), 2.3(xv)(b), 2.3(xxiv)(c)) being deleted from Trust Deed
- Deleted covenants will be incorporated into management representation
- Debenture Trustee has approved all proposed changes
- Reason for changes: Statutory auditors unable to provide certification on broad and open-ended covenants

## Regulatory Changes

### Deleted Covenants from Trust Deed:

**Clause 2.3(i)**: Obtaining, complying with, and maintaining authorizations necessary for business operations and Transaction Document obligations

**Clause 2.3(iii)**: Compliance with all provisions of Disclosure Documents and Transaction Documents until Redemption Date

**Clause 2.3(viii)**: Payment and discharge of all taxes, rates, rents, and governmental charges before penalties attach, and making all required filings under Applicable Laws

**Clause 2.3(xv)(b)**: Obtaining and maintaining authorizations required to lawfully comply with Transaction Documents

**Clause 2.3(xxiv)(c)**: Supplying details of litigation, arbitration, or administrative proceedings that could restrain obligations or have Material Adverse Effect

## Compliance Requirements

- Godrej Properties Ltd to incorporate deleted covenants into management representation letters
- Supplementary Debenture Trust Deed to be executed documenting these changes
- Management representation to cover authorizations, compliance, tax payments, filings, and litigation disclosure
- Changes require formal documentation through supplementary deed

## Important Dates

- Original Trust Deed Date: 04th July 2023
- Circular Date: 10th November 2025
- No specific implementation deadline mentioned in the circular

## Impact Assessment

**Debenture Holders**: Minimal direct impact as covenants remain enforceable through management representation and Debenture Trustee has approved changes. Shifts monitoring mechanism from statutory auditor certification to management attestation.

**Godrej Properties Ltd**: Reduces auditor certification burden while maintaining covenant obligations through management representation. Streamlines compliance processes for broad operational covenants.

**Statutory Auditors**: Removes requirement to certify open-ended covenants that lack specific measurable criteria.

**Market Impact**: Limited market impact as this is a procedural amendment with Debenture Trustee approval, maintaining substantive protections through alternative mechanism.
