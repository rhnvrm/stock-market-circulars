---

## Summary

InterGlobe Aviation Limited (IndiGo) issued a clarification on December 12, 2025, responding to stock exchange queries about a news article claiming SEBI was examining whether the company failed in disclosures and scrutinizing the board's role. The company confirms it has not received any communication from SEBI indicating commencement of any assessment or examination, making the news article factually incorrect. The company has been responding to routine queries from NSE and BSE regarding ongoing LODR compliance obligations.

## Key Points

- Company confirms no communication received from SEBI regarding any examination or assessment
- Information in the news article (Moneycontrol, December 11, 2025) is factually incorrect

- All stock exchange queries have been responded to in a timely manner
- Company is not aware of any undisclosed information that could explain price movement
- Company cannot determine the impact of the news item on stock price
- Clarification issued pursuant to Regulation 30(10) of LODR Regulations

## Regulatory Context

The clarification was issued in response to:
- NSE letter dated December 11, 2025 (Reference: NSE/CM/Surveillance/16161)
- BSE letter dated December 11, 2025 (Reference: L/SURV/ONL/RV/APJ/(2025-2026)/104)
- News article published on Moneycontrol on December 11, 2025

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

The clarification addresses market speculation arising from media reports about potential SEBI action. By confirming no formal regulatory examination has been initiated, the company aims to provide transparency to investors regarding its regulatory status. The company's acknowledgment that it cannot determine the impact of the news item on stock price suggests there may have been market volatility following the news publication. The clarification is significant for investor confidence but does not indicate any material regulatory concerns at this time.
