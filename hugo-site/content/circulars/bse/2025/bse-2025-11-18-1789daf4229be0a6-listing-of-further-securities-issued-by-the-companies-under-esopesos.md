## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard administrative listing process for shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities for trading purposes
- Standard listing compliance requirements apply
- Companies have completed necessary allotment and ISIN assignment procedures

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** November 18, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date:** November 19, 2025 (Wednesday)
- **Lock-in Period:** Not applicable (NA) for all shares

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The shares represent employee compensation and the quantities are relatively small compared to the outstanding equity of these companies. The largest single issuance is 205,965 shares by Paytm.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible impact on overall market liquidity. ESOP shares typically have limited immediate trading activity as they are issued to employees.

**Shareholder Impact:** Minor dilution effect on existing shareholders, consistent with approved ESOP schemes. The absence of lock-in periods means these shares can be traded immediately, though employee recipients may choose to hold.
