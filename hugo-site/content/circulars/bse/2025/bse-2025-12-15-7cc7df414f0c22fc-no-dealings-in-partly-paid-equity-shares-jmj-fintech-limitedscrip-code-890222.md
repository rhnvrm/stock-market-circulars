  890222)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a notice prohibiting dealings in partly paid equity shares of JMJ Fintech Limited (Scrip Code 890222) effective December 19, 2025. The company has fixed a record date to identify shareholders eligible to receive call notices for payment of first and final call money of Rs. 7.35 per share on rights equity shares.

## Key Points

- Trading in partly paid equity shares of JMJ Fintech Limited is prohibited from December 19, 2025
- Record date fixed: December 19, 2025
- Settlement number: DR-781/2025-2026
- First and final call amount: Rs. 7.35 per share (Rs. 7/- towards face value, Rs. 0.35 towards securities premium)
- Purpose: To ascertain shareholders of partly paid-up equity shares eligible to pay the call money
- Trading members must not execute any transactions in these partly paid shares

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This is a standard corporate action procedure for rights issues where call money is being collected on partly paid shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must immediately cease all dealings in partly paid equity shares of JMJ Fintech Limited (Scrip Code 890222)
- Trading members must inform their clients holding partly paid shares about the trading restriction
- Shareholders of partly paid shares will receive call notices for payment of Rs. 7.35 per share

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 15, 2025
- **Record Date**: December 19, 2025
- **No Dealings From**: December 19, 2025
- **Settlement Number**: DR-781/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Complete suspension of trading in partly paid shares prevents any liquidity or exit opportunity for current holders until call money is paid and shares become fully paid.

**Shareholder Impact**: Critical - Shareholders must respond to call notices and pay Rs. 7.35 per share to convert partly paid shares to fully paid shares. Failure to pay call money may result in forfeiture of shares and loss of investment.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block transactions in scrip code 890222 (partly paid) and communicate the restriction to affected clients immediately.
