## Regulatory Changes

- Trading members must update the paid-up value to Rs. 1,00,000 per debenture in their records
- All systems and processes involving these debt securities must be modified before the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 29, 2025
- **Effective Date:** Thursday, October 30, 2025 - New ISIN and paid-up value becomes applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Debenture Holders:** Debenture holders who have provided call money will see their holdings reflected under the new ISIN with increased paid-up value per debenture.

**Impact on Trading Members:** Trading members need to ensure their systems are updated to handle the new ISIN and paid-up value for proper trade processing and settlement.

**Market Impact:** This is an administrative change affecting specific debt securities. The consolidation of paid-up value (from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 1,00,000 per debenture) suggests a call option exercise or consolidation event that reduces the number of outstanding units while increasing the face value per unit.
