title: Non-Business Day for certain schemes of Mutual Fund on BSE StAR MF Platform
  - UPDATE
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update notification regarding non-business days for certain mutual fund schemes on the BSE StAR MF Platform in November 2025. The circular specifies that select schemes from Bandhan Mutual Fund and Invesco Mutual Fund will not be available for transactions on specific dates due to holidays in underlying international markets.

## Key Points

- Bandhan US Treasury Bond 0-1 year Fund of Fund will observe a non-business day on November 11, 2025
- Four Invesco fund of funds schemes will observe non-business days on November 11, 2025
- The same four Invesco schemes will also observe a non-business day on November 27, 2025
- Affected Invesco schemes include: Invesco Pan European Equity FoF, Invesco Global Equity Income FoF, Invesco Global Consumer Trends FoF, and Invesco EQQQ Nasdaq-100 ETF FoF
- These non-business days are likely due to closure of underlying international markets

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced in this circular. This is a routine operational notification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and participants should note that transactions in the specified mutual fund schemes will not be processed on the mentioned non-business days
- Investors should plan their transactions accordingly and avoid placing orders for these schemes on the specified dates
- BSE StAR MF Platform participants should update their systems to reflect these non-business days

## Important Dates

- **November 11, 2025**: Non-business day for Bandhan US Treasury Bond 0-1 year FoF and all four Invesco schemes
- **November 27, 2025**: Non-business day for all four Invesco schemes

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this circular is minimal and limited to investors and distributors dealing with the specific fund of funds schemes mentioned. Since these are international fund of funds that invest in overseas markets, the non-business days align with holidays in those respective markets (likely Veterans Day on November 11 and Thanksgiving Day on November 27 in the US). Regular domestic mutual fund operations and other schemes on the BSE StAR MF Platform will continue normally. Investors in these specific schemes should plan their transactions on alternative dates.
