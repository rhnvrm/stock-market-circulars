## Summary

BSE has issued a notice regarding the assignment of a new ISIN number for A B Infrabuild Limited (Scrip Code: 544281) following the sub-division of equity shares. The new ISIN INE00YB01025 replaces the old ISIN as shares are subdivided from face value of Rs.10/- to Re.1/- per share. This change will be effective for all trades executed on or after October 17, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: A B INFRABUILD LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544281)
- New ISIN Number: INE00YB01025
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Re.1/-
- Ex-Date: October 17, 2025
- Document Reference: DR-738/2025-2026
- This is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251007-57 dated October 07, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action where the company has subdivided its equity shares, necessitating the issuance of a new ISIN to distinguish the new face value shares from the old ones.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN INE00YB01025 for all trades in A B Infrabuild Limited executed on or after October 17, 2025
- Market participants should update their systems and records to reflect the new ISIN and revised face value
- Demat accounts will need to reflect the subdivided shares with the new ISIN post the record date

## Important Dates

- **October 15, 2025**: Notice issued by BSE
- **October 17, 2025**: Ex-Date - New ISIN becomes effective for trading

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The stock sub-division increases the number of shares outstanding by 10 times while reducing the share price proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors.

**Operational Impact:** Shareholders will see their holding quantity increase by 10 times with a corresponding reduction in per-share price. All existing shareholders as of the record date will automatically receive the subdivided shares in their demat accounts with the new ISIN. Trading and settlement systems must be updated to use the new ISIN from the ex-date.
