## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Auditors:** Medium - Empanelled system auditors must follow the new technical procedure for SAR submission through Cymmetri authentication system. The process requires specific browser and software configurations.

**Impact on Stockbrokers/Trading Members:** Low - Members are required to enter preliminary information that auditors will verify, but the primary compliance burden is on the auditors.

**Operational Impact:** This is a routine regulatory compliance exercise conducted semi-annually. The circular provides technical guidance to ensure smooth submission process and does not introduce new audit requirements or change existing compliance obligations.
