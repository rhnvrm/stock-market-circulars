---

## Summary

BSE has announced revisions to price bands for five securities effective from November 28, 2025. The changes include varying band percentages ranging from 2% to 10% for different scrips under surveillance monitoring.

## Key Points

- Five scrips will have revised price bands effective November 28, 2025
- Mangalam Drugs & Organics Ltd (532637) - price band revised to 5%
- Mangalam Industrial Finance Ltd (537800) - price band revised to 5%
- Omnitex Industries India Ltd (514324) - price band revised to 2%
- Prabhhans Industries Ltd (530361) - price band revised to 5%
- Shining Tools Ltd (544607) - price band revised to 10%
- All trading members have been notified of these changes

## Regulatory Changes

Price band restrictions have been modified from their previous levels. The new bands represent tighter or modified controls on daily price movements for these securities, likely due to surveillance measures or volatility concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement the revised price bands in their trading systems before market opening on November 28, 2025
- Queries regarding the price band changes should be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Members must ensure compliance with the new trading limits for the affected scrips

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** November 27, 2025
- **Effective Date:** November 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will limit the maximum daily price movement for these securities. Omnitex Industries faces the tightest restriction at 2%, while Shining Tools has the widest band at 10%. These changes may reduce volatility but could also impact liquidity in these scrips. The surveillance department's involvement suggests these measures are aimed at market stability and investor protection.
