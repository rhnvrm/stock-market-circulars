## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The transition from MT Group to M Group will enhance liquidity and trading flexibility for GLOBAL OCEAN LOGISTICS INDIA LIMITED shares. The move from Trade for Trade (T2T) to Rolling settlement indicates the stock has completed its initial surveillance period post-SME IPO listing.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members will need to adjust their risk management and settlement processes. Rolling settlement allows for T+1 or T+2 settlement cycles instead of the more restrictive Trade for Trade basis, which typically requires full upfront payment and delivery. This change should increase trading volumes and investor participation in the stock.
