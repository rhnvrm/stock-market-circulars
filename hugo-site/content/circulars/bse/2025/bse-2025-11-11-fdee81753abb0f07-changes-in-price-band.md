## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 10 securities effective November 12, 2025. The price bands range from 2% to 10%, representing tightened trading restrictions for these stocks. These surveillance measures limit the maximum price movement allowed in a single trading session for the affected securities.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This circular implements existing surveillance measures by adjusting price band percentages for specific securities based on BSE's surveillance criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure trades in affected securities remain within revised price bands
- Order management systems should be updated to reflect new price limits
- No action required from listed companies; this is a market surveillance measure

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 11, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 12, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to specific securities. Tighter price bands reduce intraday volatility and may reduce liquidity for affected stocks. Securities with 2% bands face the most restrictive trading environment.

**Trading Impact**: Investors and traders in these 10 securities will experience limited daily price movement, reducing potential for both gains and losses within a single session. This may lead to multi-day trends instead of single-day sharp movements.

**Investor Consideration**: The price band tightening typically indicates heightened surveillance due to unusual price movements, volatility concerns, or other market integrity issues. Investors should exercise caution when trading these securities.
