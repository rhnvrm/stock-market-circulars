## Key Points

- High-value stocks have larger intervals: Bajaj Auto (₹100.00), Bosch (₹250.00), Dixon Technologies (₹100.00)
- Mid-tier stocks typically have ₹20.00 or ₹50.00 intervals
- Lower-priced stocks have smaller intervals: ₹1.00, ₹2.50, or ₹5.00

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an informational circular providing the current strike price interval structure for equity derivatives trading.

## Compliance Requirements

## Important Dates

Circular issued: December 19, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - This circular standardizes strike price intervals for options trading, ensuring uniform market structure across derivatives. The specified intervals facilitate liquidity concentration at standard strikes and help market makers in pricing options.

**Trading Impact:** Traders and market makers must be aware of the specific strike intervals for each security when placing orders or creating strategies. The wide range of intervals (₹1 to ₹250) reflects the diverse price ranges of underlying securities.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal - This appears to be a reference document codifying existing strike intervals rather than introducing new changes. Trading systems and risk management platforms should already be configured with these intervals.
