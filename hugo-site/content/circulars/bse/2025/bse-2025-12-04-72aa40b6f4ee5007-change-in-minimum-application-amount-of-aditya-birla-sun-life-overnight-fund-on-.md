title: Change in Minimum Application Amount of Aditya Birla Sun Life Overnight Fund
  on BSE StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited has revised the minimum application amount for the Growth Option of Aditya Birla Sun Life Overnight Fund. The minimum investment requirement has been reduced from Rs. 500 to Rs. 100, with multiples of Re. 1 thereafter. This change is effective from Thursday, December 4, 2025, and represents Addendum No. 52/2025 to the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM).

## Key Points

- Minimum application amount reduced from Rs. 500 to Rs. 100 for Growth Option
- Investment multiples remain at Re. 1 thereafter
- Change applies to Aditya Birla Sun Life Overnight Fund only
- Addendum No. 52/2025 issued to update SID and KIM
- All other terms and conditions of the scheme remain unchanged
- Lower entry barrier improves accessibility for small investors

## Regulatory Changes

This is a scheme-specific operational modification and does not constitute a regulatory change. The amendment is issued as a Notice-cum-Addendum that forms an integral part of the Scheme Information Document and Key Information Memorandum. The change has been implemented by Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited in its capacity as Investment Manager for Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements for market participants. The change is internal to the mutual fund scheme and affects only:

- **Investors**: Can now invest with a minimum of Rs. 100 instead of Rs. 500 in the Growth Option
- **Distributors**: Should update systems and investor communications to reflect the new minimum amount
- **The AMC**: Required to update SID and KIM documents with this addendum

All investments remain subject to standard mutual fund regulations and documentation requirements.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: Thursday, December 4, 2025
- **Notice Date**: December 3, 2025
- **Addendum Number**: 52/2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a scheme-specific operational change with no broader market implications.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for retail investors. The 80% reduction in minimum investment (Rs. 500 to Rs. 100) lowers the entry barrier, making the overnight fund more accessible to small investors and those looking to invest smaller amounts regularly.

**Operational Impact**: Limited to Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund distribution channels and systems. Platform partners like BSE StAR MF will need to update their systems to accept the new minimum amount.

**Fund Impact**: May lead to increased participation from small investors and potentially higher number of transactions with smaller ticket sizes. This aligns with the goal of financial inclusion and making investment products accessible to a broader investor base.
