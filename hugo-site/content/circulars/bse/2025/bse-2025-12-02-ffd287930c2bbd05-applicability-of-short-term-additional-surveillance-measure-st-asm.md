## Regulatory Changes

This is a routine periodic update to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework. The ST-ASM is a preventive surveillance measure applied to securities showing abnormal price movements or unusual trading patterns over short periods (5/15/30 days).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of securities under ST-ASM and applicable trading restrictions
- Securities in ST-ASM are subject to enhanced surveillance and may have additional margin requirements
- Price bands and other trading conditions may apply to these securities
- Members should update their systems to reflect the changes in surveillance status

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 03, 2025
- **Circular Date**: December 02, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The ST-ASM framework impacts liquidity and trading conditions for the affected securities. Securities entering ST-ASM may experience reduced trading volumes due to enhanced margin requirements and closer monitoring. The movement of 7 securities out of ST-ASM (some to stricter frameworks like LT-ASM or ESM) indicates ongoing surveillance actions. Traders and investors in these securities should be aware of the surveillance status and associated trading restrictions. The inclusion of multiple SME scrips reflects heightened surveillance on smaller companies with potential volatility concerns.
