## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - All equity trading members must participate and configure systems for DR connectivity. Requires technical preparation and testing of backup infrastructure.

**Market Impact**: Low - Mock trading session on Saturday (non-trading day) with no impact on regular market operations.
