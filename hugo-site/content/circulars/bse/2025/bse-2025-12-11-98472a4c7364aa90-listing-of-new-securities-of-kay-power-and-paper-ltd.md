## Impact Assessment

This is a company-specific listing with minimal market-wide impact. The preferential allotment increases Kay Power And Paper Ltd's equity base by 31 lakh shares. The majority of shares (30 lakh) are subject to lock-in until June 30, 2027, which limits immediate trading liquidity. Only 1 lakh shares will be freely tradable from June 30, 2026. This is a routine corporate action with impact limited to existing and potential investors in Kay Power And Paper Ltd.

- **1,00,000 shares** (Dist. Nos. 34840001 to 34940000): Locked-in until June 30, 2026
