## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: This circular has medium operational impact specifically for EGR segment participants. Trading members, clearing members, and depositories involved in gold receipts trading must organize their settlement operations according to this schedule.

**Market Scope**: Limited to EGR segment only - does not affect equity, derivatives, or other debt segments.

**Planning Requirements**: Members need to ensure adequate fund and securities arrangements for 21 settlement cycles, particularly around weekend gaps where pay-out dates extend to the following Monday.

**Auction Management**: The parallel auction settlement schedule requires members to maintain readiness for auction participation with early morning deadlines (8:50 AM) throughout the month.
