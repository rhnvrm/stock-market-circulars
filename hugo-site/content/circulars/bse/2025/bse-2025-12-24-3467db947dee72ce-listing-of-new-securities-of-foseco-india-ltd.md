## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed that the new securities are permitted for trading from December 26, 2025
- All 11,50,800 shares are subject to mandatory lock-in restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date:** November 12, 2025
- **Trading Commencement:** December 26, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry:** June 30, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. The preferential issue represents additional equity capital for Foseco India Ltd. However, the complete lock-in of all shares until June 30, 2026, means these shares will not be available for trading in the secondary market for approximately six months, minimizing immediate supply-side pressure on the stock price. The issue to non-promoters at a significant premium (Rs. 5,664.12 over face value) indicates investor confidence in the company's valuation.
