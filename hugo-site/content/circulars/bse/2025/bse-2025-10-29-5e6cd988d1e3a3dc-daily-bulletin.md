- Trading members should note securities with trading flag 0 will not be available for trading during book closure period

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to Medium - Routine corporate actions that provide positive returns to shareholders through dividends and bonus issues. The Fineotex bonus issue and stock split may attract short-term trading interest.

**Investor Impact**: Medium - Investors holding these securities as of record dates will receive benefits. Those trading around record dates should be aware of ex-dividend/ex-bonus dates to make informed decisions.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Standard corporate action processing by depositories and registrars. Trading suspensions (flag 0) for BIRLASOFT and Chambal Fertilisers during book closure periods require attention from trading members.
