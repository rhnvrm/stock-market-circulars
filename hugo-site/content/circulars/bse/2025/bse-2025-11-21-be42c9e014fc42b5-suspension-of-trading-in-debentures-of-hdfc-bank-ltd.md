---

## Summary

BSE has announced suspension of trading in specific non-convertible debentures of HDFC Bank Limited (ISIN: INE040A08351, Code: 953107) effective November 28, 2025. The suspension is due to the company setting a record date of November 29, 2025 for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the specified date.

## Key Points

- Debenture series affected: HDFCBL-8.35%-15-12-25-PVT (INE040A08351)
- BSE scrip code: 953107
- Record date: November 29, 2025
- No dealings permitted from: November 28, 2025
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Notice number: DR-766/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action notification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any deals in the specified debentures from November 28, 2025
- Members are required to note the suspension and inform their clients accordingly
- Normal trading restrictions apply before record date for corporate actions

## Important Dates

- **November 21, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 28, 2025**: Trading suspension begins (no dealings permitted)
- **November 29, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **December 15, 2025**: Expected redemption date (based on debenture series name)

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this affects a single debenture series of HDFC Bank in the private placement category. The suspension is a routine corporate action procedure to facilitate orderly redemption and interest payment to eligible debenture holders. Equity trading in HDFC Bank remains unaffected. The 8.35% coupon debenture series is reaching its scheduled maturity, and the suspension ensures only entitled holders as on record date receive the redemption proceeds and final interest payment.
