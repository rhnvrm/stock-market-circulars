## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational circular with limited market-wide impact. The auction mechanism is a standard settlement procedure to address delivery shortages. Impact is confined to specific trading members who have failed to deliver securities in the listed scrips. The large quantity in MANGALAM IND (10 million shares) may indicate a significant shortage requiring attention from the concerned parties. For most market participants and investors, this circular has minimal direct impact.
