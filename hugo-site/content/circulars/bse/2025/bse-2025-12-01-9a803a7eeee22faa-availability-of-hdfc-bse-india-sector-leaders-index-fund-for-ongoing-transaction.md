  StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

BSE has announced that HDFC BSE India Sector Leaders Index Fund will reopen for ongoing subscription and redemption transactions along with Systematic Investment Plan (SIP), Systematic Transfer Plan (STP), and Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) facilities on the BSE StAR MF Platform effective December 02, 2025. This follows an earlier notice (20251106-15) that temporarily suspended these transactions. Both Regular Plan and Direct Plan growth options are covered under this reopening.

## Key Points

- HDFC BSE India Sector Leaders Index Fund reopening for all ongoing transactions from December 02, 2025
- Available facilities include subscription, redemption, SIP, STP, and SWP
- Two plan options available: Regular Plan - Growth (ISIN: INF179KC1JX8) and Direct Plan - Growth (ISIN: INF179KC1JY6)
- Both schemes are categorized under Equity
- This supersedes earlier Notice No. 20251106-15 which likely suspended these transactions

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an operational notification regarding platform availability.

## Compliance Requirements

- BSE Members should update their systems to enable transactions for the specified scheme from December 02, 2025
- Members must ensure the correct ISINs are configured for both Regular and Direct plan options

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 01, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 02, 2025 - Scheme reopens for ongoing transactions on BSE StAR MF Platform

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine operational update affecting a single mutual fund scheme's availability on the BSE platform.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for existing and prospective investors in HDFC BSE India Sector Leaders Index Fund who can resume transactions including systematic investment and withdrawal facilities.

**Operational Impact**: BSE Members need to ensure their trading systems are updated to allow transactions in this scheme from the effective date. The scheme was previously unavailable (as per reference to Notice No. 20251106-15), and this notice restores full transaction capabilities.
