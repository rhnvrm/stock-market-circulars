## Summary

BSE has activated the SMART Switch feature for HELIOS SMALL CAP FUND – NFO on the BSE StAR MF platform.

The circular provides the mapping between subscription schemes and transaction reporting schemes.

## Key Points

- Two switch options available: Direct Plan and Regular Plan
- Source fund: HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND (Growth option)
- Destination fund: HELIOS SMALL CAP FUND – NFO
- Transaction reporting to be done to AMC/RTA under respective HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND schemes

## Scheme Mapping Details

- Subscription Scheme: HELIOS SMALL CAP FUND - NFO SMART SWITCH - HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND-DIRECT PLAN-GROWTH
- Transaction Reporting Scheme: HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND-DIRECT PLAN-GROWTH

**Regular Plan:**
- Subscription Scheme: HELIOS SMALL CAP FUND - NFO SMART SWITCH - HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND-REGULAR PLAN-GROWTH

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational activation of an existing platform feature.

## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers and distributors should update their systems to recognize the SMART Switch scheme codes
- Transaction reporting to AMC/RTA must be done under the correct source scheme (HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND)
- Proper mapping must be maintained between subscription and reporting schemes

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Negligible. This is a facility enhancement specific to one mutual fund house's NFO.
