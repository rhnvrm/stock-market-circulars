## Summary

Computer Age Management Services Ltd (Scrip Code: 543232) has announced a sub-division (stock split) of its equity shares. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs. 10/- will be subdivided into five equity shares with a face value of Rs. 2/- each. The record date for this corporate action is December 5, 2025, and the new share structure will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Record date: December 5, 2025
- Effective date: December 5, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE596I01012) for Rs. 10/- paid-up shares will become invalid from December 5, 2025
- New ISIN for Rs. 2/- paid-up shares will be communicated separately
- Trading members have been notified of this corporate action

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action involving stock sub-division in accordance with existing regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that the existing ISIN No. INE596I01012 (Rs. 10/- paid-up) will not be valid for transactions on or after December 5, 2025
- Market participants must await notification of the new ISIN for Rs. 2/- paid-up shares
- All trading and settlement systems must be updated to reflect the new share structure from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: December 5, 2025 - Date for determining shareholders eligible for stock sub-division
- **Effective Date**: December 5, 2025 - Date from which subdivided shares with Rs. 2/- face value will be effective for trading
- **ISIN Validity**: Existing ISIN invalid from December 5, 2025 onwards

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The stock split will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the per-share price proportionally. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors. The total market capitalization remains unchanged.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers, depositories, and trading systems need to update their records to reflect the new share structure and ISIN. Shareholders will see their shareholding quantity increase by 5x with a corresponding decrease in per-share price.

**Trading Impact**: The old ISIN will cease to be valid for trading from December 5, 2025, and all trades must use the new ISIN once notified. There may be temporary adjustments in derivative contracts if applicable.
