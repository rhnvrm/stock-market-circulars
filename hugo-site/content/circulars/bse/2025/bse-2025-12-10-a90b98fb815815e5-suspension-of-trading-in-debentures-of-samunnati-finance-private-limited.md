## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The suspension affects only one specific series of debentures of a private limited company. Liquidity in these debentures is already restricted given the private nature of the issuer.

**Investor Impact**: High for existing debenture holders - They cannot exit their positions before redemption. However, this is a planned corporate action with advance notice.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Standard procedure for debt securities approaching redemption dates. Trading members have established processes for handling such suspensions.

**Financial Impact**: Debenture holders will receive interest payment and redemption proceeds as per the terms. The 8.25% coupon rate will be paid along with principal redemption.
