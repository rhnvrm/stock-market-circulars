## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of 5 securities into higher stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. Four securities are moving to GSM Stage III (Mathew Easow Research Securities Ltd, JMG Corporation Ltd, Sparkle Gold Rock Ltd, and Tacent Projects Ltd), while one security (Woodsvilla Ltd) is moving to GSM Stage IV, the highest surveillance level.

## Key Points

- 4 securities moving to GSM Stage III: Mathew Easow Research Securities (511688), JMG Corporation (523712), Sparkle Gold Rock (530037), and Tacent Projects (531887)
- 1 security moving to GSM Stage IV: Woodsvilla Ltd (526959)
- Securities can move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM Framework (marked #) or IBC Framework (marked $)
- GSM stage progression indicates increasing surveillance concerns

## Securities Affected

### Moving to GSM Stage III:
1. **Mathew Easow Research Securities Ltd** (Code: 511688, ISIN: INE963B01019)
2. **JMG Corporation Ltd** (Code: 523712, ISIN: INE745F01011)
3. **Sparkle Gold Rock Ltd** (Code: 530037, ISIN: INE618F01010)
4. **Tacent Projects Ltd** (Code: 531887, ISIN: INE149D01011)

### Moving to GSM Stage IV:
1. **Woodsvilla Ltd** (Code: 526959, ISIN: INE374J01020)

## Regulatory Framework

The Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) is a framework implemented by BSE to enhance market surveillance and investor protection. Securities are placed in different stages based on various parameters including price movements, volume fluctuations, and other market surveillance criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors holding these securities should be aware of additional surveillance measures applicable to GSM securities
- Higher GSM stages typically involve stricter monitoring and may have trading restrictions
- Market participants must comply with enhanced due diligence requirements for GSM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 11, 2025 (circular date)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Movement to higher GSM stages can significantly impact trading activity in these securities. Stage III and Stage IV classifications typically result in reduced liquidity, increased margin requirements, and heightened scrutiny from regulators.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding these securities may face additional trading restrictions and should exercise caution. The progression to higher surveillance stages indicates potential concerns regarding price volatility, unusual trading patterns, or corporate governance issues.

**Market Perception:** GSM classification often negatively impacts market sentiment toward affected securities, potentially leading to price corrections and reduced investor interest.
