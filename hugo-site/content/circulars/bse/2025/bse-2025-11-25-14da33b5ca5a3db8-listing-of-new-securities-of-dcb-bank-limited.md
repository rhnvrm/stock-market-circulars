## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low immediate trading impact as all shares are locked-in for 5 years. The preferential allotment increases promoter holding, which may be viewed positively as it demonstrates promoter commitment.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members can view these shares in the system but they are non-tradeable due to lock-in restrictions. The shares increase the total issued capital of DCB Bank Limited.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders experience dilution of approximately 2-3% depending on pre-allotment share capital. However, the capital raise strengthens the bank's equity base.
