## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. ESOP/ESOS issuances are routine corporate actions representing employee compensation. The quantities being listed are relatively small compared to the outstanding share capital of these companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible immediate impact on stock liquidity. These shares typically remain with employees and may not immediately enter trading circulation.

**Dilution Impact**: Minor dilution for existing shareholders, as ESOP issuances are generally factored into fully diluted share calculations.

**Sector Coverage**: Diverse sectors represented including banking (ICICI Bank, Federal Bank), healthcare (Max Healthcare), technology (Syrma SGS), finance (Aditya Birla Capital, Shriram Finance, India Shelter), pharmaceuticals (J.B. Chemicals), and others.
