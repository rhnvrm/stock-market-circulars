These shares were issued to a Non Promoter on a preferential basis pursuant to the conversion of warrants at an issue price of Rs. 417/- per share (face value Rs. 2/- plus premium of Rs. 415/-). The shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares and are subject to lock-in until June 30, 2026.

## Key Points

- Distinguished numbers: 170105238 to 170153199

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following SEBI guidelines for preferential allotment and warrant conversion.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must take note of the new securities available for trading from December 18, 2025
- Lock-in restrictions must be observed: all 47,962 shares (Dist. Nos. 170105238 to 170153199) are locked-in until June 30, 2026
- Shares to be treated as ranking pari-passu with existing equity shares for all corporate actions

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment**: November 12, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: December 18, 2025
- **Lock-in Period Expiry**: June 30, 2026
- **Notice Date**: December 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The addition of 47,962 equity shares represents a relatively small increase to Black Box Limited's equity base. The preferential allotment to a Non Promoter through warrant conversion is a routine corporate action.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible immediate impact as all newly listed shares are subject to lock-in until June 30, 2026, preventing their trading in the market during this period.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect, though the quantum is small. The issue price of Rs. 417/- per share (Rs. 2/- face value + Rs. 415/- premium) indicates the valuation at which the warrants were converted.
