---

## Summary

BSE has updated its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective August 28, 2025, adding 3 new securities to ESM and moving 13 existing securities to higher ESM stages. No securities are moving to lower stages or exiting the framework.

## Key Points

- No securities moved to lower ESM stages
- No securities exited the ESM framework
- Consolidated list shows securities across ESM Stage I and Stage II
- Framework includes both main board and SME securities

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities that exhibit price movement patterns requiring closer monitoring. Securities in higher ESM stages face stricter trading controls and surveillance.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with enhanced surveillance measures for affected securities
- Trading in ESM securities subject to additional monitoring and restrictions
- Brokers and investors should be aware of ESM classifications when trading affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 28, 2025 - All ESM framework changes become effective

Investors and traders dealing with these securities should expect increased scrutiny and possible impact on liquidity. The measures are designed to protect market integrity and prevent excessive speculation.
