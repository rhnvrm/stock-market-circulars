## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) is a risk management framework applied to securities showing abnormal price movements or volume patterns. Securities in this framework face enhanced surveillance including price bands, trade-for-trade settlement, or other restrictions based on the ASM stage.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the enhanced surveillance conditions applicable to newly added securities
- Trading in affected securities will be subject to ST-ASM framework conditions from November 13, 2025
- Investors should be aware of potential trading restrictions including additional margin requirements or delivery-based settlement
- For securities moving to other frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM, GSM), respective framework conditions will apply

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 13, 2025 - All ST-ASM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of 7 securities to ST-ASM indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny due to unusual price/volume behavior. These securities will face trading restrictions designed to curb excessive speculation.

**Investor Impact**: Traders in the 7 newly listed securities should expect stricter trading conditions. The 17 securities exiting ST-ASM may see normalized trading conditions, though some are moving to other surveillance frameworks with their own restrictions.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members must update their systems to reflect the new surveillance categorization and ensure appropriate margin and settlement processes are applied from November 13, 2025.
