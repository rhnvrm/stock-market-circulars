## Summary

SEBI has approved amendments to Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2018 and Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 2018 to strengthen governance of Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs). The amendments mandate appointment of Executive Directors for critical verticals, establish reporting structures, and enhance oversight mechanisms. The provisions come into force on December 20, 2025.

## Key Points

- MIIs must appoint Executive Directors for Vertical 1 (Critical Operations) and Vertical 2 (Regulatory, compliance, risk management and investor grievances)
- EDs shall be members of the Governing Board of the MII
- Appointments must be through open advertisement in national dailies
- At least two candidates must be forwarded to SEBI for approval without order of preference
- ED compensation requires prior SEBI approval and cannot be changed without Board approval
- EDs report to the Managing Director for all purposes
- Public Interest Directors must conduct annual performance evaluation of EDs
- Standing Committee on Technology (SCOT) to hold separate quarterly meetings with ED of Vertical 1
- MIIs facing genuine difficulties may seek time-bound exemptions on case-by-case basis

## Regulatory Changes

## Impact Assessment

**Market-Wide Impact:**

The amendments represent a significant governance reform affecting all Market Infrastructure Institutions. The growth in market capitalization, trading volumes, technology adoption, and investor base has amplified the critical role of MIIs, making robust governance essential to prevent adverse impacts on securities markets and the broader economy.

**Institutional Impact:**

- Enhanced accountability through mandatory ED positions for critical operations and regulatory functions
- Improved checks and balances with EDs as Governing Board members
- Greater independence in technology oversight through SCOT's separate meetings with ED of Vertical 1
- Potential exemptions available for smaller or developing MIIs facing genuine difficulties

**Operational Impact:**

- MIIs must establish formal recruitment processes for senior leadership positions
- Additional governance layer requiring SEBI approval for appointments and compensation
- Enhanced transparency through open advertisement requirements
- Strengthened oversight of critical operations, technology, and regulatory compliance functions

**Stakeholder Impact:**

Based on feedback from stakeholders, public comments, and recommendations from SEBI's Secondary Market Advisory Committee (SMAC), these provisions aim to ensure MIIs act primarily in public interest given their critical role in market infrastructure.
