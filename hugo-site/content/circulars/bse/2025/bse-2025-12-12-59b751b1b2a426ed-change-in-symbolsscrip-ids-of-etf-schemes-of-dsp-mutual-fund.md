## Summary

BSE has notified trading members about changes to the trading symbols and scrip IDs of four Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) schemes managed by DSP Asset Managers Private Limited. The changes are administrative in nature and will be implemented in BSE systems effective December 15, 2025. All other aspects of the ETF schemes remain unchanged.

## Key Points

- Four DSP ETF schemes are undergoing symbol/scrip ID changes
- DSP Nifty Bank ETF: BANKETFADD → BANKADD (Scrip Code: 543738, ISIN: INF109K1A344)
- DSP NIFTY IT ETF: ITETFADD → ITADD (Scrip Code: 543935, ISIN: INF740KA1SX1)
- DSP GOLD ETF: GOLDETFADD → GOLDADD (Scrip Code: 543903, ISIN: INF740KA1SW3)
- DSP Nifty 50 ETF: NIFTY50ADD → NIFTYADD (Scrip Code: 543440, ISIN: INF740KA1CL0)
- Changes requested by DSP Asset Managers Private Limited
- ISIN and scrip codes remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an administrative update to standardize or simplify trading symbols for DSP ETF schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect new symbols/scrip IDs
- Members should ensure systems are updated before December 15, 2025
- For clarifications, contact:
  - AMC: Mr. Pritesh Majmudar (Compliance Officer) at DSP Asset Managers
  - Exchange: Mr. Parag Jain (Manager - Listing Compliance & Operations) at 022-2272 8685 or direct.listing@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 12, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 15, 2025 - New symbols will be reflected in BSE systems

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a purely administrative change affecting trading system identifiers. The underlying ETF schemes, their ISIN codes, scrip codes, and all other characteristics remain unchanged. Trading members need to update their systems to use the new shorter symbols when placing orders from December 15, 2025 onwards. Investors are not directly affected as their holdings remain intact.
