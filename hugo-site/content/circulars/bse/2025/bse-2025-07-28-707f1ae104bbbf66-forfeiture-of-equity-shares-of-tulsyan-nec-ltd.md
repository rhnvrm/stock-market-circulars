## Summary

BSE has issued a circular regarding the forfeiture of equity shares of Tulsyan NEC Ltd. The circular contains detailed reconciliation data for partly paid shares as of February 25, 2025, showing DNR (Do Not Register) loaded and not loaded shares as of January 23, 2025.

## Key Points

- Forfeiture involves both NER 6/- PP (Partly Paid) and NEP 3/- PP (Partly Paid) shares
- Reconciliation data shows various folio numbers, certificate ranges, and share quantities
- Data includes transfer details with certificate numbers and share holdings
- Multiple categories of partly paid shares are affected in the forfeiture process

## Share Categories Affected

**NER 6/- PP Shares:**
- Various folios ranging from 39033 to 39236
- Share quantities ranging from 5 to 36,609 shares
- Certificate numbers and distribution details provided

**NEP 3/- PP Shares:**
- Folios ranging from 39037 to 39262
- Share quantities ranging from 4 to 20,000 shares
- Detailed certificate ranges and transfer information

## Compliance Requirements

- Shareholders holding partly paid shares in the affected folios need to be aware of the forfeiture
- Certificate holders should verify their holdings against the reconciliation data
- Transfer agents and depositories must update records accordingly

## Important Dates

- Reconciliation data as of: February 25, 2025
- DNR status as of: January 23, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The forfeiture will reduce the issued share capital of Tulsyan NEC Ltd and affect shareholders who held partly paid shares. This is a routine corporate action for shares where call money has not been paid by shareholders within the stipulated timeframe.
