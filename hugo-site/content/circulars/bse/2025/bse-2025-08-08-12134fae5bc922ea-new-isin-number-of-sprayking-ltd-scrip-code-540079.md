  to Re.1
---

## Summary

BSE has assigned a new ISIN number INE537U01037 for SPRAYKING LTD (Scrip Code: 540079) following the subdivision of equity shares from Rs.2 per share to Re.1 per share. The new ISIN will be effective for trades executed on and from August 12, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: SPRAYKING LTD (Scrip Code: 540079)
- New ISIN Number: INE537U01037
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.2/- to Re.1/-
- Ex-Date: August 12, 2025
- Document Reference: DR-693/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

The new ISIN number replaces the previous ISIN for SPRAYKING LTD equity shares following the approved share subdivision. This is a continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20250731-19 dated July 19, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number
- All trades from the ex-date must use the new ISIN INE537U01037
- Settlement and clearing processes must reflect the new share denomination

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: August 8, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: August 12, 2025 (when new ISIN becomes effective)
- **Previous Notice Reference**: July 19, 2025 (Notice No. 20250731-19)

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on trading and settlement systems as market participants need to update their records with the new ISIN. The share subdivision increases the number of shares while reducing the face value, potentially improving liquidity and affordability for retail investors. Trading members must ensure system readiness before the ex-date to avoid settlement issues.
