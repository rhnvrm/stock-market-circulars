## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with limited market impact. The trading suspension affects only holders of these specific Muthoot Finance NCD series approaching maturity. Debenture holders will receive their principal and final interest payment as per the terms. The suspension prevents trades after the record date to ensure proper allocation of redemption proceeds. No impact on Muthoot Finance's equity shares or other debt securities not listed above.
