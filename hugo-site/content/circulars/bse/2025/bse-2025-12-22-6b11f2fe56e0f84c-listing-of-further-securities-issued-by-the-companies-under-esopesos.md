## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced in this circular. This is a routine notification of securities listing under existing ESOP/ESOS framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should update their systems to reflect the new shares available for trading
- Companies must ensure proper disclosure of the ESOP allotments as per SEBI guidelines
- Trading members should verify ISIN and scrip codes before executing trades

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 22, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: December 23, 2025 (Tuesday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not Applicable (NA) - no shares are under lock-in

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this listing is minimal as ESOP shares represent a small percentage of the total outstanding shares for most companies. The largest issuance is from HDFC Bank (2.07 million shares), which is negligible compared to its total market capitalization. None of the shares are under lock-in, allowing immediate liquidity. This is a routine administrative action that facilitates employee stock option exercise and does not materially affect market dynamics or trading patterns.
