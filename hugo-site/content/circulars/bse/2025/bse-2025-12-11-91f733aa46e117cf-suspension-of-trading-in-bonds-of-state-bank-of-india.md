**Operational Impact**: Standard procedure for bond maturity; bondholders on record date will receive final interest payment and principal redemption. No trading disruption beyond the specific scrips mentioned.

**Investor Impact**: Bondholders must hold positions through record date to receive redemption proceeds and final coupon payment. No secondary market liquidity available during suspension period.
