## Impact Assessment

This segment change is positive for the stock as it moves from the restrictive Trade for Trade segment to normal Rolling segment. Trade for Trade segments typically impose limitations such as same-day settlement and no intraday squaring off, which restricts liquidity. The move to M Group (Rolling segment) will enable normal T+1 settlement, intraday trading, and improved liquidity for MOTHER NUTRI FOODS LIMITED shares. This transition is typically granted after a stock demonstrates compliance and stability post-IPO listing on the SME platform.
