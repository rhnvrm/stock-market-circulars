## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions are part of BSE's surveillance mechanism to manage excessive volatility in specific securities. The exchange has categorized securities based on risk assessment and market behavior patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with new price band limits from August 18, 2025

This surveillance measure aims to protect investors from excessive price fluctuations while maintaining market liquidity.
