## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in equity shares of Lords Mark India Ltd (Scrip Code: 501261) effective November 20, 2025 (Settlement DR-760/2025-2026). The suspension is due to a capital reduction exercise pursuant to a Resolution Plan approved by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai Bench. The plan involves extinguishment of entire promoter and promoter group shareholding and reduction of public shareholding to maintain a minimum of 5%.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension effective from November 20, 2025 (Settlement DR-760/2025-2026)
- Record Date fixed as November 20, 2025 for reduction of share capital
- Complete extinguishment and cancellation of entire shareholding of existing Promoters and Promoter Group
- Public shareholding to be maintained at minimum 5% after implementation
- Resolution Plan approved by Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai Bench
- Trading members advised not to deal in equity shares from the suspension date

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of NCLT-approved Resolution Plan mandating:
- Capital reduction through extinguishment of promoter shareholding
- Cancellation of public shareholding with minimum 5% retention requirement
- Compliance with tribunal order for corporate restructuring

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in equity shares of Lords Mark India Ltd from November 20, 2025
- Market participants must note the suspension and cease trading activities
- Company to implement capital reduction as per NCLT order
- Maintenance of minimum 5% public shareholding post-implementation

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** November 19, 2025
- **Record Date:** November 20, 2025
- **Suspension Effective Date:** November 20, 2025
- **Settlement Number:** DR-760/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - Complete trading suspension prevents all market transactions in the scrip. Existing shareholders face liquidity freeze.

**Shareholder Impact:** Critical - Promoter and promoter group shareholders face complete extinguishment of their holdings. Public shareholders face significant dilution or cancellation, with only 5% public float remaining.

**Operational Impact:** The NCLT-approved Resolution Plan represents a major corporate restructuring that fundamentally alters the ownership structure of the company. The extinguishment of promoter shareholding is an unusual step typically associated with insolvency resolution or distressed asset restructuring.

**Investor Considerations:** Existing investors should seek professional advice regarding their rights and potential compensation mechanisms under the Resolution Plan. The drastic reduction in public shareholding raises concerns about future liquidity and market depth for this security.
