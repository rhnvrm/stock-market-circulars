## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this is a preferential allotment to promoters with full lock-in restrictions until August 2027. The allotment represents additional equity capital for the company but will not create immediate trading liquidity due to lock-in provisions. Trading members should update their records to reflect the increased share capital of Uday Jewellery Industries Limited.
