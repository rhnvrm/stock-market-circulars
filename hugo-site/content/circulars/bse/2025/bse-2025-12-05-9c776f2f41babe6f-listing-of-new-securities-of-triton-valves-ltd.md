## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date:** October 1, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - The listing involves a relatively small number of shares (80,000) with lock-in provisions, limiting immediate liquidity impact. The preferential allotment to Promoters and Non-Promoters through warrant conversion indicates planned capital infusion.

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal - With 50% of shares locked until 2027 and remaining 50% until 2026, the immediate impact on tradable float is negligible.

**Investor Consideration:** Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect, though the small size limits material impact on ownership percentages.
