## Regulatory Changes

BSE Surveillance Department has implemented revised price band restrictions as a market safety measure. Price bands limit the maximum price movement (up or down) a stock can experience in a single trading session. The stricter bands (2%, 5%) indicate higher surveillance concerns, while wider bands (20%) allow more price discovery while still maintaining some control.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their trading systems to reflect the new price bands before October 13, 2025
- Orders exceeding the revised price band limits will be rejected
- Members should inform their clients about the revised price band restrictions for affected securities
- Surveillance team contact: bse.surv@bseindia.com for clarifications

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 10, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 13, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements for 61 securities, potentially reducing speculative trading and volatility. Tighter bands (2-5%) suggest elevated surveillance concerns for those specific stocks.

**Trading Impact:** Traders and investors in these securities will face stricter price movement limits, which may impact liquidity and price discovery in the short term. Day traders and momentum traders will be particularly affected.

**Investor Protection:** The measure aims to protect retail investors from excessive volatility and potential price manipulation in these securities, most of which are small/mid-cap stocks with lower liquidity.
