title: Clarifications to Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) for
  SEBI Regulated Entities
---

## Summary

BSE has issued clarifications regarding the implementation of SEBI's Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) for regulated entities. The clarifications address two key areas: the methodology for determining total registered clients and the categorization criteria for trading members engaged in both clientele and proprietary trading.

## Key Points

- Registered clients count should be based on Unique PAN including active and inactive status
- Clients marked as 'Closed' in UCC database should be excluded from the count
- Trading members with clientele turnover less than 10% of proprietary turnover will be categorized as proprietary stockbrokers
- Clarifications issued in consultation with SEBI following multiple previous circulars and FAQs

## Regulatory Changes

The circular clarifies two specific parameters for CSCRF implementation:

1. **Client Count Determination**: The parameter for registered clients shall be based on Unique PAN, including clients with status reported as Active and Inactive by trading members, while excluding clients marked as Closed in the UCC database.

2. **Trading Member Categorization**: Trading members engaged in both clientele and proprietary trading will be considered proprietary stockbrokers for CSCRF purposes if their clientele trading turnover is less than 10% of their proprietary trading turnover during the financial year (April 1 to March 31).

## Compliance Requirements

- Investment Advisors must implement the clarified guidelines for CSCRF compliance
- Trading members must assess their trading turnover ratio to determine appropriate categorization
- Entities must use the specified methodology for counting registered clients
- All SEBI regulated entities must align their CSCRF implementation with these clarifications

## Important Dates

- Notice Date: September 2, 2025
- Financial Year Period for Assessment: April 1 to March 31
- References previous circulars dated: August 20, 2024, December 31, 2024, March 28, 2025, April 30, 2025, August 28, 2025
- FAQ Reference: June 11, 2025

## Impact Assessment

These clarifications will impact how regulated entities implement cybersecurity frameworks and may result in reclassification of some trading members from clientele to proprietary category based on turnover ratios. This could affect the applicable compliance requirements and cybersecurity standards for affected entities. Investment advisors and trading members must review their client counting methodology and trading turnover patterns to ensure proper categorization under the CSCRF guidelines.
