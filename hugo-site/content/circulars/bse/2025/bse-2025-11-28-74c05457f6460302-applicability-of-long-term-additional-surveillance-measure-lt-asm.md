- **Circular Date:** November 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The changes affect 22 securities with varying impacts:

- **New LT-ASM securities** will face enhanced surveillance, potential price bands, and additional margin requirements
- **Securities moving to higher stages** will experience stricter surveillance measures
- **Securities moving to lower stages** will see some relaxation in surveillance intensity
- **Securities exiting to other frameworks** (Trade for Trade, ESM, GSM, IBC) may face different or potentially more stringent restrictions
- Market liquidity in affected securities may be impacted due to surveillance measures
- Investors should exercise caution when trading in LT-ASM securities as they indicate heightened regulatory scrutiny
