## Summary

Titan Intech Ltd (Scrip Code: 521005) has announced a subdivision of its equity shares effective September 8, 2025. Each existing equity share of Rs.10 face value will be subdivided into 10 equity shares of Re.1 face value each.

## Key Points

- Company: Titan Intech Ltd (Scrip Code: 521005)
- Record Date: September 8, 2025
- Subdivision Ratio: 1:10 (One share of Rs.10 becomes Ten shares of Re.1)
- Effective Date: September 8, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE807M01023) will become invalid from record date
- New ISIN for Re.1 paid-up shares to be announced separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE807M01023 for Rs.10 paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after September 8, 2025. A new ISIN number for Re.1 paid-up shares will be communicated through separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note the subdivision details and ensure proper handling of transactions post-record date. Investors holding dematerialized securities will automatically receive subdivided shares in their accounts.

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: September 8, 2025
- **Effective Date**: September 8, 2025
- **ISIN Validity**: Current ISIN invalid from September 8, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This is a standard corporate action that increases share liquidity by reducing the nominal value per share. Existing shareholders will hold 10 times more shares at 1/10th the face value, maintaining the same investment value. The subdivision may improve affordability and trading volumes for retail investors.
