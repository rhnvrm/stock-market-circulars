## Key Points

- Two G-Secs available for auction: 6.01% GS 2030 (Rs 18,000 cr) and 7.09% GS 2074 (Rs 12,000 cr)
- Both securities are re-issues with minimum subscription units of 100 and multiples thereof
- Bidding platform: NCB-GSec module on BSE's iBBS system (https://ibbs.bseindia.com)

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must submit bids through the designated NCB-GSec module only
- Bids must comply with minimum subscription units of 100 and multiples thereof
- Bid amounts must be between Rs 10,000 (minimum) and Rs 2 crores (maximum) per security

## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium operational impact on BSE trading members and direct investors participating in the government securities market. The total auction size of Rs 30,000 crores provides liquidity opportunities in the debt market. The staggered bidding deadlines for direct investors (November 20) versus trading members (November 21) ensures smooth operational processing. Trading members need to coordinate with Trading Operations and ICCL Operations teams for technical and settlement-related matters. The availability of both short-tenure (2030) and long-tenure (2074) securities caters to different investment horizons and portfolio strategies.
