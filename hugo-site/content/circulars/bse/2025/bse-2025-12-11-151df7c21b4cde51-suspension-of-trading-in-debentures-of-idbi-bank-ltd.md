BSE has announced the suspension of trading in specific non-convertible debentures of IDBI BANK LTD (ISIN: INE008A08V00, Scrip Code: 953179) effective December 15, 2025. The suspension is necessitated by the company's decision to proceed with early redemption of these debentures, with the record date fixed for December 15, 2025. Trading members are advised not to deal in these securities from the specified date.

## Key Points

- IDBI Bank debentures with 8.62% coupon rate maturing on December 31, 2030 will be suspended from trading
- ISIN: INE008A08V00, Scrip Code: 953179 (Private Placement)
- Purpose: Early redemption of non-convertible debentures
- Circular Reference: DR-777/2025-2026
- Issued by: Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance And Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action procedure for early redemption of debt securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealings in the specified debentures from December 15, 2025
- Trading members are required to take note of the suspension and ensure compliance
- No transactions should be executed in these securities after the no-dealings date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 11, 2025
- **Record Date**: December 15, 2025
- **No Dealings From**: December 15, 2025
- **Original Maturity Date**: December 31, 2030 (now subject to early redemption)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of this specific debenture series. Debenture holders on record as of December 15, 2025, will be eligible for early redemption proceeds.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to prevent trading in these securities. Debenture holders will receive early redemption instead of holding until 2030 maturity.

**Liquidity Impact**: Trading liquidity for these debentures ceases from December 15, 2025. Investors seeking to exit positions must do so before the suspension date.

**Investor Impact**: High for current debenture holders who need to be aware of the early redemption. The suspension provides only a 4-day notice period from announcement to implementation.
