title: Change in Status of Era Infra Engineering Ltd from Delisted to Suspended
---

## Summary

BSE has announced a change in the status of Era Infra Engineering Ltd (Scrip Code: 530323) from "Delisted" to "Suspended" effective December 1, 2025. This change is necessitated by a moratorium declared by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The company was originally delisted by BSE on July 4, 2018.

## Key Points

- Era Infra Engineering Ltd was delisted from BSE on July 4, 2018 (Notice No. 20180702-28 dated July 02, 2018)
- NCLT has declared a moratorium on the company
- Company status will change from "Delisted" to "Suspended" effective December 1, 2025
- Scrip Code: 530323
- Trading members requiring clarification can email: bse.delistscn@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

The regulatory status change from "Delisted" to "Suspended" reflects the company's current position under NCLT proceedings with moratorium protection. This is a procedural change to align the company's BSE status with its legal standing under insolvency proceedings.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance actions are required from trading members. This is an informational notice regarding the status change. Trading members may seek clarification by emailing bse.delistscn@bseindia.com if needed.

## Important Dates

- **July 4, 2018**: Original delisting date of Era Infra Engineering Ltd
- **November 27, 2025**: Notice date
- **December 1, 2025**: Effective date for status change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this circular is minimal as it affects only one company that has been non-trading since 2018. The status change to "Suspended" is a technical adjustment reflecting the NCLT moratorium and does not restore trading in the scrip. This is primarily relevant for record-keeping and regulatory classification purposes rather than active market operations.
