## Regulatory Context

- SEBI letter no. SEBI/HO/OW/IMD-II/DOF3/25095/2022 dated June 17, 2022 set limits on overseas investments by mutual funds
- Mutual funds can make overseas investments only up to headroom available without breaching limits as of February 1, 2022 at mutual fund level
- Previous notice cum addendum dated August 13, 2025 had informed investors about subscription limits

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors cannot make new lump sum investments in the 7 designated schemes from October 16, 2025

- New SIP/STP registrations limited to Rs 5,000 per PAN per day
- SID/KIM of designated schemes will be amended to reflect these changes

## Important Dates

- **October 15, 2025**: Last date for unrestricted transactions (before cut-off time)
- **October 16, 2025**: Effective date of subscription restrictions

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: High - Investors seeking to invest in these offshore schemes face significant restrictions. New investors cannot make lump sum investments and are limited to Rs 5,000 per day through SIPs/STPs. Switch-ins from other schemes also blocked.

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects flow of funds to international markets through these 7 schemes. Reflects broader industry challenge of overseas investment limits constraining fund house operations.

**Operational Impact**: Existing systematic investments continue unaffected, providing some stability for current investors. However, new investors have severely limited access to these international/offshore equity opportunities through Edelweiss platform.
