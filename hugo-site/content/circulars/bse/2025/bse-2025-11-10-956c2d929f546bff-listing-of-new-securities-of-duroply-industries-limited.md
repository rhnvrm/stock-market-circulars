## Compliance Requirements

Trading members should note the listing of these new securities and ensure proper tracking in their systems.

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: September 25, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: November 11, 2025
- **Lock-in Period Expiry**: May 30, 2026 (for all 9,85,220 shares)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action involving listing of securities from warrant conversion. The lock-in period until May 30, 2026 applies to all the newly listed shares (Dist. Nos. 9868704 to 10853923). The addition represents dilution to existing shareholders but follows standard preferential allotment procedures. Limited market-wide impact as this affects only one company.
