## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium impact on debt market participants. The total auction size of Rs. 28,000 crores represents significant government borrowing activity. The re-issuance of existing securities (rather than new issuance) indicates continuation of government financing through established instruments.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and direct investors participating in government securities market need to prepare bids within specified timelines. The staggered bid collection deadlines (direct investors by December 11, 5 PM; members by December 12, 8 AM) provide operational flexibility.

**Liquidity Impact**: The two securities offer different maturity profiles (2040 and 2065), catering to varied investment horizons. The maximum bid limit of Rs. 2 crores per security through non-competitive route ensures retail/smaller institutional participation alongside competitive bidding.

**Contact Support**: Multiple support channels provided for user ID creation, bidding queries, and settlement-related issues through BSE Trading Operations and ICCL Operations teams.
