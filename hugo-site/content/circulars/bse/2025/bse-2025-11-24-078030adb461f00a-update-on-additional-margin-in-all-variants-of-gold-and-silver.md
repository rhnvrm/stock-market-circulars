## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Moderate impact on commodity derivatives traders dealing in Gold and Silver contracts. The continued additional margin requirements increase the capital commitment needed for positions in these contracts during tender periods.

**Operational Impact**: Clearing members must ensure adequate margin funding arrangements are in place for clients holding positions in the specified Gold and Silver contracts. The higher margin for Silver (4.5%) compared to Gold (1%) reflects relative risk assessments.

**Risk Management**: The continuation of additional margins demonstrates ICCL's ongoing focus on systemic risk mitigation in commodity derivatives, particularly for precious metals during delivery periods when volatility may increase.
