  31, 2025

## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that two banking scrips - Union Bank of India (UNIONBANK#) and Yes Bank Limited (YESBANK#) - will not be available for trading in the T+0 rolling settlement cycle on Wednesday, December 31, 2025. This restriction is specific to same-day settlement trading only.

## Key Points

- Two scrips excluded from T+0 trading on December 31, 2025
- Affected securities: Union Bank of India (Scrip Code: 132477) and Yes Bank Limited (Scrip Code: 132648)
- Restriction applies only to T+0 rolling settlement cycle
- Regular T+1 settlement trading remains unaffected
- Notice issued on December 2, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a specific operational restriction for a single trading day.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must ensure these two scrips are not traded in T+0 settlement cycle on December 31, 2025. Regular settlement cycle trading can continue as normal.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 2, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 31, 2025 (Wednesday)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. The restriction affects only same-day settlement trading for two banking stocks on year-end date. Traders can still execute transactions in regular T+1 settlement cycle. This appears to be a precautionary measure for year-end processing and will not affect the overall trading or liquidity of these securities.
