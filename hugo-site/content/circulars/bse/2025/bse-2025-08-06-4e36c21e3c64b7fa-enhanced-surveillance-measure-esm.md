- Kreon Finnancial Services Ltd (Scrip Code: 530139, ISIN: INE302C01018)
- Skyline Millars Ltd (Scrip Code: 505650, ISIN: INE178E01026)

## ESM Framework Structure

The framework operates in multiple stages (Stage I and Stage II) with varying levels of surveillance measures. Securities marked with (*) indicate NSE alignment, while (#) denotes SME scrips.

## Impact Assessment

The ESM framework imposes enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions on listed securities. Moving to higher stages typically involves stricter surveillance measures, which may affect trading volumes and investor sentiment for the affected securities.
