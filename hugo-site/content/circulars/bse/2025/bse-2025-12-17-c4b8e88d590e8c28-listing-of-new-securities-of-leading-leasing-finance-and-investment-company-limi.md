The shares will commence trading on December 18, 2025, and are subject to lock-in until July 4, 2026.

## Key Points

- 1,00,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 1/- each issued at premium of Rs. 6.40/-
- Issue price: Rs. 7.40/- per share
- Issued to non-promoters on preferential basis pursuant to warrant conversion
- Shares ranking pari-passu with existing equity shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are informed of the new securities listing and must ensure compliance with standard trading procedures for these shares. The lock-in restrictions must be observed until the specified date.

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date:** November 13, 2025
- **Trading Commencement:** December 18, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry:** July 4, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing of preferential allotment shares following warrant conversion. The issuance represents dilution to existing shareholders but provides capital to the company. The lock-in period of approximately 7 months provides stability by preventing immediate selling pressure. Market impact is expected to be minimal given the lock-in provisions and the issuance to non-promoters.
