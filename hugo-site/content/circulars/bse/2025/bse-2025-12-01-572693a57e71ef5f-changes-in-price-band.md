## Summary

BSE has revised the price band for 35 scrips with effect from December 02, 2025.

- Members can seek clarifications at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

The Exchange has revised price bands from their existing levels as a surveillance measure. Price bands limit the maximum price movement (both upward and downward) allowed for a security in a single trading session. Tighter price bands (2-5%) indicate heightened surveillance and reduced trading flexibility, while wider bands (10-20%) allow more price discovery.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must enforce the revised price bands in their trading systems from December 02, 2025
- All orders and trades must comply with the new price band limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact the Surveillance department at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: December 01, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 02, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The revised price bands will impact trading liquidity and volatility for the 35 affected securities. Tighter price bands (2-5%) restrict intraday price movements, potentially reducing volatility but also limiting price discovery and liquidity. Securities with 2% bands face the most stringent restrictions, suggesting they are under enhanced surveillance measures. The 20% band for two securities indicates relatively normal trading conditions. Traders and investors in these securities should adjust their trading strategies to account for the reduced daily price movement limits.
