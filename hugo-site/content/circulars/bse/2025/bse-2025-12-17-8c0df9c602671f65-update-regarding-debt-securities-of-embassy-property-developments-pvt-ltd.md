## Impact Assessment

The extension of the redemption date by approximately 29 months represents a material change to the debt security terms, potentially affecting investor portfolios and maturity planning. The ISIN change requires system updates across trading platforms and back-office operations. This modification may impact yield calculations and duration metrics for portfolios holding these securities. Trading members and investors should reassess their investment strategies based on the extended maturity profile. The change affects a single issuer's debt instruments and is operationally manageable with proper system updates.
