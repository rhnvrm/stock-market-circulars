## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that two banking stocks - Union Bank of India (UNIONBANK#) and Yes Bank Limited (YESBANK#) - will not be available for trading in the T+0 rolling settlement cycle on Wednesday, December 31, 2025. This is a temporary restriction applicable only to the specified date.

## Key Points

- Union Bank of India (Scrip Code: 132477, Symbol: UNIONBANK#) excluded from T+0 trading
- Yes Bank Limited (Scrip Code: 132648, Symbol: YESBANK#) excluded from T+0 trading
- Restriction applies only to December 31, 2025
- Notice issued by BSE Trading Operations on December 2, 2025
- Only affects T+0 settlement cycle, not regular settlement cycles

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a temporary operational measure for the specified date.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must ensure these two scrips are not traded in the T+0 settlement cycle on December 31, 2025. Regular settlement cycles remain available for these securities.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 2, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 31, 2025 (Wednesday)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. The restriction is limited to two scrips for one trading day and only affects the T+0 settlement option. Traders can still transact these securities through regular T+1 settlement. This appears to be a year-end operational measure, likely related to settlement processing during the calendar year transition.
