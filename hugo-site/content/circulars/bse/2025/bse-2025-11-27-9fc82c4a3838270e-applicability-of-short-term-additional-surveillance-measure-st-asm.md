## Regulatory Framework

The ST-ASM framework is a surveillance measure implemented to address concerns related to price volatility and protect investor interests. Securities can be placed under different stages (I, II, III) based on the severity of concerns. The framework applies to:

- Regular equity securities
- SME (Small and Medium Enterprise) scrips
- T+0 trading scrips (based on parent company assessment)

Securities may move out of ST-ASM if included in other frameworks such as LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge Framework, or ESM.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the updated surveillance status of affected securities
- Trading in these securities will be subject to ST-ASM framework conditions
- Enhanced due diligence required for securities under surveillance
- Investors should be aware of increased monitoring and potential trading restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities added to ST-ASM will face enhanced surveillance measures, which may include additional margin requirements, price bands, or other restrictions. This typically results in reduced liquidity and increased volatility awareness.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should exercise increased caution. The surveillance designation indicates BSE has identified concerns warranting closer monitoring.

**Market Impact**: Limited broader market impact as changes affect only 10 securities. However, the continued use of ST-ASM demonstrates ongoing regulatory vigilance in protecting market integrity and investor interests.
