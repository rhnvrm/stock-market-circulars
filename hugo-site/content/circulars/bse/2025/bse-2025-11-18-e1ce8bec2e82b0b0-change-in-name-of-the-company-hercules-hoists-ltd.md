**Market Impact**: Minimal to none. This is an administrative change that does not alter the company's business operations, financial position, or shareholder rights.

**Operational Impact**: The company will need to update all statutory documents, letterheads, signage, and corporate communications to reflect the new name while maintaining dual display for two years.
