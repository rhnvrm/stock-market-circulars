## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to medium. The preferential issue of 1.215 crore shares represents a significant dilution event for existing shareholders. However, the lock-in provisions (ranging from approximately 18-19 months from allotment) will prevent immediate selling pressure.

**Liquidity Impact:** Moderate increase in total outstanding shares, though locked-in shares will not contribute to tradable float until May 2026.

**Company Impact:** Capital raise at par value suggests fundraising for business expansion or working capital requirements. The defense sector focus may attract investor interest given current market dynamics.
