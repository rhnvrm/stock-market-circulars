## Regulatory Framework

The Long Term ASM Framework is a surveillance mechanism applied to securities exhibiting unusual price movements or trading patterns. Securities under LT-ASM face:

- Enhanced surveillance monitoring
- Potential trading restrictions
- Progressive stage-based framework (Stage I through Stage IV)
- Price bands and other trading limitations
- Possible movement to Trade for Trade segment

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 24, 2025
- **Circular Date:** December 23, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - Securities under LT-ASM typically experience reduced liquidity and increased trading costs due to surveillance measures.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities will face stricter surveillance conditions, potential position limits, and reduced market liquidity. Stage I placement indicates initial surveillance level with possibility of escalation if concerns persist.

**Compliance Impact:** Trading members must ensure compliance with ASM framework requirements including additional margin requirements and client disclosures for transactions in these securities.
