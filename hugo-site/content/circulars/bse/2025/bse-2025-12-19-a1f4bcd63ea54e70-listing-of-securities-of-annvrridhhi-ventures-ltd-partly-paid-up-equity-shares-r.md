## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification with limited market-wide impact. The listing affects only Annvrridhhi Ventures Ltd. shareholders who participated in the rights issue. The partly paid-up structure means shareholders have future payment obligations (Rs. 7.50/- per share) at the Board's discretion. Trading members need to be aware of the new scrip code and ISIN for order processing. The X Group classification indicates these are securities with specific trading characteristics. The suspension of the temporary ISIN ensures proper dematerialization processes are followed.
