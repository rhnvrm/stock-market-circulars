## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to existing shareholders of Mangalam Industrial Finance Limited. The 5-day extension provides additional opportunity for eligible shareholders who have not yet exercised their rights to participate in the issue.

**Operational Impact**: The extension shifts all subsequent timelines including allotment (November 24), credit (November 28), and listing dates (December 3) by approximately 3-5 days from original schedule. This may affect shareholders' liquidity planning and trading strategies.

**Financial Impact**: The extension indicates potential lower-than-expected subscription levels, suggesting the company is seeking to maximize participation. At Re. 1.00 per share (par value), this is a deeply discounted rights offering that could significantly dilute existing shareholders who do not participate.

**Compliance Impact**: Standard procedural extension with no compliance burden beyond updated disclosure requirements. Trading window restrictions on designated persons remain in effect as per insider trading regulations.
