  Code: 543232)'

## Summary

Computer Age Management Services Ltd (CAMS) has announced a sub-division (stock split) of its equity shares. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs. 10/- will be split into five equity shares with a face value of Rs. 2/- each. The record date for this corporate action is December 5, 2025, and the new share structure will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Company: Computer Age Management Services Ltd
- Scrip Code: 543232
- Current Face Value: Rs. 10/- per equity share
- New Face Value: Rs. 2/- per equity share
- Split Ratio: 1:5 (One share of Rs. 10/- into five shares of Rs. 2/-)
- Record Date: December 5, 2025
- Effective Date: December 5, 2025
- Current ISIN: INE596I01012 (Rs. 10/- paid up)
- Notice Reference: DR-771/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE596I01012 for shares with Rs. 10/- face value will not be valid for transactions on the exchange on or after December 5, 2025. A new ISIN number for shares with Rs. 2/- face value will be communicated to the market through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date of December 5, 2025 for the sub-division
- All transactions from December 5, 2025 onwards must use the new ISIN for Rs. 2/- shares
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new share structure and ISIN
- The old ISIN (INE596I01012) should be discontinued for transactions from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **November 24, 2025**: Circular announcement date
- **December 5, 2025**: Record date for sub-division
- **December 5, 2025**: Effective date for new share structure
- **December 5, 2025**: Last date for old ISIN validity

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The stock split will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5 times while reducing the per-share price proportionally. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors without changing the company's market capitalization.

**Trading Impact**: All pending orders, positions, and derivatives contracts may need adjustment. Trading members must ensure their systems are updated to handle the new ISIN and face value from December 5, 2025.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive five shares for every one share held as of the record date. The total value of holdings remains unchanged, but the number of shares increases and the per-share price decreases proportionally.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and depositories need to update their records and systems to reflect the new share structure and ISIN. The transition must be seamless to avoid disruption in trading activities.
