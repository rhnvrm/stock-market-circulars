title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular regarding the applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective October 21, 2025. The circular identifies securities exiting the ST-ASM framework, with 9 securities moving out due to inclusion in other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM or ESM). No new securities are being added to the ST-ASM framework, and no securities are moving between different ST-ASM stages. The consolidated list shows 17 securities currently in Stage I of the Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM framework.

## Key Points

- No new securities shortlisted for ST-ASM framework effective October 21, 2025
- 9 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework, transitioning to other surveillance measures
- 2 securities (Bits Ltd and Croissance Ltd) moving to LT-ASM Framework
- 2 securities (Earkart Ltd and Tarapur Transformers Ltd) moving to ESM Framework
- 5 securities (BlueStone Jewellery, Bothra Metals, Hybrid Financial, Jay Ushin, Keynote Financial) exiting ST-ASM with no specified alternate framework
- Consolidated list contains 17 securities in Stage I of ST-ASM
- Framework includes special markings for SME scrips (@), T+0 scrips (~), and various exit reasons

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to operate with its existing 5/15/30 Days structure, categorizing securities into different surveillance stages. Securities are being redistributed across surveillance frameworks including:

- Long Term ASM (LT-ASM) Framework
- Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework
- Trade for Trade Framework
- Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) Framework
- Pledge Framework

The framework applies different treatment for SME scrips and T+0 scrips based on parent company classification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the change in surveillance status for the 9 securities exiting ST-ASM
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new surveillance framework applicable to affected securities
- Entities must comply with the specific requirements of the new surveillance framework (LT-ASM or ESM) for securities transitioning out of ST-ASM
- Securities remaining in ST-ASM Stage I continue to be subject to short-term additional surveillance measures with applicable price bands and position limits

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 21, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework applicability become effective
- **Circular Date**: October 20, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The movement of 9 securities out of ST-ASM framework affects trading conditions and liquidity parameters for these stocks. Securities moving to LT-ASM or ESM will face different surveillance measures, potentially impacting trading volumes and investor participation.

**Operational Impact**: Market participants trading in the affected securities need to adjust to new surveillance parameters. Securities exiting ST-ASM may experience changes in price discovery mechanisms and trading restrictions based on their new framework classification.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding positions in the 9 securities moving out of ST-ASM should be aware of the changed surveillance status and associated trading restrictions that may apply under their new frameworks (LT-ASM or ESM).
