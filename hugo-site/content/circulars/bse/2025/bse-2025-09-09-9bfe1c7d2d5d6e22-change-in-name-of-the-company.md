## Summary

Ganesh Housing Corporation Limited has officially changed its name to Ganesh Housing Limited. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued a Certificate of Incorporation pursuant to change of name on August 14, 2025, making the name change effective from that date.

## Key Points

- Company name changed from "Ganesh Housing Corporation Limited" to "Ganesh Housing Limited"
- Certificate issued on August 14, 2025 by Central Processing Centre, Haryana
- Corporate Identification Number (CIN) remains L45200GJ1991PLC015817
- Company remains a company limited by shares
- Rights and liabilities of stakeholders unaffected by the name change

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is an administrative name change processed through the Ministry of Corporate Affairs under the Companies (Incorporation) Rules, 2014.

## Compliance Requirements

- Company must display old name along with new name for a period of two years at all places where company name display is required under Section 12 of the Companies Act
- All stakeholders advised to verify latest company status on MCA website www.mca.gov.in/MCA21

## Important Dates

- **August 14, 2025**: Effective date of name change
- **Next 2 years**: Period during which both old and new names must be displayed

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is purely an administrative name change. The company's business operations, CIN, registered address, and stakeholder rights remain unchanged. The shortened name may provide minor branding benefits but does not affect the company's financial or operational status.
