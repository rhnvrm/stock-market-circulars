**Investor Impact:** Investors holding these securities must be aware of record dates to claim their entitlements for dividends, interest, bonus shares, or participate in rights issues.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and clearing corporations need to process corporate action adjustments for futures and options contracts where applicable, and ensure proper credit of entitlements to beneficial owners.
