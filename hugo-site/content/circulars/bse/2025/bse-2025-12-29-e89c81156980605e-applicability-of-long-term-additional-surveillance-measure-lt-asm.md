## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective December 30, 2025. Six securities are being newly added to LT-ASM, two securities are being moved to higher surveillance stages, and three securities are exiting the framework due to inclusion in other surveillance measures (ESM).

## Key Points

- 6 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework
- 2 securities continuing in LT-ASM but moving to higher Stage II ASM (Shiva Granito Export Ltd, Uravi Defence and Technology Ltd)
- 3 securities moving out of LT-ASM due to inclusion in ESM Framework (Avance Technologies Ltd, Beryl Securities Ltd, PH Capital Ltd)
- No securities moving to lower surveillance stages
- No securities being directly placed in Stage IV ASM
- Changes effective from December 30, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The LT-ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or other concerns. Securities in this framework are subject to additional surveillance measures including:

- Enhanced margin requirements
- Price bands restrictions
- Periodic review for stage progression or exit
- Trade-for-trade settlement in higher stages

## Compliance Requirements

**For Market Participants:**
- Be aware of increased margin requirements for trading in affected securities
- Note applicable price bands and settlement mechanisms
- Review exposure to securities newly added or moved to higher surveillance stages

**For Listed Companies:**
- Companies whose securities are in LT-ASM should review reasons for inclusion
- Ensure compliance with disclosure requirements
- Address underlying concerns that led to surveillance inclusion

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 30, 2025 - All changes to LT-ASM framework take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Securities in LT-ASM face reduced liquidity due to higher margins and trading restrictions
- Movement to Stage II for 2 securities will result in stricter surveillance measures
- Exit of 3 securities from LT-ASM due to ESM inclusion indicates continued surveillance under different framework

**Investor Impact:**
- Investors holding affected securities should expect higher margin requirements
- Trading costs may increase due to additional surveillance measures
- Price discovery may be impacted by reduced trading activity

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers need to update margin systems for affected securities
- Risk management systems should reflect updated surveillance classifications
- Enhanced monitoring required for securities moving to higher stages
