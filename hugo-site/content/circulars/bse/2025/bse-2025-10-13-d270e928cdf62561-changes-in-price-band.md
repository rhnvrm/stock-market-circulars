## Compliance Requirements

- Trading systems must be configured to enforce the new price band limits
- Orders exceeding the revised price bands will be rejected
- Members should communicate these changes to their clients trading in affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 13, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 14, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements in these 11 securities, potentially reducing liquidity and trading volumes. Securities with 2% price bands face the most significant trading restrictions.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities will experience limited price discovery and reduced ability to exit positions quickly during volatile market conditions. The tighter bands may also increase the number of trading days required to complete large transactions.

**Market Sentiment:** Price band revisions typically indicate heightened surveillance due to concerns about volatility, speculation, or market manipulation. This may signal caution to market participants regarding these securities.
