All three companies responded on December 2, 2025, confirming they have no undisclosed information that could impact share prices and that all material disclosures have been made in compliance with SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

## Key Points

- **Wockhardt Limited** verified internal records and confirmed no pending announcements or events requiring disclosure under Regulation 30
- **Bandaram Pharma Packtech** stated no events or information affecting company operations/performance that could result in price increase
- All companies attributed volume increases to market-driven factors beyond their control
- All companies confirmed ongoing compliance with Regulation 30 disclosure requirements

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must respond to BSE surveillance queries regarding unusual price/volume movements
- Companies must confirm whether any undisclosed material information exists that could impact security prices
- Companies must verify compliance with Regulation 30 disclosure obligations
