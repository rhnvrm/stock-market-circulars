## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks as per SEBI guidelines.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to update their systems to reflect the new securities
- The listed companies must ensure proper disclosure of the allotment in their shareholding patterns
- Standard trading and settlement rules apply to these securities from the effective date
- Companies must comply with ongoing disclosure requirements related to ESOP exercises

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 5, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date:** December 8, 2025 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Period:** Not applicable (NA for all companies)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal to low. The total number of shares being listed represents a small fraction of the outstanding shares for most companies. ESOP allotments are routine corporate actions that typically have limited impact on stock prices.

**Liquidity Impact:** Marginal increase in tradable float for the 11 companies. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares are immediately available for trading, though the volumes are relatively small.

**Dilution Impact:** Minor dilution for existing shareholders across all 11 companies. The largest absolute allotment is 475,000 shares (Aditya Vision), which is still relatively small in the context of typical market capitalizations.

**Investor Considerations:** ESOP exercises often indicate employee confidence in the company's prospects. The lack of lock-in suggests employees may sell immediately if needed, though this is standard for ESOP shares. No immediate action required for existing shareholders or investors.
