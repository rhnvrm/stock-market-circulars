---

## Summary

A-1 Ltd (Scrip Code: 542012) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares, splitting each existing share of face value Rs.10/- into ten shares of face value Re.1/- each. The record date for this corporate action is January 8, 2026, and the new denomination will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Sub-division ratio: 1:10 (One equity share of Rs.10/- into ten equity shares of Re.1/-)
- Company: A-1 Ltd (Scrip Code: 542012)
- Record Date: January 8, 2026
- Effective Date: January 8, 2026
- Current ISIN (INE911Z01017) for Rs.10/- paid-up shares will become invalid for transactions from January 8, 2026
- New ISIN for Re.1/- paid-up shares to be communicated separately
- Notice Reference: DR-794/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action involving share sub-division as per existing regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date of January 8, 2026
- Members must ensure systems are updated to reflect the new share denomination
- Old ISIN (INE911Z01017) must not be used for transactions on or after January 8, 2026
- Members must await communication of new ISIN for Re.1/- paid-up shares and update systems accordingly
- All transactions from January 8, 2026 onwards must use the new ISIN only

## Important Dates

- **December 29, 2025**: Notice date
- **January 8, 2026**: Record date for sub-division
- **January 8, 2026**: Effective date for new denomination (Re.1/- per share)
- **January 8, 2026**: Date from which old ISIN becomes invalid for exchange transactions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares tenfold while reducing the face value proportionally, making shares more affordable and potentially improving liquidity. The per-share price will adjust accordingly in the market.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants must ensure their systems are updated to handle the new share denomination and transition to the new ISIN. There will be no trading disruption as the change is systematic, but participants must be prepared for the ISIN transition on the effective date.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive ten shares for every one share held as of the record date. The total value of holdings remains unchanged, but the number of shares increases proportionally.
