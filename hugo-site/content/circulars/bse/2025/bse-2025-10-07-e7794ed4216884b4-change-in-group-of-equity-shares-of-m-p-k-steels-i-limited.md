## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for M P K STEELS (I) LIMITED will transition from Trade for Trade (T2T) settlement to Rolling settlement. Trade for Trade segment typically requires immediate delivery and payment, while Rolling segment allows for standard T+1 settlement cycles with intraday trading opportunities.

- Trading Members should contact the specified BSE official for clarification or technical assistance
- Members must ensure proper categorization in their trading terminals before the effective date

- **October 6, 2025**: Circular published date
- **October 7, 2025**: Official notice date
- **October 20, 2025**: Effective date of group change to M Group

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The transition from MT Group (Trade for Trade) to M Group (Rolling segment) is positive for liquidity and trading activity. Investors will benefit from:

- Enhanced liquidity as the stock moves to regular rolling settlement
- Ability to conduct intraday trading (not permitted in T2T)
- Standard T+1 settlement cycle instead of compulsory delivery
- Potential for increased trading volumes and price discovery

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to reconfigure their systems and update client communications regarding the changed trading mechanism. The move indicates the company has likely met BSE's criteria for graduation from the more restrictive T2T segment, suggesting improved compliance or stability.
