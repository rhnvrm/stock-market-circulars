**Market Impact**: The stock will trade ex-rights from December 4, 2025, which typically results in a price adjustment to reflect the value transfer to rights holders. Trading members need to adjust their systems and client communications accordingly.

**Capital Raising**: At the offering price of Rs.27 per share with a 7:40 ratio, this represents a capital raising initiative for the company's funding requirements. The significant premium (Rs.26 over Re.1 face value) indicates confidence in the company's valuation.
