- Brokers and market participants should inform clients holding BEML shares about the upcoming sub-division
- System adjustments required to accommodate new ISIN and updated share structure
- All transactions from October 28, 2025 onwards should use the new ISIN (to be announced)

## Important Dates

- **October 14, 2025**: Notice date
- **October 28, 2025**: Last date for trading with old ISIN INE258A01016 (Rs. 10/- face value)
- **November 3, 2025**: Record date for sub-division
- **November 3, 2025**: Effective date - new share structure becomes operational

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares and reduce the per-share price proportionally, potentially improving liquidity and making shares more accessible to retail investors. No change to overall market capitalization.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems, portfolio management systems, and depositories need to update records to reflect the new share structure and ISIN. Shareholders will see their holdings doubled with proportional reduction in face value.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive two shares for every one share held as of the record date. The total investment value remains unchanged, but increased share count may improve trading liquidity.
