## Impact Assessment

This revised settlement schedule impacts shareholders who tendered their shares during the takeover offer period (27/10/2025 to 10/11/2025) for Cupid Breweries and Distilleries Limited. The revision extends the settlement timeline, with obligations now downloadable on 14/11/2025 instead of the originally scheduled date, and final settlement on 17/11/2025. Members and custodians need to adjust their settlement processes accordingly. The impact is moderate as it affects a specific takeover transaction rather than broader market operations.
