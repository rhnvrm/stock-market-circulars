## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine government securities auction that occurs regularly. The non-competitive bidding facility provides retail and smaller investors access to Treasury Bills without competing on price.

**Operational Impact**: Medium for debt market participants and trading members who wish to invest in risk-free government securities. The facility allows participants to access T-Bills through BSE's platform.

**Investor Impact**: Provides opportunity for investors seeking short-term government securities with tenors of 91 days, 182 days, and 364 days. The non-competitive route ensures allocation at the weighted average price discovered in the competitive auction.
