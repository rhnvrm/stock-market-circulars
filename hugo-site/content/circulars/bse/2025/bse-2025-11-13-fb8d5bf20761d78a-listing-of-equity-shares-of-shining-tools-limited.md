## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The listing adds a new equity security to BSE's trading platform. With approximately 27% of shares (1.5 million out of 5.66 million) being freely tradable from day one, there is reasonable liquidity available for investors.

**Investor Impact**: The staggered lock-in expiry dates (2026, 2027, and 2028) indicate a structured approach to share release, which can help prevent sudden supply shocks to the market. Investors should note that 73.5% of shares are currently locked-in, which may impact liquidity and price discovery in the initial trading period.
