No securities are moving to Stage 0, transitioning between stages, or being excluded from the framework in this update.

## Key Points

- No securities moved to Stage 0 (receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure)
- No securities transitioned from Stage I to Stage II or vice versa
- No securities excluded from ASM for IBC framework
- Consolidated list maintains multiple securities across different IBC stages including companies like Aban Offshore, AGS Transact Technologies, Alchemist Ltd, and others
- Framework includes special markings for T+0 scrips and recommencement scrips

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements the ongoing IBC surveillance framework with stage-based monitoring:

- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from company regarding insolvency matters
- **Stage 1**: Additional Surveillance Measure for companies in active Insolvency Resolution Process
- **Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance for advanced insolvency proceedings

Special categories include securities marked with (~) for T+0 scrips shortlisted in IBC framework as per parent company, and (^) for recommencement scrips.

## Compliance Requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 12, 2025 - Swan Defence And Heavy Industries Ltd enters Stage 1 IBC surveillance
- **Circular Date**: November 11, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - IBC Stage 1 classification indicates formal insolvency proceedings for Swan Defence And Heavy Industries Ltd, which typically results in increased volatility, higher trading margins, and reduced liquidity. Investors face elevated risk of capital loss.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under IBC surveillance face additional restrictions and monitoring, potentially including price bands, trading limits, and enhanced margin requirements. The consolidated list shows 13+ securities already under various IBC stages, indicating continued regulatory focus on distressed companies.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders of affected companies face significant uncertainty regarding recovery prospects. Stage 1 classification serves as a clear warning signal for heightened investment risk and potential delisting scenarios depending on resolution outcomes.
