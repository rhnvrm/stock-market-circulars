## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a company-specific listing that increases the outstanding shares of Sunrise Efficient Marketing Limited by 3.495 million shares. The lock-in period until May 15, 2026 means these shares will not be available for trading in the secondary market for approximately six months, limiting immediate supply impact.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Trading members need to note the lock-in restrictions when handling orders for this scrip. The shares are fungible with existing equity shares post lock-in period.

**Investor Impact**: Relevant only for existing shareholders and potential investors in Sunrise Efficient Marketing Limited. The preferential allotment represents dilution for existing shareholders, though shares were issued at a premium indicating positive valuation.
