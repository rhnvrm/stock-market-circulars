title: Revised Price Bands for 17 Securities Effective December 30, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 17 securities effective from December 30, 2025. The price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive), controlling the maximum daily price movement allowed for these scrips. This surveillance measure impacts trading volatility and requires traders to be aware of the new limits.

## Key Points

- 17 securities will have revised price bands effective December 30, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% to 20% depending on the security
- Most restrictive band (2%): Kiran Syntex Ltd, SRM Energy Ltd, VR Woodart Ltd
- Moderately restrictive bands (5%): Chemkart India Ltd, Dr Lalchandani Labs Ltd, K K Silk Mills Ltd, PH Capital Ltd
- Standard bands (10%): 8 securities including Baroda Extrusion Ltd, K&R Rail Engineering Ltd, Nagpur Power & Industries Ltd, among others
- Wider bands (20%): K. V. Toys India Ltd, TILAK VENTURES LIMITED
- Notice applies to equity segment trading members

## Regulatory Changes

The exchange has modified price band percentages from existing levels for surveillance purposes. Price bands are regulatory mechanisms that limit the maximum price movement (up or down) a security can experience in a single trading day, helping prevent excessive volatility and potential market manipulation.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands from December 30, 2025
- All trading systems must be updated to reflect new price band limits
- Orders exceeding the new price band limits will be rejected
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 29, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** The revised price bands will restrict intraday volatility for the affected securities. Stocks with tighter bands (2-5%) will experience more limited price movements, potentially reducing speculative activity but also limiting liquidity. Securities with wider bands (20%) allow greater price discovery.

**Investor Impact:** Investors and traders in these 17 securities need to adjust their strategies based on the new bands. Tighter bands may reduce profit opportunities for day traders but provide more price stability. Stop-loss orders and limit orders must be placed within the new band constraints.

**Market Impact:** This appears to be a surveillance measure targeting specific securities, likely due to unusual volatility patterns or other risk factors. The varied band percentages suggest differentiated risk assessment across the affected securities.
