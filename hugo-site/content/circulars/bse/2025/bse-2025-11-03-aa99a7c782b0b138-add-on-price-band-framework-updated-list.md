title: Add-on Price Band Framework - Updated List of 45 Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has published an updated list of 45 securities that are subject to the Add-on Price Band Framework. This surveillance measure restricts price movements in these securities to help protect investors and maintain market stability. The list includes companies across various sectors that have been placed under this enhanced monitoring framework.

## Key Points

- 45 securities are currently under the Add-on Price Band Framework
- List includes complete scrip codes, ISIN numbers, and company names
- Securities span multiple sectors including finance, manufacturing, infrastructure, and services
- Add-on price band acts as an additional surveillance measure beyond regular circuit filters
- Framework applies stricter price movement restrictions to protect market integrity

## Regulatory Changes

This is an updated list reflecting the current status of securities under the Add-on Price Band Framework. No new regulatory changes are introduced in this circular - it serves as a reference document for market participants to identify which securities are currently subject to this surveillance measure.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with Add-on Price Band restrictions for listed securities
- Brokers should inform clients about the special surveillance status of these securities
- Market participants must adhere to the stricter price movement limits applicable to these stocks
- Investors should be aware that these securities have restricted price bands due to surveillance concerns

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: November 3, 2025
- The list is effective immediately and reflects current surveillance status

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Securities on this list face restricted price movements, which can limit both upward and downward volatility. This may reduce liquidity and trading volumes in these stocks.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or considering these securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance measures, which typically indicate concerns about price manipulation, volatility, or other market integrity issues.

**Market Operations:** The Add-on Price Band Framework helps prevent excessive speculation and protects retail investors from sharp price movements in vulnerable securities. Trading members need to maintain updated systems to enforce these restrictions.
