## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must inform all clients about commencement of trading in REs, mentioning the ISIN
- Contract notes/bills containing purchase of REs must include prominent disclaimer informing clients that:
  - Purchase of REs only gives right to participate in ongoing Rights Issue by making application with requisite application money or renounce the REs before issue closes
  - REs which are neither subscribed nor renounced on or before Issue Closing Date shall lapse and be extinguished
- Clients must be informed that REs shall not be mistaken for ordinary shares of the company
- Trading Members should refer to notice no. 20200305-21 dated March 05, 2020 and notice no. 20200518-34 dated May 18, 2020 for further details

## Important Dates

- **October 7, 2025**: Circular notice date
- **October 10, 2025**: Rights Entitlements trading begins; Rights Issue opens
- **October 27, 2025**: Last day for Rights Entitlements trading/renunciation
- **October 31, 2025**: Rights Issue closes; REs must be subscribed or renounced by this date to avoid lapsing

## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium impact on existing shareholders of STAR HOUSING FINANCE LIMITED who hold rights entitlements. Shareholders can trade these entitlements in the secondary market during the specified period or use them to subscribe to the rights issue. The trade-for-trade settlement mechanism ensures transparency. Failure to act on REs before October 31, 2025 will result in their permanent lapsing, potentially affecting shareholder value if not managed appropriately.
