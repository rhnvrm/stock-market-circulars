title: Changes in Price Band for 37 Securities - Effective December 22, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced revisions to price bands for 37 securities effective from December 22, 2025. The changes include tightening of price bands ranging from 1% to 20%, with the most restrictive 1% band applied to SER Industries Ltd and 2% band to Chambal Breweries & Distilleries Ltd. These surveillance measures are typically implemented to curb excessive volatility in securities.

## Key Points

- 37 scrips will have revised price bands effective December 22, 2025
- Price bands range from 1% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive among revised securities)
- SER Industries Ltd faces the tightest restriction with 1% price band
- Chambal Breweries & Distilleries Ltd assigned 2% price band
- Multiple securities (15 stocks) assigned 5% price band
- 12 securities assigned 10% price band
- 5 securities assigned 20% price band
- Notice issued by BSE Surveillance Department on December 19, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions represent enhanced surveillance measures applied to specific securities. These restrictions limit the maximum price movement allowed during a trading session, serving as circuit filters to prevent excessive speculation and volatility. The varying levels (1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%) indicate different degrees of concern regarding price stability.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands from December 22, 2025
- All trading systems must be updated to reflect new price band limits
- Orders exceeding the revised price bands will be rejected by the trading system
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 19, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 22, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The revised price bands will significantly restrict intraday price movements for affected securities. Stocks with tighter bands (1-5%) will experience severe limitations on volatility, potentially reducing trading volumes and liquidity.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these securities will face limited ability to exit or enter positions at desired prices within a single trading session. Large orders may need to be executed over multiple days.

**Market Operations**: The 1% band on SER Industries and 2% band on Chambal Breweries indicate serious volatility concerns by the exchange. The 5% band applied to 15 securities suggests widespread surveillance actions across smaller-cap stocks.

**Surveillance Context**: These measures are typically applied to stocks exhibiting unusual price movements, low liquidity, or potential manipulation concerns. The tight restrictions aim to protect investors from excessive speculation.
