## Regulatory Changes

Price band restrictions have been modified from existing levels for the specified securities. Price bands are regulatory tools used to limit the maximum price movement of a security within a trading session, helping to curb excessive volatility and speculation.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement the revised price bands from December 02, 2025
- All trades in the affected securities must respect the new price band limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect the new price band parameters

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 01, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 02, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revised price bands will directly affect trading dynamics for these 35 securities. Tighter bands (2%) indicate higher surveillance concerns and will limit intraday price movements, potentially reducing liquidity and trading volumes. Securities with 20% bands may see increased trading activity as they have more room for price discovery.

**Trading Impact**: Day traders and short-term traders will need to adjust their strategies for securities with tighter bands. The 5% band (majority of affected scrips) represents moderate surveillance and will require careful position management.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these securities should be aware that tighter price bands may indicate underlying concerns about the scrip's volatility or corporate governance. The varied band levels (2% to 20%) suggest differentiated risk assessments by the exchange surveillance team.
