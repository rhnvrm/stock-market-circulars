## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to shareholders of DARSHAN ORNA LIMITED. Creates short-term trading opportunity for renunciation of rights entitlements.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure proper client communication, contract note disclaimers, and settlement procedures for RE transactions. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis requires operational readiness.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders must act within the 5-day renunciation window (November 13-17) or subscribe by November 21, otherwise REs will lapse and become worthless.
