Notable companies include major public sector banks (Bank of Baroda - 17,075 shares), steel manufacturers (Tata Steel - 4,600 shares), and various companies from infrastructure, technology, pharmaceutical, and financial services sectors.

## Key Points

- Settlement number: 732
- Auction date: October 10, 2025
- Total scrips involved: 97 companies
- Largest quantities: Sharanam Inf (30,770 shares), Trio Mercant (21,128 shares), Bank of Baroda (17,075 shares), Aspira Pathl (15,842 shares), Saatvik Gree (15,052 shares)
- Sectors affected: Banking, steel, real estate, pharmaceuticals, technology, infrastructure, textiles, and manufacturing
- Many scrips involve small quantities (1-100 shares), indicating retail or odd-lot settlement issues

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard operational auction notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Broker-dealers must fulfill their delivery obligations for the listed scrips
- Members with short positions in these securities must participate in the demat auction
- Settlement must be completed as per BSE auction settlement procedures
- Entities holding these securities should ensure proper demat account linkages

## Important Dates

- **Settlement Date**: October 10, 2025 (Settlement No. 732)
- Auction participants must adhere to BSE's prescribed timelines for auction settlement

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects 97 companies with varying liquidity profiles. Large-cap stocks like Bank of Baroda, Tata Steel, HCL Tech, and DLF have minimal quantities indicating isolated settlement issues rather than systemic problems.

**Operational Impact**: Broker-dealers with open positions in these scrips must arrange securities through the auction mechanism, potentially at unfavorable prices. The high number of small quantities suggests widespread settlement irregularities across multiple trading members.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders expecting delivery of these securities may face delays. The auction mechanism ensures settlement completion but may result in price differences that affect broker-client accounts.
