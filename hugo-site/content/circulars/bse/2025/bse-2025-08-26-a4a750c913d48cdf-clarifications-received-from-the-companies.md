## Summary

BSE received clarifications from two companies - Gandhi Special Tubes Limited (Scrip Code: 513108) and RateGain Travel Technologies Limited (BSE: 543417) - in response to exchange queries about significant increases in their securities' trading volumes on August 26, 2025.

- No undisclosed price sensitive information or pending announcements from either company
- Companies attributed volume increases to market conditions and market-driven factors
- Both companies reaffirmed commitment to continue making applicable disclosures within stipulated timeframes

## Company Responses

**Gandhi Special Tubes Limited:**
- Confirmed all events impacting operations and performance have been disclosed to both NSE and BSE
- Stated no pending information that may influence volume behavior
- Attributed volume increase to purely market conditions with no management involvement

**RateGain Travel Technologies Limited:**
- Confirmed compliance with disclosure requirements under SEBI LODR Regulations 2015
- No undisclosed price sensitive information or impending corporate actions
- Reassured continued adherence to regulatory disclosure requirements

## Regulatory Context

- Responses were to BSE surveillance queries under reference L/SURV/ONL/PV/AA/ 2025-2026 / 378 and 379
