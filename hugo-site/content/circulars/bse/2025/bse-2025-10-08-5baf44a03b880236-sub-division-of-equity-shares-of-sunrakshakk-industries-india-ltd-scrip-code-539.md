## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The sub-division will increase liquidity by reducing the price per share, potentially making it more accessible to retail investors. The 1:5 split ratio will quintuple the number of shares outstanding.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading systems, depositories, and broker platforms need to update share quantities and face values. The ISIN change requires technical updates across market infrastructure.

**Shareholder Impact**: Neutral to positive - Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares for every 1 share held, with no change in total investment value. Lower share price may improve marketability.
