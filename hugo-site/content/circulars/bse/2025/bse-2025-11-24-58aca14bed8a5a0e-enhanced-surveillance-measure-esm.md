## Regulatory Framework

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework is designed to:

- Monitor securities with abnormal price movements
- Protect investor interests
- Ensure market integrity
- Apply progressive surveillance stages based on continued concerns
- Higher ESM stages typically involve stricter trading restrictions

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the ESM stage classification for affected securities
- Securities under ESM may have additional margin requirements
- Trade-to-trade settlement or other restrictions may apply based on ESM stage
- Market participants should review risk management for securities under surveillance
- Clients must be informed about ESM status of securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 25, 2025
- All changes to ESM framework take effect from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The ESM framework affects liquidity and trading activity in the listed securities. Securities moving to higher stages face increased scrutiny and potentially stricter trading conditions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance status, which may indicate higher volatility, unusual price movements, or other market concerns that triggered the surveillance measures.

**Liquidity Impact**: Securities under ESM typically experience reduced liquidity due to additional margin requirements and heightened risk perception among market participants.

**SME Segment**: Special attention required for SME scrips (marked with #) as they may have additional vulnerabilities given smaller market capitalization and trading volumes.
