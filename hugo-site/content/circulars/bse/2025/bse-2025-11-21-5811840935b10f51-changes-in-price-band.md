title: Changes in Price Band for 35 Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for 35 securities effective from November 24, 2025. The changes involve different price band percentages ranging from 2% to 20%, with the majority of securities (26 out of 35) being assigned a 5% price band. These revisions are part of surveillance measures to regulate price movements in these scrips.

## Key Points

- 35 securities will have revised price bands effective November 24, 2025
- 26 securities revised to 5% price band
- 4 securities revised to 10% price band (CLN Energy Ltd, Colorchips New Media Ltd, Venus Remedies Ltd, Viji Finance Ltd)
- 1 security revised to 20% price band (Athena Constructions Ltd)
- 1 security revised to 2% price band (UTL Industries Ltd)
- Changes initiated by BSE Surveillance Department
- Members can contact bse.surv@bseindia.com for clarifications

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements surveillance-based price band revisions from existing levels. Price bands are used as a circuit breaker mechanism to limit extreme price volatility in securities. The tightening of price bands (lower percentages) indicates increased surveillance measures for these securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands from November 24, 2025
- All trades in the affected securities must adhere to the new price band limits
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect the new price band percentages
- Members should monitor these securities for any further surveillance actions

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 21, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revision of price bands will restrict the daily price movement range for these 35 securities. Tighter bands (especially 2% and 5%) will limit intraday volatility and may reduce trading volumes in these scrips. This is typically done for securities showing unusual price movements or as part of enhanced surveillance measures.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their risk management systems and inform clients about the revised price bands. The changes may affect order execution and limit orders that fall outside the new price band ranges.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities will experience limited price discovery within a narrower range, potentially affecting liquidity and the ability to enter or exit positions at desired prices.
