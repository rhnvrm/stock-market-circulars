title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Securities Moving to Higher GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of three securities into higher stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. Tejassvi Aaharam Limited (Security Code: 531628, ISIN: INE173E01019) and Binny Mills Ltd. (Security Code: 535620, ISIN: INE160L01011) are being moved to GSM Stage II. Yaari Digital Integrated Services Ltd (Security Code: 533520, ISIN: INE126M01010) is being moved to GSM Stage III, indicating more stringent surveillance requirements.

## Key Points

- Three securities are moving to higher GSM stages effective immediately
- Tejassvi Aaharam Limited moving to GSM Stage II
- Binny Mills Ltd. moving to GSM Stage II
- Yaari Digital Integrated Services Ltd moving to GSM Stage III (highest level among the three)
- Securities marked (#) may move lower in GSM Framework due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- Securities marked ($) may move lower in GSM Framework due to inclusion in IBC Framework
- Movement aligned with NSE as indicated by (*) notation

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework applies progressive surveillance measures to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or trading patterns. Higher GSM stages typically involve:

- Additional disclosure requirements
- Trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday squaring off)
- 100% upfront margin requirements
- Price bands and other trading restrictions
- Enhanced reporting obligations

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with enhanced margin requirements for these securities
- Clients trading in these securities must provide 100% upfront margins
- All trades will be settled on a delivery basis with no intraday trading permitted
- Brokers must inform clients about the GSM classification and associated restrictions
- Market participants should review their positions in affected securities

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: October 30, 2025 (as per circular date)
- The GSM stage changes are applicable from the date of this circular

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - Movement to higher GSM stages significantly restricts trading flexibility and reduces liquidity in affected securities. Stage III placement for Yaari Digital indicates serious concerns requiring maximum surveillance.

**Trading Impact:** Investors holding these securities will face trade-for-trade settlement requirements, eliminating intraday trading opportunities and requiring full upfront capital for purchases.

**Liquidity Impact:** Expected sharp decline in trading volumes due to stricter requirements, potentially widening bid-ask spreads and making position exits more challenging.

**Investor Considerations:** Current holders should evaluate their positions carefully. New investors should exercise extreme caution and thoroughly assess the reasons for GSM classification before investing in these securities.
