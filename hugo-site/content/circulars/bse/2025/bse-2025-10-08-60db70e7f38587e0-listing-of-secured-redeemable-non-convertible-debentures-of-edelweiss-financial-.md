## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact and is primarily relevant to debt investors and Edelweiss Financial Services Limited. The issuance provides Edelweiss with debt capital totaling approximately ₹240.5 crore (24.05 lakh NCDs × ₹1,000). The variety of tenures and payment structures offers investors flexibility in choosing debt instruments matching their cash flow requirements. The CRISIL A+/Stable rating indicates adequate safety with moderate credit risk. Zero-coupon series (II, V, VIII) offer higher redemption amounts (₹1,188.10, ₹1,313.30, and ₹1,611.00 respectively) reflecting accumulated interest. No put or call options are available on any series, meaning investors and the issuer cannot exercise early redemption rights.
