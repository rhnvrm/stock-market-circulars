**Market Impact**: Minimal. The shares represent employee compensation under established ESOP programs and constitute a small percentage of total outstanding equity for most companies. The largest issuance (Ujjivan SFB at 671,386 shares) represents approximately 0.02% dilution based on typical outstanding share counts.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible immediate impact as employees may not liquidate immediately. No lock-in restrictions provide flexibility for employees to trade.

**Corporate Impact**: Positive for employee retention and alignment with shareholder interests. Reflects continued use of equity-based compensation by companies across banking, fintech, technology, and healthcare sectors.
