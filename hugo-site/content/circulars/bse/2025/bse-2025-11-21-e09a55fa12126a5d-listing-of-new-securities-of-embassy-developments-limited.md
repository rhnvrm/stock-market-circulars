## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of preferentially allotted shares following warrant conversion. The lock-in periods on majority of shares (80,96,067 shares locked until May 2027) will limit immediate supply pressure on the stock.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in total tradable shares, though substantial portion remains locked for 18-31 months.

**Shareholder Impact**: Dilution of existing shareholders' stake due to preferential allotment to promoter and non-promoter entities. The shares rank equally with existing shares in terms of voting rights and dividends.
