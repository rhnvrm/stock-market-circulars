## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction involves 106 securities with varying quantities. While most quantities are small, some larger positions (Franklin Industries with 82,943 shares, SpiceJet with 25,000 shares) could see price volatility during auction.

**Operational Impact:** Affected brokers and their clients must participate in the auction to close out positions. Failure to deliver securities triggers the auction mechanism, potentially resulting in higher costs for defaulting parties.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders of listed companies may experience temporary price movements during the auction process. Those with short delivery obligations face potential losses if auction prices are unfavorable.
