## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects 101 different securities across multiple sectors. While routine in nature, the auction could cause temporary price volatility in the affected scrips, particularly those with larger quantities like IRB Infrastructure (50,000 shares).

**Operational Impact:** Medium - clearing members and brokers with outstanding delivery obligations must arrange securities or face auction consequences. The diversity of scrips (from large caps like Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank to smaller companies) indicates widespread settlement issues across the market.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - retail and institutional investors holding these securities may see short-term price movements during auction execution. Members with shortfalls will face auction costs.
