## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. ESOP/ESOS listings are routine corporate actions that typically have negligible impact on overall market liquidity or stock prices due to small quantities and lock-in restrictions.

**Operational Impact:** Administrative only. Affects record-keeping and shareholding disclosure for the specific companies involved.

**Investor Impact:** Limited to employees receiving stock options. Lock-in restrictions prevent immediate trading, minimizing dilution concerns for existing shareholders.
