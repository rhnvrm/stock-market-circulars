## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a standard IPO listing announcement for a single company.

**Liquidity Impact:** The lock-in provisions restrict the immediate tradeable float. Only 1,500,000 shares (approximately 26.4% of total listed shares) are immediately available for trading, while 4,158,400 shares (approximately 73.6%) are under various lock-in periods.

**Investor Impact:** Investors should be aware of the limited free float initially available for trading, which may impact liquidity and price discovery in the initial trading period. The staggered lock-in release over 1-3 years will gradually increase the tradeable supply.
