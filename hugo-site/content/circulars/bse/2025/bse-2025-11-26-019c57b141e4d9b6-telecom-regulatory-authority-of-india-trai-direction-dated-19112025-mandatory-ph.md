title: TRAI Mandates Phase-wise Adoption of 1600-Series Numbers for BFSI Sector
---

## Summary

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a Direction on November 19, 2025, mandating phase-wise adoption of the '1600' numbering series by entities in the Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) sector regulated by RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA. This initiative aims to enhance consumer trust, curb spam, and prevent fraudulent activities through voice calls by clearly distinguishing legitimate service and transactional calls from commercial communications. Approximately 485 entities have already adopted the 1600 series, subscribing to over 2,800 numbers.

## Key Points

- TRAI mandates time-bound adoption of 1600-series numbers for BFSI sector entities
- The 1600 series has been assigned by DoT to clearly distinguish legitimate calls from regulated financial institutions
- About 485 entities have already adopted the series with over 2,800 numbers subscribed
- Phase-wise implementation schedule developed in consultation with sector regulators through Joint Committee of Regulators (JCoR)
- Mandatory adoption aims to reduce risk of fraudulent calls impersonating trusted financial institutions
- Insurance sector timelines under discussion with IRDAI, to be notified separately

## Regulatory Changes

- Introduction of mandatory 1600-series numbering requirement for BFSI sector entities
- Replacement of standard 10-digit numbers with 1600-series for service and transactional calls
- Regulatory framework developed through collaboration between TRAI and BFSI sector regulators (RBI, SEBI, PFRDA)
- Other SEBI-registered intermediaries (beyond Mutual Funds, AMCs, and QSBs) may voluntarily migrate after registration verification
