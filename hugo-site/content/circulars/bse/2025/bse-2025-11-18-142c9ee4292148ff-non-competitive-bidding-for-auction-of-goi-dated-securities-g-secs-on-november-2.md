## Summary

BSE notifies trading members about the upcoming auction of Government of India dated securities on November 21, 2025, through the non-competitive bidding (NCB) facility.

## Key Points

- Total issue size: Rs 30,000 crores (Rs 18,000 crores + Rs 12,000 crores)
- Both securities are re-issues, not new issuances
- Minimum subscription: 100 units (Rs 10,000)
- Maximum bid amount: Rs 2 crores per security

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a routine G-sec auction providing investment opportunities in government debt securities. The re-issuance of existing securities adds liquidity to these specific G-secs.

**Operational Impact:** Low. Standard non-competitive bidding process using established BSE infrastructure. No changes to existing procedures or systems.

**Investor Impact:** Provides retail and institutional investors access to long-term government securities with maturities in 2030 and 2074. The non-competitive route allows smaller investors to participate without competing on price with primary dealers.
