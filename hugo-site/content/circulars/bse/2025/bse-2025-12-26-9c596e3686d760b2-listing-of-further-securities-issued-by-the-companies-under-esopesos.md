---

## Summary

BSE has announced the listing and admission to trading of additional securities issued by 21 companies under their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). The listing will be effective from Monday, December 29, 2025. A total of over 1.5 million shares across various companies will be listed, with no lock-in period applicable to any of the securities.

## Key Points

- 21 companies are listing additional shares issued under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Effective date of listing: December 29, 2025
- No lock-in period applies to any of the listed securities
- Major issuances include ICICI Bank (480,952 shares), Motilal Oswal (349,583 shares), RBL Bank (179,115 shares), and ICICI Prudential Life (161,107 shares)
- All securities are equity shares with varying face values (Re 1, Rs 2, Rs 4, Rs 5, and Rs 10)
- Companies span multiple sectors including banking, insurance, finance, manufacturing, and IT services

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard administrative listing notification for shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants are required to take note of the new securities being listed
- Trading systems should be updated to reflect the increased share capital for the 21 companies
- For clarifications, participants can contact BSE at 022-2272 8706/5878

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 26, 2025
- **Listing Effective Date**: December 29, 2025 (Monday)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine corporate action that marginally increases the outstanding share capital of the respective companies. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares are immediately available for trading.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible overall impact on market liquidity. While ICICI Bank's issuance of 480,952 shares represents the largest single issuance, this is a small fraction of the bank's total outstanding shares (over 7.15 billion shares post-listing).

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may experience minimal dilution. These shares were issued as part of employee compensation schemes and represent the exercise of previously granted options, which would have been accounted for in diluted earnings per share calculations.

**Operational Impact**: None. This is a routine listing process that does not affect trading operations or settlement procedures.
