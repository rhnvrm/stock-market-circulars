## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Existing shareholders of PATEL ENGINEERING LIMITED can trade their rights entitlements during the 5-day renunciation period, providing liquidity and flexibility for those who do not wish to participate in the rights issue.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure proper client communication and compliance with disclaimer requirements in contract notes. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis requires appropriate risk management and client funding arrangements.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders have the option to either subscribe to the rights issue, renounce their entitlements by trading them in the market during December 12-16, 2025, or let them lapse. Unexercised REs will be extinguished after the issue closing date.
