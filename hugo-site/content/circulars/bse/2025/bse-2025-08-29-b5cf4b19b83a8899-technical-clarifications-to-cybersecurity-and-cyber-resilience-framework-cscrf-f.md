title: Technical Clarifications to Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF)
  for SEBI Regulated Entities
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued technical clarifications to the Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) originally published in August 2024. This circular addresses queries from regulated entities and provides guidance for entities operating under multiple regulatory jurisdictions, technical implementation details, re-categorization of certain entities, and cyber security audit policy guidelines.

## Key Points

- Technical clarifications issued in four parts: multi-regulator principles, technical clarifications, re-categorization guidelines, and CERT-In audit policy
- Addresses entities regulated by multiple bodies (SEBI, RBI, etc.) including custodians, depository participants, and merchant bankers
- Follows previous clarifications and extensions issued between December 2024 and June 2025
- Comprehensive framework covers all SEBI regulated entities including AIFs, brokers, exchanges, mutual funds, and depositories

## Regulatory Changes

- Part-A establishes principles for entities under multiple regulators' purview
- Part-B provides technical implementation clarifications
- Part-C re-categorizes Portfolio Managers and Merchant Bankers
- Part-D incorporates CERT-In cyber security audit policy guidelines
- Framework applies to entities that may be primarily regulated by other bodies like RBI but have SEBI regulated activities

## Compliance Requirements

- All SEBI regulated entities must implement the cybersecurity framework with these technical clarifications
- Entities under multiple regulatory jurisdictions must follow specific guidance for compliance coordination
- Implementation must consider data protection and IT infrastructure security measures
- Compliance with cyber security audit requirements as per CERT-In guidelines

## Important Dates

- Original framework issued: August 20, 2024
- Current clarifications issued: August 28, 2025
- Previous extensions granted: March 28, 2025 and June 30, 2025
- Timeline for implementation follows previously extended deadlines

## Impact Assessment

- High impact on all SEBI regulated entities requiring cybersecurity framework adoption
- Significant compliance burden for entities operating under multiple regulatory frameworks
- Enhanced data protection and IT infrastructure security across the securities market ecosystem
- Streamlined approach for entities with overlapping regulatory requirements
