## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine listing of preferential allotment shares for a single company.

**Shareholder Impact:** Existing shareholders of Baroda Extrusion Ltd. should note the dilution effect of 45.33 million additional shares entering the market. However, the lock-in periods on the entire allotment (extending to 2026-2027) will prevent immediate supply pressure.

**Trading Impact:** Minimal immediate trading impact expected due to complete lock-in on all allotted shares. The shares will be available for trading technically from November 10, 2025, but actual free float will remain restricted until lock-in periods expire.
