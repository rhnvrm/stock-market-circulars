## Summary

BSE has announced the listing of 11,82,500 new equity shares of Manaksia Coated Metals & Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 539046) effective November 10, 2025. These shares were issued at a premium of Rs. 64/- per share (face value Re. 1/-) to non-promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to conversion of warrants. The shares are subject to lock-in until May 30, 2026.

## Key Points

- 11,82,500 equity shares of Re. 1/- each issued at premium of Rs. 64/-
- Total issue price: Rs. 65/- per share
- Issued to non-promoters on preferential basis through warrant conversion
- Shares ranking pari-passu with existing equity shares
- Date of allotment: July 4, 2025
- Trading commencement: November 10, 2025
- ISIN: INE830Q01018
- Distinctive Numbers: 105151551 to 106334050

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following preferential allotment procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are informed that:
- These securities are available for trading from November 10, 2025
- All 11,82,500 shares are subject to lock-in restrictions
- Lock-in period extends until May 30, 2026
- Normal trading and settlement procedures apply post-listing

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: July 4, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: November 10, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: May 30, 2026
- **Circular Issue Date**: November 7, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This represents a preferential allotment of 11.825 lakh shares resulting from warrant conversion. The lock-in period until May 30, 2026 ensures these shares will not be available for trading in the near term, minimizing immediate supply impact.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal. The locked-in shares will not affect immediate market liquidity. Post lock-in expiry in May 2026, the additional float may marginally improve liquidity depending on selling interest.

**Investor Impact**: The allotment to non-promoters at Rs. 65/- per share (allotted in July 2025) provides insight into the valuation at that time. Current shareholders should note the dilution from this preferential issue, though shares rank pari-passu with existing equity.
