title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities List Update
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework effective December 19, 2025. The circular identifies securities being newly included in ESM, those moving to higher or lower ESM stages, and securities exiting the framework. Three new securities have been added to ESM Stage I, while two existing securities are being moved to higher ESM stages.

## Key Points

- 3 new securities shortlisted for inclusion in ESM Framework: Aadi Industries Ltd, Agri-Tech (India) Ltd, and Shish Industries Ltd
- 2 securities moving to higher ESM stages: S.A.L. Steel Ltd and TVS Electronics Ltd
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages
- No securities exiting the ESM Framework in this update
- Consolidated list includes 28+ securities across different ESM stages (Stage I and Stage II)
- Changes take effect from December 19, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework continues to operate as a risk management tool to monitor securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or other risk factors. Securities under ESM face additional trading restrictions and surveillance to protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and investors must be aware of securities under ESM framework
- Securities in ESM may be subject to: Trade-to-Trade (T2T) settlement, additional margins, price bands, or other restrictions
- Market participants should exercise enhanced due diligence when trading ESM securities
- Continuous monitoring of securities already in ESM framework is mandatory

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 19, 2025 - All ESM framework changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Securities newly added to ESM or moved to higher stages may experience reduced liquidity due to additional trading restrictions. The framework aims to curb excessive speculation and protect retail investors from abnormal price volatility.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these securities should be aware of potential additional margin requirements and T2T settlement obligations. Enhanced surveillance may lead to improved price discovery and reduced manipulation risks over time.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new ESM classifications and ensure compliance with applicable restrictions for each security and stage.
