## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The revision affects trading dynamics across six securities with varying degrees of restriction. Piramal Finance gains increased trading flexibility with a 20% band, potentially allowing for greater price discovery. Conversely, Synthiko Foils faces the most restrictive 2% band, indicating heightened surveillance concerns and limited intraday volatility.

**Trading Impact:** Market participants must adjust their trading strategies, particularly for Synthiko Foils where the tight 2% band significantly limits intraday price movements. The diverse range of bands (2% to 20%) suggests individualized surveillance assessments based on each scrip's specific circumstances.

**Investor Impact:** Investors in these scrips should be aware of the modified price movement limits. Tighter bands may reduce liquidity and impact order execution, while wider bands allow for greater price flexibility but potentially higher volatility.
