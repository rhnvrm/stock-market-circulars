title: Further Extension of Timeline for Mandatory Implementation of Systems and Processes
  by Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs) for T+0 Settlement Cycle
---

## Summary

SEBI has further extended the timeline for Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs) to implement necessary systems and processes for enabling seamless investor participation in the optional T+0 settlement cycle. The previous deadline of November 01, 2025 has been postponed, with further guidance on the new timeline to be intimated at a later date. This extension follows challenges highlighted by QSBs in ensuring timely readiness of their systems.

## Key Points

- Timeline for QSBs to implement T+0 settlement systems extended beyond November 01, 2025
- New deadline to be communicated through further guidance at a later date
- Extension granted due to challenges faced by QSBs in ensuring system readiness
- Applies to QSBs designated as such and meeting minimum active client parameters as of December 31, 2024
- All other provisions of the original SEBI Circular dated December 10, 2024 remain unchanged
- Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs) must take necessary implementation steps and amend relevant byelaws

## Regulatory Changes

This circular modifies the implementation timeline specified in:
- SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-3/P/CIR/2024/172 dated December 10, 2024 (original circular introducing enhanced scope of optional T+0 settlement)
- SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-3/P/CIR/2025/58 dated April 29, 2025 (first extension to November 01, 2025)

The timeline extension applies specifically to paragraphs 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 of the December 10, 2024 circular regarding QSB obligations.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs):**
- Must put in place necessary systems and processes for enabling seamless investor participation in optional T+0 settlement cycle
- Timeline extended; new deadline to be announced later
- Applies to QSBs meeting minimum active client parameters as of December 31, 2024

**For Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs):**
- Take necessary steps and implement required systems
- Make amendments to relevant byelaws, rules, and regulations
- Notify market participants and investors
- Disseminate circular provisions on their websites

## Important Dates

- **December 10, 2024**: Original SEBI circular introducing enhanced T+0 settlement scope
- **December 31, 2024**: Reference date for determining QSB qualification based on minimum active clients
- **April 29, 2025**: First timeline extension granted (to November 01, 2025)
- **October 30, 2025**: Current circular issued providing further extension
- **November 01, 2025**: Previous deadline (now extended)
- **To be announced**: New implementation deadline for QSB systems

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Delays full-scale implementation of optional T+0 settlement infrastructure across qualified brokers
- Provides additional time for industry to ensure robust system readiness
- May temporarily limit investor access to T+0 settlement facilities through certain QSBs

**Operational Impact:**
- QSBs gain additional time to address technical and operational challenges
- Reduces risk of system failures or inadequate infrastructure at implementation
- Stock exchanges, clearing corporations, and depositories must continue coordination efforts

**Investor Impact:**
- Potential delay in widespread availability of T+0 settlement option
- Ensures better quality of service when systems are eventually implemented
- Protects investors from potential issues arising from premature system deployment
