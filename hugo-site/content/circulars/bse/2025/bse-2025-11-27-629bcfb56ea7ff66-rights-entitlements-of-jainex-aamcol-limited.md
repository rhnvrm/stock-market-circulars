## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to shareholders of JAINEX AAMCOL LIMITED holding Rights Entitlements. The short 4-day renunciation trading window provides liquidity for shareholders who do not wish to participate in the rights issue.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure proper client communication and compliance with disclaimer requirements in contract notes. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis requires careful operational management.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders must act within the specified timeframe to either subscribe to the rights issue, renounce their entitlements through trading, or risk having their REs lapse and become worthless after December 09, 2025.
