## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects specific shareholders and brokers with pending delivery obligations across 69 scrips. While the number of scrips is significant, many have small quantities (single digit shares).

**Operational Impact:** The auction resolves delivery failures and ensures settlement completion. Notable volumes in scrips like Avance Technologies (119,138 shares) and Mega Corporation (10,000 shares) may see price volatility during auction. Smaller quantities in blue-chip stocks like Infosys (9 shares), Tech Mahindra (1 share), and Biocon (405 shares) indicate isolated delivery issues rather than systemic problems.
