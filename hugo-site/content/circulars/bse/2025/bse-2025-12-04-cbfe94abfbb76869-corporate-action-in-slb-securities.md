## Impact Assessment

This circular impacts participants in the SLB segment who have borrowed or lent shares of the affected companies. The foreclosure mechanism ensures that rights entitlements are properly allocated to eligible shareholders. Traders must plan to close or roll over their SLB positions before the foreclosure dates to avoid forced settlement. The shut periods prevent new SLB transactions that could complicate rights issue entitlement calculations.
