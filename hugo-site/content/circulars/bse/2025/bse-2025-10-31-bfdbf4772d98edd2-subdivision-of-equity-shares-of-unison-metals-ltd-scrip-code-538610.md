## Key Points

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that the existing ISIN INE099D01018 will not be valid for transactions executed on or after November 28, 2025
- Market participants must await communication of the new ISIN number for Re.1/- paid up shares before trading post-subdivision
- Depository participants and shareholders need to ensure their records are updated post-subdivision

## Important Dates

- **October 31, 2025**: Circular issued by BSE
- **November 28, 2025**: Record date for share subdivision
- **November 28, 2025**: Effective date - old ISIN becomes invalid, new subdivided shares become effective

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Share subdivisions typically improve liquidity by reducing the per-share price, making the stock more accessible to retail investors. The 1:10 split will reduce the trading price to one-tenth of the current level.

**Shareholder Impact**: Neutral to Positive - Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held, maintaining their proportional ownership. The total value of holdings remains unchanged, but increased liquidity may benefit shareholders.

**Trading Impact**: Operational changes required for the ISIN transition. Trading members must ensure systems are updated to handle the new ISIN and face value from the effective date. A brief period of adjustment may occur as the market adapts to the new share structure.
