## Summary

BSE has announced the delisting of 60 debt scrip codes from various companies effective December 17, 2025. These securities were previously suspended from trading due to maturity and/or record dates fixed for redemption/delisting. The delisting covers debt instruments from major corporate issuers including infrastructure companies, financial institutions, NBFCs, and industrial corporations.

## Key Points

- 60 debt scrip codes across multiple companies to be delisted from BSE
- Effective date: December 17, 2025
- All affected securities were already under suspension due to maturity or redemption
- Notice applies to Debt segment only
- Covers diverse sectors: financial services, infrastructure, manufacturing, and real estate
- Major issuers include JSW Steel, Indian Oil Corporation, ICICI Securities, Mahindra Lifespace, Shree Cement, and others
- Includes both corporate bonds and structured debt instruments (trusts and securitization vehicles)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard administrative action following the maturity or redemption of debt securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must take note of the delisting
- No trading will be permitted in these scrip codes from December 17, 2025
- Members should update their systems to reflect the delisting status
- Investors holding these securities should have already received redemption proceeds as per the original terms

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 16, 2025
- **Delisting Effective Date**: December 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. The delisting is a routine administrative action for securities that have already completed their lifecycle. Since all securities were already suspended from trading, there is no impact on active trading activity.

**Investor Impact**: Affected investors should have already received their principal and interest payments as per the redemption/maturity terms. No action required from investors as these are post-maturity delistings.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and records to reflect the delisted status. Back-office systems should be adjusted to prevent any inadvertent trading attempts in these scrip codes.

**Sectors Affected**: Financial services (NBFCs, housing finance), infrastructure (airports, expressways, metro rail), manufacturing (steel, cement), real estate developers, and structured finance vehicles (trusts and securitization entities).
