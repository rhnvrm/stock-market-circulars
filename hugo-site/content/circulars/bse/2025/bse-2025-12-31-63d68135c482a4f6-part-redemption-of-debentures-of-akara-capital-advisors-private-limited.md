## Impact Assessment

This corporate action has minimal market-wide impact as it affects only holders of specific private placement debentures issued by AKARA CAPITAL ADVISORS PRIVATE LIMITED. The part redemption reduces the outstanding face value of the debentures, returning capital to debenture holders while maintaining the securities in circulation at reduced denominations. Trading members dealing with these specific securities need to update their systems to reflect the new face values.
