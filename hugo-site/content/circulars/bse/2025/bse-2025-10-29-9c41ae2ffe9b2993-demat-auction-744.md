## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine settlement auction process that occurs regularly on the exchange.

**Affected Parties:** 
- Sellers who failed to deliver securities in the specified settlement
- Buyers awaiting delivery of these securities
- Clearing members handling these transactions

**Operational Impact:** Standard auction process will be conducted to ensure delivery of securities where sellers have defaulted. The quantities involved represent a small fraction of overall market volumes for most scrips listed.

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal - While some high-value stocks like HDFC Bank show significant quantities (41,800 shares), these represent normal auction settlement volumes and should not materially impact market liquidity.
