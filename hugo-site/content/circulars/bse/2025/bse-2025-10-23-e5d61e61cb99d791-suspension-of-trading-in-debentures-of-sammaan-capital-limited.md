## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the specified debentures from October 27, 2025
- All exchange participants must note the suspension and comply with the no-dealings instruction
- Corporate action reference DR-743/2025-2026 should be tracked for updates

## Important Dates

- **October 23, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 27, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **October 27, 2025**: Trading suspension effective (no dealings from this date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The suspension affects multiple debenture series but is limited to SAMMAAN CAPITAL LIMITED's debt instruments. NCD holders expecting redemption and interest payment are directly impacted.

**Investor Impact:** High for holders of these specific NCDs - they cannot exit positions through secondary market trading from October 27, 2025 onwards. However, this is standard procedure for corporate actions involving redemption.

**Trading Impact:** Trading liquidity in these six debenture series will cease from the specified date. The suspension appears related to normal corporate action processing for maturity/redemption rather than regulatory concerns.
