## Impact Assessment

This corporate action impacts holders of MANBA FINANCE LIMITED's 11.75% debentures maturing on June 26, 2026. The part redemption will return capital to debenture holders while reducing the outstanding principal amount. Post-redemption, the debentures will trade at the reduced face value of Rs. 33,328. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face value for accurate pricing and settlement. This is a standard corporate action with limited broader market impact, affecting only specific debenture holders.
