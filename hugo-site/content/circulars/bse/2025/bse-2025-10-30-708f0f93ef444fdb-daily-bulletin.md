## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to medium. This is a routine daily bulletin affecting specific securities rather than broad market operations. However, dividend announcements may influence trading activity in affected stocks.

**Investor Impact:** Medium. Shareholders of dividend-declaring companies and holders of commercial paper/debentures need to be aware of record dates to ensure eligibility for payments. Notable dividends include Dabur India's Rs.2.75 per share interim dividend.

**Operational Impact:** Low. Standard corporate action processing by exchanges, depositories, and registrars. One revision noted for HDFC Securities CP redemption date (November 10, 2025).

**Trading Impact:** Minimal. Trading flag 1 indicates normal trading continues on record dates with settlement adjustments for corporate actions.
