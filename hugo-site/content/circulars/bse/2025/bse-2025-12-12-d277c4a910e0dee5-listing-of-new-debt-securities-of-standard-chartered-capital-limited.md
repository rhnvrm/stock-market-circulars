## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine private placement listing with limited market-wide impact. The securities are relevant only to institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals participating in the debt market.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for debt investors seeking AAA-rated securities with moderate returns. The 7.3% annual interest rate provides competitive fixed income in the current interest rate environment.

**Liquidity Impact**: Low to moderate liquidity expected given the private placement nature and market lot of 1 unit with Rs. 1 lakh face value, restricting participation to institutional and high-net-worth investors.

**Credit Quality**: Highest safety with dual AAA ratings from CRISIL and ICRA, indicating strong creditworthiness of Standard Chartered Capital Limited and minimal default risk.
