## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing of 149,995 shares represents a relatively small addition to the existing equity base. With differential lock-in periods (until June 2026 and June 2027), immediate tradable float impact is further limited.

**Operational Impact**: Routine corporate action. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and distinctive number ranges.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution from preferential allotment. The lock-in provisions provide stability by restricting immediate sale of allotted shares.
