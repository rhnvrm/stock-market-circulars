## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a routine listing notification for employee stock option exercise.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities available for trading
- Standard trading and settlement procedures apply from the effective date
- No special compliance requirements for these listings

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 2, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date**: December 3, 2025
- **Lock-in Period**: None (NA for all companies)

## Impact Assessment

The market impact is expected to be minimal as these are routine ESOP/ESOS share listings with relatively small quantities compared to the companies' total market capitalization. The absence of lock-in periods means shares are immediately tradeable, but the volumes are not significant enough to materially affect stock prices. This is a standard corporate action reflecting employee compensation programs.
