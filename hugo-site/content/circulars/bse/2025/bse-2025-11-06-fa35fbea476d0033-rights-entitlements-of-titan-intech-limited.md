## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium impact limited to TITAN INTECH LIMITED shareholders and market participants interested in the company's rights issue. The trading window for REs is brief (5 days) requiring prompt action from eligible shareholders who wish to renounce their rights. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis ensures transparency but requires careful attention to timelines. Unrenounced and unsubscribed REs will permanently lapse after the issue closing date, making timely decision-making critical for rights holders.
