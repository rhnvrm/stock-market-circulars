title: Removal of restriction on subscription in certain schemes of Aditya Birla Sun
  Life Mutual Fund
---

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited has announced the removal of the maximum subscription limit of Rs. 10 crores per PAN per investor across all transactions in two of its schemes: Aditya Birla Sun Life Medium Term Plan and Aditya Birla Sun Life Credit Risk Fund. This change takes effect from December 8, 2025, as per Addendum No. 53/2025 to the Scheme Information Document and Key Information Memorandum.

## Key Points

- Maximum subscription restriction of Rs. 10 crores per PAN removed
- Applies to Aditya Birla Sun Life Medium Term Plan
- Applies to Aditya Birla Sun Life Credit Risk Fund
- All other scheme features and terms remain unchanged
- Addendum forms integral part of SID and KIM

## Regulatory Changes

The investment restriction that previously capped subscriptions at Rs. 10 crores per PAN per investor across all transactions has been completely removed for the specified schemes. This represents a liberalization of investment limits, allowing investors to subscribe to larger amounts without PAN-based restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance actions are required from investors. The change is administrative in nature and expands investment opportunities. Investors should:

- Review updated SID and KIM documents incorporating this addendum
- Continue to read all scheme-related documents carefully before investing
- Note that mutual fund investments remain subject to market risks

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 4, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 8, 2025 (Monday)

## Impact Assessment

This change has medium impact for investors seeking to make larger investments in these schemes. The removal of the Rs. 10 crore cap particularly benefits high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors who can now allocate larger amounts to these debt-oriented schemes. For the Medium Term Plan and Credit Risk Fund, this could potentially increase assets under management and provide greater liquidity. The change indicates the fund house's confidence in managing larger inflows in these schemes while maintaining portfolio quality and risk management standards.
