- No dealings permitted from November 14, 2025
- Suspension relates to both redemption of debentures and interest payment
- Notice reference: DR-756/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must refrain from executing any trades in the specified ABANS FINANCE PRIVATE LIMITED debentures from November 14, 2025
- Trading members must ensure their systems reflect the suspension to prevent inadvertent trading

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - affects only a single private placement debenture issue with limited trading activity.

**Investor Impact**: Medium for NCD holders - existing holders should be aware of the upcoming redemption and final interest payment. The suspension is temporary and routine for such corporate actions.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - standard procedure for trading members to implement suspension ahead of record dates. No systemic implications for broader debt market operations.
