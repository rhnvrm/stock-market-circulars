## Impact Assessment

This part redemption reduces the outstanding face value of each debenture by 50%, from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 50,000. Debenture holders will receive payment for the redeemed portion along with accrued interest. The remaining debentures will continue to trade until the final maturity date of December 2, 2026. This action provides liquidity to debenture holders while allowing the company to reduce its debt obligations. Trading members must update their systems to reflect the reduced face value to ensure accurate trading and settlement.
