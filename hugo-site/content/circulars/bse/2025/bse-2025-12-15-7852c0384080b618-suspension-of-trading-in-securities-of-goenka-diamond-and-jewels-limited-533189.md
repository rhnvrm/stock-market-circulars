title: Suspension of Trading in Securities of Goenka Diamond and Jewels Limited (533189)
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in equity shares of Goenka Diamond and Jewels Limited (Scrip Code: 533189) effective December 16, 2025. This action follows the admission of the company into liquidation by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Jaipur Bench, through its order dated December 02, 2025. While the Hon'ble National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), Delhi granted a stay on the appointment of the liquidator on December 09, 2025, the trading suspension remains in effect based on the initiation of liquidation proceedings.

## Key Points

- NCLT Jaipur Bench admitted Goenka Diamond and Jewels Limited into liquidation on December 02, 2025
- NCLAT Delhi granted a stay on the appointment of liquidator on December 09, 2025
- Trading suspension is based on the initiation of liquidation proceedings, not the liquidator appointment
- Suspension affects equity shares only (Scrip Code: 533189)
- Trading members are advised to take note of the suspension

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This suspension is implemented under existing BSE regulations governing securities of companies undergoing liquidation proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all trading activities in Goenka Diamond and Jewels Limited equity shares from December 16, 2025
- Trading members should update their systems and communicate the suspension to clients holding or interested in the scrip
- All pending orders for the scrip should be cancelled or suspended

## Important Dates

- **December 02, 2025**: NCLT Jaipur Bench order admitting company into liquidation
- **December 09, 2025**: NCLAT Delhi order granting stay on liquidator appointment
- **December 15, 2025**: BSE circular notification date
- **December 16, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Shareholders of Goenka Diamond and Jewels Limited will be unable to trade their holdings on BSE from December 16, 2025. This creates a complete liquidity freeze for equity holders, preventing any exit or entry opportunities through the exchange.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders face significant uncertainty regarding the recovery of their investments, which will now depend on the outcome of liquidation proceedings. The stay on liquidator appointment adds complexity to the timeline and outcome.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure compliance with the suspension, update client communications, and manage any client positions or inquiries related to this scrip. The unusual situation of liquidation proceedings being initiated while the liquidator appointment is stayed may create additional confusion requiring clarification to clients.
