title: Non-Business Day for Certain Mutual Fund Schemes on BSE StAR MF Platform -
  December 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular announcing non-business days for certain mutual fund schemes on the BSE StAR MF Platform during December 2025. The circular affects fund of funds and offshore schemes from six asset management companies: AXIS, Franklin, Kotak, Edelweiss, DSP, and Invesco. The non-business days primarily coincide with Christmas holidays (December 24-26) and year-end holidays (December 31), reflecting international market closures that impact these offshore and international investment schemes.

## Key Points

- AXIS Mutual Fund: December 24, 25, 26 for Greater China, Global Equity Alpha, Global Innovation, NASDAQ 100, and US Treasury Dynamic Bond schemes
- Franklin Mutual Fund: December 25-26 for US Opportunities and Templeton European Opportunities schemes
- Kotak Mutual Fund: December 24-26 for US Specific Equity, International REIT, and Global Emerging Market schemes
- Edelweiss Mutual Fund: December 24, 26, 31 for all offshore schemes; December 25 for all schemes
- DSP Mutual Fund: December 24-26, 29 for various global and natural resources schemes; December 25 all schemes closed
- Invesco Mutual Fund: December 24, 26, 31 for NASDAQ-100, Global Consumer Trends, Global Equity Income, and Pan European schemes

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational notification regarding holiday schedules.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors will not be able to place purchase, redemption, or switch transactions for affected schemes on specified non-business days
- AMCs must ensure proper communication to distributors and investors about these non-business days
- BSE StAR MF platform will not process transactions for these schemes on the specified dates

## Important Dates

- **December 24, 2025**: Non-business day for AXIS, Kotak, Edelweiss, DSP, and Invesco offshore schemes
- **December 25, 2025**: Non-business day for all mentioned AMCs (DSP all schemes closed)
- **December 26, 2025**: Non-business day for AXIS, Franklin, Kotak, Edelweiss, DSP, and Invesco offshore schemes
- **December 29, 2025**: Non-business day for DSP Value Fund only
- **December 31, 2025**: Non-business day for Edelweiss and Invesco offshore schemes

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The non-business days affect only fund of funds and offshore schemes that invest in international markets, which naturally follow the holiday schedules of their underlying markets.

**Investor Impact**: Low. Investors planning transactions in these specific schemes during the Christmas and New Year period should plan accordingly. Domestic equity and debt schemes are not affected.

**Operational Impact**: Routine. This is standard practice for schemes investing in international markets that observe different holiday calendars. The notification ensures transparency and helps investors plan their transactions appropriately.
