## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects two securities under the SLB scheme with different corporate actions. The right issue may lead to increased trading activity in Deccan Gold Mines shares, while the buyback could affect eClerx's share price and liquidity.

**Operational Impact:** Investors holding these securities or having positions in the SLB scheme must ensure they understand eligibility criteria based on record dates. Brokers and custodians need to process corporate action entitlements accurately. The shut periods will temporarily restrict SLB activities for these securities, requiring participants to plan their lending/borrowing strategies accordingly.
