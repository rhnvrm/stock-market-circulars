**Market Impact**: Medium - New technology company listing adds to BSE's IT sector offerings. The substantial number of locked-in shares (approximately 8.22 crore shares under various lock-in periods) will limit immediate free float.

**Liquidity Impact**: The lock-in structure ensures controlled supply of shares in the market over different time periods. ESOP and IPO public shares (approximately 3.28 crore shares) are immediately tradable, providing initial liquidity.

**Investor Impact**: Investors should note the lock-in schedules when assessing available float. The staggered lock-in expiry dates (1 month, 3 months, 1 year, and 3 years) will gradually increase tradable supply.

**Company Profile**: Excelsoft Technologies Limited is an education technology company with offices in Mysuru, Noida, and Hyderabad, operating in the software development sector (CIN indicates software publishing activities).
