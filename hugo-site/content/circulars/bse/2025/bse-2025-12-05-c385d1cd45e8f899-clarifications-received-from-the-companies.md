## Summary

BSE received clarifications from three listed companies - Vijaya Diagnostic Centre Limited (Scrip Code: 543350), Banco Products (India) Limited, and Laxmi Dental Limited (Scrip Code: 544339) - in response to surveillance inquiries about increased trading volumes in their securities. All three companies confirmed they have made all necessary disclosures under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, have not withheld any material price-sensitive information, and believe the volume increases are purely market-driven.

## Key Points

- Vijaya Diagnostic Centre Limited responded to BSE surveillance query (Ref: L/SURV/ONL/PV/APJ/2025-2026/739) on December 05, 2025
- Banco Products (India) Limited responded to BSE surveillance query (Ref: L/SURV/ONL/PV/APJ/2025-2026/736) on December 05, 2025
- Laxmi Dental Limited responded to queries from both NSE (December 04, 2025) and BSE (December 05, 2025)
- All companies confirmed full compliance with Regulation 30 of SEBI LODR 2015
- All companies stated no undisclosed material information or impending announcements that could impact price/volume
- Volume increases attributed to normal market activity without management involvement

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This circular documents standard surveillance monitoring and company responses.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must respond promptly to stock exchange surveillance queries regarding unusual price or volume movements
- Companies must confirm whether all material disclosures have been made under SEBI LODR Regulations
- Companies must clarify if they possess any undisclosed information that could explain market movements

## Important Dates

- December 04, 2025: NSE sent surveillance query to Laxmi Dental Limited (6:12 PM)
- December 05, 2025: BSE sent surveillance queries to all three companies
- December 05, 2025: All three companies submitted their clarifications to BSE

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is routine surveillance activity where exchanges monitor unusual trading patterns and seek explanations from companies. The clarifications confirm no undisclosed material developments at any of the three companies. The volume increases appear to be normal market activity rather than information-driven trading. Investors can be assured that all material information about these companies has been properly disclosed.
