Minimal market impact. This is a routine preferential allotment listing for a relatively small number of shares (19 lakh shares) with a one-year lock-in period ending May 30, 2026. The shares are subject to lock-in restrictions, limiting immediate trading impact. The conversion of warrants to equity shares is a standard corporate action.
