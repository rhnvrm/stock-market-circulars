title: New ISIN Number for WEBSOL ENERGY SYSTEM LTD Following Share Sub-Division
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a new ISIN number for WEBSOL ENERGY SYSTEM LTD (Scrip Code: 517498) following the sub-division of equity shares. The new ISIN INE855C01023 will be effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of November 14, 2025. This is a continuation of the exchange notice dated November 4, 2025, and reflects the company's share subdivision from face value Rs.10/- to Re.1/-.

## Key Points

- New ISIN number assigned: INE855C01023
- Company: WEBSOL ENERGY SYSTEM LTD
- Scrip Code: 517498
- Corporate action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Re.1/-
- New face value: Re.1/- per equity share
- Effective date: November 14, 2025 (ex-date)
- Reference: DR-756/2025-2026
- Continuation of exchange notice dated November 4, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard administrative update reflecting a corporate action. The new ISIN replaces the old ISIN for the subdivided shares, maintaining proper identification in the trading and settlement system.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN number INE855C01023 for all trades in WEBSOL ENERGY SYSTEM LTD equity shares executed on or after November 14, 2025
- Members should update their systems and records to reflect the new ISIN and the revised face value of Re.1/- per share
- All post-subdivision trades must reference the new ISIN for proper settlement

## Important Dates

- **November 4, 2025**: Original exchange notice issued
- **November 12, 2025**: Circular date announcing new ISIN
- **November 14, 2025**: Ex-date - new ISIN becomes effective for trading

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. This is a routine corporate action that increases the number of shares outstanding while proportionally reducing the share price. The subdivision from Rs.10/- to Re.1/- represents a 10:1 split, which typically improves liquidity and accessibility for retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Medium for trading members and market infrastructure. Systems must be updated to recognize the new ISIN, and care must be taken to ensure trades executed on or after the ex-date use the correct identifier. No impact on shareholder value as this is a proportional adjustment.

**Trading Continuity**: Normal trading continues with the new ISIN from the ex-date. The subdivision may result in increased trading volumes due to lower absolute share prices making the stock more accessible to smaller investors.
