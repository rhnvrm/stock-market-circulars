## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market impact as it represents a routine commercial paper issuance by Adani Enterprises for short-term funding needs. The instrument is privately placed and limited to institutional investors. With strong credit ratings (A1+) and a short tenor of 5 months, this represents standard treasury operations. Trading members can contact BSE debt department (phone: 22728352/8597/8995/5753/8915) for clarifications. The discount pricing suggests an implicit yield of approximately 3% for the 5-month period.
