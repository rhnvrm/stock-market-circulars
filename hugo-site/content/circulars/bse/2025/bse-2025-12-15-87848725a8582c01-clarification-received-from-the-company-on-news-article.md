---

## Summary

InterGlobe Aviation Limited (IndiGo) has issued a clarification in response to a news article published on Moneycontrol on December 11, 2025, which claimed that SEBI was examining whether IndiGo's parent company failed in disclosures and that the board's role was under scrutiny. The company has confirmed that it has not received any communication from SEBI indicating that any assessment or examination has been commenced, making the information in the news article factually incorrect. The company has been responding to routine queries from stock exchanges NSE and BSE regarding ongoing LODR Regulations compliance obligations.

## Key Points

- Company states it is not aware of any undisclosed information that could explain price movement
- Clarification provided pursuant to Regulation 30(10) of LODR Regulations

- **December 11, 2025**: NSE and BSE letters seeking clarification received by company
- **December 12, 2025**: Company's clarification letter issued

## Impact Assessment

The clarification addresses market speculation and potential investor concerns arising from the media report about SEBI examination. While the company denies any SEBI investigation has commenced, the need for public clarification indicates market sensitivity to the news. The company's confirmation that it has been responding to routine stock exchange queries suggests normal regulatory oversight rather than any specific enforcement action. This clarification should help stabilize investor sentiment by dispelling rumors of regulatory scrutiny, though it acknowledges ongoing routine compliance interactions with stock exchanges. The impact is moderate as it relates to corporate governance perceptions and investor confidence in one of India's leading aviation companies.
