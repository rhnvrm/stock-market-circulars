## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it relates to the listing of privately placed debt securities of a single company. The impact is limited to:

- **Investors**: Provides liquidity option for holders of these privately placed debentures
- **Trading Members**: Informational notice for potential trading in these securities
- **Issuer**: Enhances marketability of debt securities through BSE listing

The BB+ credit rating indicates below investment-grade quality, and the 20% interest rate reflects the higher risk profile. This is a routine listing with no broader market implications.
