---

## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that eight specific scrips will not be available for trading in the T+0 (same-day) rolling settlement cycle on two dates: Monday, December 22, 2025, and Friday, December 26, 2025. Four scrips are affected on each date, including major names like IndiGo, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, Canara Bank, and Punjab National Bank.

## Key Points

- Eight scrips will be unavailable for T+0 trading on specified dates
- December 22, 2025: INDIGO, TMPV, MAXHEALTH, INDUSINDBK not available for T+0
- December 26, 2025: CANBK, AUBANK, PNB, UNIONBANK not available for T+0
- Regular T+1 and T+2 settlement cycles remain unaffected
- Notice applies to equity segment trading

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a temporary operational measure for specific dates.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure these scrips are not offered for T+0 settlement on the specified dates
- Members should update their trading systems to reflect these restrictions
- Client communication recommended for active T+0 traders in these securities

## Important Dates

- **December 22, 2025 (Monday)**: INDIGO, TMPV, MAXHEALTH, INDUSINDBK unavailable for T+0
- **December 26, 2025 (Friday)**: CANBK, AUBANK, PNB, UNIONBANK unavailable for T+0
- **Notice Date**: November 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited - affects only T+0 (intraday settlement) trading for specific scrips on two dates. Regular T+1 settlement remains available, so overall market liquidity should not be significantly impacted.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and brokers offering T+0 settlement services will need to temporarily exclude these scrips from their intraday settlement offerings. System updates may be required to enforce these restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors seeking same-day settlement for these scrips on the specified dates will need to use standard T+1 settlement. This primarily affects intraday traders and those requiring immediate settlement.
