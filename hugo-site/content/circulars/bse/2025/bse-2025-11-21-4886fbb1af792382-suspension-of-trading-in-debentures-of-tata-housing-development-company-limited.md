## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and traders of these two specific debentures of TATA HOUSING DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LIMITED.

Investors holding these debentures as of the record date will receive their redemption proceeds and interest payment. The suspension prevents trading during the redemption process to maintain clarity on beneficial ownership for payment purposes.
