## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Limited to ECLERX shareholders and participants in the buyback process.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Members and custodians must coordinate early pay-in of demat shares through depository systems with strict timeline adherence to ensure bid acceptance. The automatic earmarking/blocking of securities in client accounts streamlines the process but requires advance planning to meet BSE OTB platform deadlines.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders of ECLERX SERVICES LTD wishing to participate in the buyback must ensure their demat shares are delivered through their members/custodians within the specified timeline.
