title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Securities Moving to GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of three securities into their respective Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages effective from the circular date. One security is moving to GSM Stage I, while two securities are moving to GSM Stage III. The GSM framework is designed to alert investors about securities that have witnessed abnormal price rise and alert them to be extra cautious while dealing in such securities.

## Key Points

- Shashwat Furnishing Solutions Limited (Security Code: 543519, ISIN: INE0JMN01019) moved to GSM Stage I
- Oswal Yarns Ltd. (Security Code: 514460, ISIN: INE670H01017) moved to GSM Stage III
- Sunraj Diamond Exports Ltd. (Security Code: 523425, ISIN: INE459D01014) moved to GSM Stage III
- Securities marked with (#) may move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- Securities marked with ($) may move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in IBC Framework

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework applies graded surveillance measures with increasing levels of restrictions as securities move through different stages. Stage III involves more stringent surveillance measures compared to Stage I, including potential restrictions on trading parameters.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants and investors should be aware of the GSM stage applicable to these securities
- Enhanced caution is advised while trading in these securities
- Investors should review the GSM framework guidelines for understanding the restrictions applicable at each stage
- Trading members must ensure compliance with additional surveillance requirements for these securities

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: December 19, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The movement of securities to higher GSM stages indicates that these stocks have exhibited unusual price movements or volatility. Stage III classification for Oswal Yarns and Sunraj Diamond Exports suggests heightened surveillance and potentially stricter trading conditions. Investors should exercise increased caution and conduct thorough due diligence before trading in these securities. The GSM framework aims to protect investor interests by providing early warning signals about securities with abnormal market behavior.
