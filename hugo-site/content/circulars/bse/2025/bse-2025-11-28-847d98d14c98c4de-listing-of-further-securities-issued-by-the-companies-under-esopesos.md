## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. ESOP/ESOS listings are routine corporate actions that typically have negligible impact on stock prices as the share quantities are relatively small compared to existing outstanding shares.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in floating stock for the 13 companies. The largest addition is Hexaware Technologies with 2 million shares and RBL Bank with 2.87 million shares.

**Shareholder Dilution**: Minor dilution effect as these shares represent employee compensation and are expected issuances under approved schemes.

**Trading Consideration**: No lock-in restrictions mean these shares are immediately tradable, but employee holders typically retain shares or sell gradually rather than creating sudden supply shocks.
