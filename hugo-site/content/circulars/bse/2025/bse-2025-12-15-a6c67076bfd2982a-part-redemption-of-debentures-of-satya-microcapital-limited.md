Debenture holders will receive both interest payments and partial redemption proceeds on the record dates. The reduced face values will be reflected in trading from the effective dates, impacting the pricing and settlement of these securities. This is a routine corporate action in the debt securities market and demonstrates the company's adherence to its debt repayment schedule.
