Low impact circular. This is a routine listing notification for debt market participants. The listing of commercial paper securities provides short-term financing for 360 ONE Prime Limited and offers investment opportunities for debt market participants. The high credit ratings (A1+ from both CRISIL and ICRA) indicate strong creditworthiness. Impact is limited to debt segment traders and investors interested in short-term money market instruments.
