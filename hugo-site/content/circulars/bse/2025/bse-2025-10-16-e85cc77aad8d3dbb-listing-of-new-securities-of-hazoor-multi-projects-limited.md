## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine listing of preferential allotment shares for a single company. The modest size of the allotment (42.12 lakh shares) and lock-in restrictions limit immediate trading impact.

**Liquidity Impact**: Neutral in short term due to lock-in until April 2026. Post lock-in expiry, there will be potential supply of 42.12 lakh shares in the market.

**Dilution Impact**: The preferential allotment to non-promoters will dilute existing shareholding, though the actual dilution percentage depends on the company's pre-issue equity base.

**Operational Impact**: None for trading members beyond noting the additional shares in circulation for the scrip code 532467.
