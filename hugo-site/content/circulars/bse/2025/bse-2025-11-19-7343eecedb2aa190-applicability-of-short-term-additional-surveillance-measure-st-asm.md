## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective November 20, 2025. The circular identifies 10 securities being newly added to the ST-ASM framework, 9 securities moving out of the framework, and provides a consolidated list of all securities currently under ST-ASM surveillance. Securities under this measure face enhanced surveillance and trading restrictions based on price volatility and other risk parameters.

## Key Points

- 10 securities are being newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework from November 20, 2025
- 9 securities are moving out of ST-ASM Framework, with some transitioning to other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge, ESM)
- No securities are moving to higher or lower stages within the ST-ASM framework
- The framework includes both regular securities and SME scrips (marked with @)
- T+0 scrips are shortlisted based on their parent company status (marked with ~)
- Consolidated list shows securities classified under Stage I of Short Term ASM

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies short-term surveillance measures (5/15/30 days) to securities exhibiting unusual price movements or trading patterns. Securities under this framework are subject to:

- Enhanced monitoring by the exchange
- Potential trading restrictions including higher margins
- Periodic review for continuation, upgrade, or removal from the framework

Securities may move between different surveillance frameworks (ST-ASM, LT-ASM, GSM, ESM, Trade for Trade, Pledge Framework) based on their risk profile and compliance status.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants trading in securities under ST-ASM framework must comply with enhanced surveillance requirements

- Listed companies under ST-ASM should monitor their inclusion status and work towards compliance to exit the framework
- Brokers and trading members must ensure systems are updated to reflect the revised ST-ASM list

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 20, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework take effect
- **Circular Date**: November 19, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The changes affect 19 securities with 10 entering and 9 exiting the ST-ASM framework. While this represents a small subset of the overall market, affected securities will experience changes in trading conditions.

**Trading Impact**: Securities entering ST-ASM may face reduced liquidity due to enhanced surveillance and potential margin increases. Investors in these stocks should expect higher volatility monitoring and possible trading restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Holders of affected securities should review their positions, especially for the 10 newly added stocks. Enhanced surveillance typically signals exchange concerns about price movements or trading patterns.

**Transition Impact**: Securities moving from ST-ASM to other frameworks (particularly LT-ASM) face continued surveillance but under different parameters, which may result in different trading conditions and margin requirements.
