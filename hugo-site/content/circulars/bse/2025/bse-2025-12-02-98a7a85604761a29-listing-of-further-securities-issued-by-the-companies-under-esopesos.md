## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to update their systems to reflect the new shares available for trading
- Companies must ensure compliance with existing ESOP/ESOS listing requirements
- Standard trading and settlement procedures apply from the listing date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 2, 2025
- **Listing and Trading Commencement**: December 3, 2025 (Wednesday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not Applicable (NA) - No lock-in restrictions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The quantities being listed represent employee compensation shares and are relatively small compared to the outstanding share capital of the respective companies. The lack of lock-in restrictions means shares can be traded immediately, but given the small volumes, significant price impact is unlikely.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in floating stock for each company. The largest addition is 209,236 shares for Aditya Birla Lifestyle Brands.

**Dilution Impact**: Minor dilution effect for existing shareholders as these shares were already accounted for in the fully diluted share capital.

1. Aditya Birla Lifestyle Brands Limited (544403) - 209,236 shares
2. Arvind Fashions Limited (542484) - 21,000 shares
