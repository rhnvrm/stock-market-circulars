## Impact Assessment

The market impact is minimal as ESOP share listings are routine corporate actions. The combined issuance represents a small fraction of the outstanding shares for these companies. For most companies, the ESOP shares constitute less than 0.1% dilution. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares are immediately available for trading, though employee shareholders typically hold such shares for longer periods. This reflects healthy employee participation in equity compensation programs across diverse sectors of the Indian economy.
