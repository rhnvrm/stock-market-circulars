## Summary

BSE announces mandatory adjustments to all Futures and Options contracts for HDFC Bank Ltd (scrip code 500180) following the company's 1:1 bonus issue announcement. The adjustments will be implemented on August 25, 2025, with ex-date of August 26, 2025.

## Key Points

- HDFC Bank declared 1:1 bonus issue (1 bonus share for every 1 existing share)
- Record date: August 27, 2025
- Adjustment factor: 2.0 [(1+1)/1]
- All F&O contracts on HDFC Bank (derivatives asset code: HDBK) will be adjusted
- Adjustments effective end of day August 25, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Adjustments implemented in compliance with SEBI guidelines for F&O contract modifications due to corporate actions:

1. **Strike Price**: Divided by adjustment factor (2)
2. **Market Lot**: Multiplied by adjustment factor (2) - from 550 to 1,100 shares
3. **Position Size**: Multiplied by adjustment factor (2)
4. **Futures Price**: Divided by adjustment factor (2), rounded to nearest tick size

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must account for adjusted contract specifications
- All existing positions will be automatically adjusted by the exchange
- Members should contact designated Relationship Managers for clarifications

## Important Dates

- **August 25, 2025**: Contract adjustments implemented (end of day)
- **August 26, 2025**: Ex-date for bonus issue
- **August 27, 2025**: Record date for bonus entitlement

## Impact Assessment

High impact on derivatives market participants holding HDFC Bank F&O positions. The 2x adjustment factor significantly changes contract specifications, requiring traders to recalibrate strategies and risk management parameters. Market lot doubling from 550 to 1,100 shares increases minimum transaction value.
