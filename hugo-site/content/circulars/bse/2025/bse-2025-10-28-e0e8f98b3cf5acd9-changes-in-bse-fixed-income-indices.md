## Compliance Requirements

- Index fund managers tracking BSE India 10 Year Sovereign Bond Index should rebalance portfolios to reflect the new constituent
- Portfolio adjustments should be completed by the effective date of October 31, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This change will primarily impact institutional investors, index fund managers, and passive investment products tracking the BSE India 10 Year Sovereign Bond Index. The substitution maintains the 10-year benchmark profile while updating to a more current government security with higher coupon rate (6.48% vs 6.33%). Market participants will need to execute trades to rebalance their index-linked portfolios, potentially creating trading volumes in both the incoming and outgoing securities around the effective date.
