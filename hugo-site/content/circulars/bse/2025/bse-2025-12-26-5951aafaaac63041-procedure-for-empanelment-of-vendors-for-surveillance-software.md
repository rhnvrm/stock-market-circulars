---

## Summary

BSE has established a formal procedure for empanelment of surveillance software vendors. Trading members using surveillance software (either in-house developed or third-party) must seek BSE's registration by submitting an application with required details. The circular references SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-PoD 1/P/CIR/2024/96 dated July 04, 2024, and BSE notices dated July 01, 2021 and December 31, 2024. Members using in-house surveillance software must execute an undertaking on Rs. 1000/- stamp paper (or applicable state stamp duty, whichever is higher), duly notarized.

## Key Points

- Two types of surveillance software covered: In-house developed and Third-party vendor software
- Application required for all segments: Cash Market (CM), Futures & Options (F&O), Currency Derivatives (CDS), and Commodity Options (CO)
- Members must provide surveillance software vendor name and version details
- Application must be submitted by authorized signatory with stamp/seal
- In-house software requires execution of undertaking on stamp paper
- Undertaking must be notarized on all pages and signed by authorized signatory
- Trading members must declare all information provided is complete, true, and based on verifiable records
- Members must inform BSE immediately of any changes to furnished information

## Regulatory Changes

Formalization of surveillance software empanelment process for trading members. This builds upon:
- SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-PoD 1/P/CIR/2024/96 dated July 04, 2024
- BSE notice no. 20210701-30 dated July 01, 2021
- BSE notice no. 20241231-66 dated December 31, 2024

Establishes structured application and undertaking framework for both in-house and third-party surveillance software registration.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Submit Annexure I application form with member code, name, and surveillance software details
- Specify application type (in-house or third-party)
- Indicate applicable segments (CM, F&O, CDS, CO)
- Provide surveillance software vendor name and version
- Authorization by designated signatory with stamp/seal

**For In-house Surveillance Software:**
- Execute Annexure II undertaking on Rs. 1000/- stamp paper or applicable state stamp duty (whichever is higher)
- Get undertaking notarized on all pages
- Sign, stamp, and seal by authorized signatory on all pages
- Provide entity details (individual/partnership/LLP/company)

- Maintain verifiable records for all furnished information

## Important Dates

No specific deadline mentioned. Circular establishes ongoing procedure for empanelment.

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** High - All trading members using surveillance software across any segment must comply with this registration and empanelment procedure. Members with in-house solutions face additional documentation requirements including notarized undertakings on stamp paper.

**Compliance Burden:** Moderate to High - Requires formal application process, auditor certification for in-house software, legal documentation on stamp paper, and ongoing obligation to report changes.

**Market Surveillance:** Positive - Strengthens market surveillance framework by ensuring all surveillance software used by members is registered and meets BSE/SEBI standards, enhancing market integrity and investor protection.

**Vendor Impact:** Third-party surveillance software vendors will need to work with trading members to complete empanelment process, potentially creating standardization in surveillance tools used across the market.
