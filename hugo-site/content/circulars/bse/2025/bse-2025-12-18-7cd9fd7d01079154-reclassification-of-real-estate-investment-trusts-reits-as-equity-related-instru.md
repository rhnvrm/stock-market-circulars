title: Reclassification of REITs as Equity Related Instruments for Mutual Funds and
  SIFs
---

## Summary

SEBI has reclassified Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) as equity related instruments effective January 1, 2026, through gazette notification SEBI/LAD-NRO/GN/2025/272 dated October 31, 2025. This change amends the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, and aims to facilitate enhanced participation by Mutual Funds and Specialized Investment Funds (SIFs) in REITs. InvITs will continue to be classified as hybrid instruments.

## Key Points

- REITs will be treated as equity related instruments for Mutual Funds and SIFs from January 1, 2026
- InvITs remain classified as hybrid instruments (no change)
- Existing REIT investments in debt schemes as of December 31, 2025 are grandfathered
- AMCs are encouraged to divest REITs from debt scheme portfolios considering market conditions
- AMFI to include REITs in market capitalization classification list
- Scheme document amendments through addendum will not be considered fundamental attribute changes
- REITs can only be included in equity indices after July 1, 2026 (six-month waiting period)

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has amended the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 through gazette notification no. SEBI/LAD-NRO/GN/2025/272 dated October 31, 2025. The key regulatory change is the reclassification of REITs from their previous classification to equity related instruments under Regulation 2(1)(ja). This change aligns REIT investments with equity investment guidelines for Mutual Funds and SIFs.

## Compliance Requirements

**For AMCs (Asset Management Companies):**
- Issue addendums to scheme documents reflecting the reclassification of REITs
- Make necessary changes to investment strategies for schemes holding or planning to invest in REITs
- Encouraged to divest REITs from debt scheme portfolios while considering market conditions, liquidity, and investor interests

**For AMFI (Association of Mutual Funds in India):**
- Include REITs in the classification list of scrips according to market capitalization as per para 2.7 of the Master Circular for Mutual Funds dated June 27, 2024

**For Index Providers:**
- Defer inclusion of REITs in equity indices until after July 1, 2026

**Grandfathering Provision:**
- Existing REIT investments held by debt schemes and investment strategies of SIFs as of December 31, 2025 are grandfathered and need not be immediately divested

## Important Dates

- **November 28, 2025**: BSE circular issued
- **December 31, 2025**: Cut-off date for grandfathering existing REIT investments in debt schemes
- **January 1, 2026**: Effective date for REIT reclassification as equity related instruments
- **July 1, 2026**: Earliest date for inclusion of REITs in equity indices (six-month waiting period)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Expected to increase institutional participation in REITs from Mutual Funds and SIFs
- May enhance liquidity in the REIT market

- Investment strategies and risk profiles of schemes holding REITs will need reassessment
- Scheme documentation across the industry requires updating

**Investor Impact:**

- Equity scheme investors may see increased REIT exposure
- Scheme fundamental attributes remain unchanged despite the reclassification
- Enhanced investment opportunities in real estate sector through equity schemes
