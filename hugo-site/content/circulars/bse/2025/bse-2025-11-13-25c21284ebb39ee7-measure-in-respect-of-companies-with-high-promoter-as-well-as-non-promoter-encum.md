## Summary

Effective November 14, 2025, NR Agarwal Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 516082, ISIN: INE740D01017) has been added to the framework. The consolidated list now includes 2 securities: India Finsec Ltd and NR Agarwal Industries Ltd. No securities are being removed from the framework.

## Key Points

- No securities moving out of the framework
- Consolidated list contains 2 securities under this measure
- Framework based on SEBI SAST Regulation 28(3) regarding pledged shares
- Effective date: November 14, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements SEBI's regulatory framework under Regulation 28(3) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulation 2011, which addresses situations where companies have high levels of both promoter and non-promoter shareholding encumbrance. The measure aims to identify and monitor securities where significant portions of shares are pledged or encumbered, potentially indicating financial stress or governance concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should be aware of the enhanced surveillance status of listed securities
- Trading members and investors should note the elevated risk profile of securities under this framework
- Companies included in this framework may face additional disclosure and monitoring requirements
- Investors should exercise heightened due diligence when trading in these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 14, 2025 - NR Agarwal Industries Ltd enters the high encumbrance framework

## Impact Assessment

The addition of NR Agarwal Industries Ltd to this framework indicates elevated levels of share pledging by both promoter and non-promoter shareholders, which may signal financial stress or liquidity concerns. This measure serves as a cautionary signal to market participants. The consolidated framework now covers 2 securities (India Finsec Ltd and NR Agarwal Industries Ltd), both subject to enhanced surveillance. Investors should exercise caution when trading these securities as high encumbrance levels can lead to forced selling in adverse market conditions, increased volatility, and potential governance issues. The measure helps maintain market integrity by flagging securities with elevated risk profiles.
