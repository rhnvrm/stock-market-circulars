## Key Points

- Partly paid shareholders must pay call money of ₹2.50 plus 10% interest from November 30, 1985
- Offer not conditional on minimum acceptance level
- No competing offers as of offer date

## Regulatory Changes

Offer made under regulation 3(1) and regulation 4 of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011. Compliance with substantial acquisition disclosure requirements triggered the mandatory open offer.
