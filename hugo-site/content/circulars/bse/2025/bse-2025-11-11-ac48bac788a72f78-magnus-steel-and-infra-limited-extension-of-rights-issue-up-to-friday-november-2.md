  November 21, 2025
---

## Summary

Magnus Steel and Infra Limited (formerly Magnus Retail Limited) has extended the closing date of its Rights Issue by one week. The Rights Issue Committee meeting held on November 11, 2025, decided to extend the issue closure from Friday, November 14, 2025 to Friday, November 21, 2025. This extension aims to provide shareholders additional time to exercise their rights and submit applications.

## Key Points

- Original closing date was Friday, November 14, 2025
- New closing date is Friday, November 21, 2025 (extended by 7 days)
- Rights Issue Committee meeting held on November 11, 2025 approved the extension
- Committee meeting duration: 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM

- No changes to LOF, CAF, and ALOF dated October 14, 2025 except issue closing date

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a procedural extension of an existing rights issue timeline.

## Compliance Requirements

- Eligible equity shareholders should note the revised closing date of November 21, 2025
- Shareholders must submit duly filled CAF (Composite Application Form) along with applicable payment by the new closing date
- The last date mentioned for CAF submission was originally November 10, 2025 (note: this appears to be an error in the circular as it predates the new closing date)
