## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This circular implements existing surveillance mechanisms through price band adjustments to control excessive volatility and ensure orderly trading in specific securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands from November 27, 2025
- All trades in affected scrips must comply with new price band limits
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect revised price movement restrictions
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 26, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 27, 2025 - Revised price bands become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements for these five securities, with the tightest control (5% band) on Mega Nirman and Industries Ltd and widest bands (20%) on Advent Hotels International Ltd and TUNI Textile Mills Ltd. This may reduce trading volumes and liquidity in these scrips while preventing excessive volatility.

**Trading Impact**: Investors and traders in these securities will experience limited price discovery within the specified bands. The 5% band on Mega Nirman and Industries Ltd indicates significant surveillance concerns, while 20% bands suggest these securities can handle wider price fluctuations.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their risk management systems and inform clients trading in these securities about the revised movement limits before market opening on November 27, 2025.
