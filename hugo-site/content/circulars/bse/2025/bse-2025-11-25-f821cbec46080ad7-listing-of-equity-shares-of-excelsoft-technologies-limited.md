## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - This is a new listing with substantial shares under lock-in, which will restrict supply and potentially support price stability in the near term. The staggered lock-in expiry dates (1 month, 3 months, 1 year, and 3 years) will gradually increase tradable float over time.

**Liquidity Impact**: Initial trading liquidity will be limited to IPO public shares (~2.5 crore) and ESOP shares (~1.03 crore), representing approximately 30% of total shares. Full liquidity will only be available after the final lock-in expires in November 2028.

**Investor Impact**: Long-term investors and promoters are locked in for extended periods (up to 3 years), demonstrating commitment. ESOP holders have immediate trading flexibility, which may create near-term selling pressure.
