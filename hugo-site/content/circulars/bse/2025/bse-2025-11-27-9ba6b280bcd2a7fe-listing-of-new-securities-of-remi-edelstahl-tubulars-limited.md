## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. The preferential allotment represents a modest equity dilution. With the majority of shares (695,893 out of 962,893) locked in until June 2026 and the remaining tranche locked until May 2027, there will be minimal immediate impact on free float or trading volumes.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders experience dilution from the preferential issue. The lock-in periods indicate confidence from allottees but restrict liquidity in these specific shares.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal operational changes for trading members beyond noting the new securities and enforcing lock-in restrictions on the specified distribution numbers.
