## Impact Assessment

This auction impacts brokers and clients who failed to deliver securities in the normal settlement cycle. The presence of high-value stocks like Infosys (113 shares), Bank of Baroda (2,000 shares), and ICICI Bank (66 shares) indicates significant value at stake. Parties with short delivery positions will need to participate in the auction to close out their obligations, potentially at unfavorable prices depending on auction dynamics. The wide range of securities (90 different scrips) suggests settlement issues across multiple brokers and market segments.
