This is a significant OFS event involving up to 57.76 crore shares (including oversubscription) of Indian Overseas Bank, which will impact the stock's liquidity and price discovery. The floor price of Rs. 34.00 establishes a reference point for the bidding process.

**Investor Categories Affected:**
- Institutional investors (MF, IC, FII, Banks) get first bidding day access
- Retail investors (bid value up to Rs. 2 lakhs) get dedicated T+1 day access with carry-forward option
- Non-institutional investors (bid value above Rs. 2 lakhs) bid on T Day
- Employees get special quota (1.5 lakh shares, bid value up to Rs. 5 lakhs)

**Operational Impact:**
The staggered bidding schedule separates institutional and retail participation, allowing for orderly price discovery. The price priority allocation method ensures competitive bidding. The 0% margin option for institutional investors provides flexibility while retail investors require full upfront margin for investor protection.
