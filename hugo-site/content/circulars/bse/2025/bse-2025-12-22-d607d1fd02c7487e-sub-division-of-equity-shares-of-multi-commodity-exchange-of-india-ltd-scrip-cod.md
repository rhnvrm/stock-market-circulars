- Trading members should await separate notice for the new ISIN number for Rs.2/- paid up shares
- All transactions from January 2, 2026 onwards must use the new ISIN and reflect the sub-divided share structure

## Important Dates

- **December 22, 2025**: Circular issued
- **January 2, 2026**: Record date for sub-division
- **January 2, 2026**: Effective date for trading at new Rs.2/- face value
- **January 2, 2026**: Old ISIN becomes invalid for transactions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The stock sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the face value proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors. The market capitalization and shareholder value remain unchanged.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new ISIN and face value from January 2, 2026. Shareholders will see their holdings increase 5x in quantity while the value per share decreases proportionately. Demat accounts will be automatically credited with the additional shares based on the record date holdings.
