## Key Points

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The migration from T2T to Rolling settlement will significantly improve liquidity for Purple Wave Infocom Limited shares. Investors will benefit from intraday trading opportunities and potentially tighter bid-ask spreads.

**Market Participants**: Trading members and brokers need to ensure system readiness for the transition. Existing positions in the stock should be monitored during the transition period.

**Investor Impact**: Medium positive impact - shareholders will experience enhanced liquidity and reduced settlement restrictions, making the stock more attractive for regular trading activities versus the constrained T2T mechanism.
