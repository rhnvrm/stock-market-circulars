- **Recent Sellers**: Those who have recently sold their shares should hand over this Letter of Offer to the purchaser or the stock exchange member through whom the sale was effected

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This is a significant corporate action involving change of control in Avishkar Infra Realty Limited. The mandatory open offer affects all public shareholders who hold the remaining equity shares after the preferential allotment.

**Shareholder Impact**: Public shareholders have an exit opportunity at ₹16 per share. The inclusion of 10% p.a. interest for delay in payment provides compensation for the delayed open offer following the February 2024 trigger event.

**Corporate Governance**: The offer demonstrates compliance with takeover regulations following substantial acquisition through preferential route. The unconditional nature of the offer (no minimum acceptance threshold) provides certainty to tendering shareholders.

**Price Consideration**: Shareholders should evaluate the ₹16 offer price against current market price and intrinsic value. The possibility of upward revision until December 22, 2025 should be monitored.
