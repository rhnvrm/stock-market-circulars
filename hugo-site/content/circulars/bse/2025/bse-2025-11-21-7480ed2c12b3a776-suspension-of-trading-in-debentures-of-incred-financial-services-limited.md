The suspension is due to the company fixing the record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the specified date.

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard operational suspension aligned with existing market practices for corporate actions on debt securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from November 27, 2025
- All pending orders for these debentures should be cancelled or withdrawn before the suspension date
- Members should inform clients holding or intending to trade these securities about the suspension

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 21, 2025

- **Trading Suspension From**: November 27, 2025
- **Maturity Date**: December 12, 2025 (as indicated by security name)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. The suspension affects only holders and potential traders of this specific NCD series. The debenture is approaching its maturity date (December 12, 2025), so this is an expected corporate action.

**Investor Impact**: Medium for NCD holders. Investors holding these debentures will receive their redemption proceeds and final interest payment but cannot trade the securities from November 27, 2025. This is a standard process and investors should have anticipated this based on the maturity timeline.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine suspension for debt securities undergoing redemption. Trading members need to ensure systems and client communications are updated to prevent inadvertent trades in the suspended security.
