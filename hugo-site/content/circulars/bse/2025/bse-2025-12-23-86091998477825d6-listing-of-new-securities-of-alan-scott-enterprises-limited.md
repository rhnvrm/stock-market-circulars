## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market impact as it involves a relatively small preferential allotment of 2.7 lakh shares to non-promoters. The shares carry a six-month lock-in period, preventing immediate trading of the allotted quantity. The issue price of Rs. 250/- represents a significant premium over face value, indicating investor confidence. Market participants should note the lock-in restrictions when assessing available float for trading purposes.
