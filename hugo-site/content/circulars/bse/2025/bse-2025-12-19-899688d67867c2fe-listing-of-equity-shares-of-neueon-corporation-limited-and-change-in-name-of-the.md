## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing public shareholders face significant dilution, retaining only 10% of total equity while 90% transfers to the Resolution Applicant. Face value reduction from Rs. 10/- to Rs. 1/- affects per-share metrics.

**Trading Impact**: Classification in T Group with Trade-to-Trade segment means no intraday trading, delivery-based settlement only, and higher surveillance - typically indicating regulatory concerns or volatility.

**Market Perception**: Emergence from insolvency proceedings under IBC signals corporate restructuring. The "Corporate Debtor" designation and restrictive trading category may impact liquidity and investor sentiment negatively.

**Operational Impact**: Use of temporary ISIN for dematerialized shares requires coordination between depositories and market participants for proper credit to investor accounts post-restructuring.
