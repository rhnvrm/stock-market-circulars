## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in partly paid equity shares of Fusion Finance Limited (Scrip Code 890214) effective November 11, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date to identify shareholders eligible to receive the first and final call notice for partly paid-up equity shares.

## Key Points

- Trading in partly paid equity shares suspended from November 11, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-753/2025-2026)
- Record date fixed as November 11, 2025
- First and final call amount: Rs. 65.50 per share (Rs. 5.00 face value + Rs. 60.50 premium)
- Trading members advised not to deal in these partly paid shares
- Notice issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President - Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational measure implemented when companies fix record dates for call money on partly paid shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealings in partly paid equity shares of Fusion Finance Limited from November 11, 2025
- Trading members are required to take note of this suspension and ensure compliance
- Shareholders holding partly paid shares must be prepared to pay the first and final call amount of Rs. 65.50 per share

## Important Dates

- **November 7, 2025**: Circular notice date
- **November 11, 2025**: Record date for determining eligible shareholders
- **November 11, 2025**: No dealings commence (Settlement DR-753/2025-2026)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Complete trading halt for partly paid shares affects liquidity and prevents any transactions in these securities.

**Shareholder Impact**: High - Shareholders holding partly paid shares must arrange Rs. 65.50 per share to fulfill the first and final call obligation. Failure to pay may result in forfeiture of shares.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update systems to block trades in scrip code 890214 (partly paid shares) and inform clients holding these shares about the call money requirement and trading suspension.
