title: Listing of Further Securities Issued by 13 Companies under ESOP/ESOS
---

## Summary

BSE has listed further securities issued by 13 companies under Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS), effective from Friday, October 31, 2025. The companies include major banks like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, along with technology, insurance, and other sector companies. None of the newly listed shares are under lock-in.

## Key Points

- Total of 13 companies listing additional securities through ESOP/ESOS
- Effective date: October 31, 2025
- HDFC Bank issuing the largest number: 12,994,998 shares (face value ₹1)
- ICICI Bank: 736,701 shares (face value ₹2)
- FSN E-Commerce (Nykaa): 321,070 shares (face value ₹1)
- UNO Minda: 607,938 shares (face value ₹2)
- No lock-in period applicable for any of the listed securities
- All shares are admitted for trading on the Exchange

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities available for trading
- Companies have complied with listing requirements for ESOP/ESOS issuances
- Securities can be traded immediately from the effective date with no restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 30, 2025
- **Listing and Trading Effective Date:** October 31, 2025
- **Lock-in Period:** Not applicable (NA) for all securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. These are routine ESOP/ESOS share listings that represent employee compensation and are typically small relative to companies' total outstanding shares. The largest issuance by HDFC Bank (12.99 million shares) represents a minimal percentage of its total equity base.

**Trading Impact:** Minimal dilution effect expected. While HDFC Bank's issuance is substantial in absolute numbers, it's standard practice for large corporations with extensive employee stock programs. No lock-in restrictions mean shares are immediately tradable.

**Operational Impact:** None for trading members beyond awareness of additional floating stock.
