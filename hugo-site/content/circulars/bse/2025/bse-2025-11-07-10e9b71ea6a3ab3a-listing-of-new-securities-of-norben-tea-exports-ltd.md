## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market impact as it involves a relatively small number of shares (6,58,000) from warrant conversion for Norben Tea & Exports Ltd. The shares are subject to lock-in until May 20, 2026, preventing immediate sale by allottees. The preferential issue to non-promoters at Rs. 17/- per share provides capital to the company while the lock-in period ensures stability. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and lock-in restrictions.
