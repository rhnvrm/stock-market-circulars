## Summary

BSE has introduced Specialized Investment Funds (SIF) of Tata Mutual Fund on the BSE StAR MF Platform. The circular outlines investment eligibility criteria for Accredited and Non-Accredited Investors, establishes minimum investment thresholds, and specifies distributor registration requirements. A separate AMC creation has been activated for SIF schemes, and distributors must pass NISM XIII examination and register with AMFI to distribute SIF products.

## Key Points

- SIF client AUM must not fall below ₹10 lakh due to redemption or any other reason
- Distributors must pass NISM XIII examination and register with AMFI to distribute SIF schemes
- BSE platform provides manual and bulk upload facility for updating Accredited Investor details
- Accredited Investor details frozen at order entry level for fresh/lumpsum subscriptions creating new folios
- For joint holdings, AI status depends on first holder classification across all transaction types
