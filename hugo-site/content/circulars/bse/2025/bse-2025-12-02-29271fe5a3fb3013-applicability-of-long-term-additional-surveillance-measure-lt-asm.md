## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework is a surveillance mechanism applied to securities based on specific criteria related to price movements, volatility, and other market parameters. Securities under this framework face additional trading restrictions and surveillance to protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of the changed surveillance status of affected securities
- Trading members should note the additional compliance and reporting requirements for LT-ASM securities
- Investors trading in these securities should understand the enhanced surveillance measures and potential trading restrictions
- Securities in Stage IV face stricter surveillance measures compared to Stage I

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 03, 2025 - All changes to LT-ASM Framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of securities in the LT-ASM Framework typically results in:

- Reduced liquidity due to additional trading restrictions
- Higher margin requirements for positions in these securities
- Increased scrutiny of trading activity
- Potential price impact due to changed trading conditions
- Enhanced investor caution and due diligence requirements

For securities moving out of LT-ASM into ESM or GSM frameworks, different surveillance measures will apply. The direct placement of two securities into Stage IV indicates serious surveillance concerns requiring immediate stricter measures.
