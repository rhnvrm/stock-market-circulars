## Impact Assessment

**Member Impact:**
High impact on all active BSE trading members. The mandatory nature of this submission, combined with penal consequences for non-compliance, makes this a critical compliance obligation. Members must ensure timely data compilation and submission through BEFS to avoid financial penalties and regulatory disciplinary action.

**Market Impact:**
Low direct market impact. This is an internal member compliance requirement and does not affect trading operations or market participants directly. However, it supports the Exchange's risk monitoring framework which contributes to overall market integrity and member supervision.

**Operational Impact:**
Medium operational impact on members who need to gather, compile, and submit comprehensive RBS data covering six months of operations. Members should allocate adequate resources to ensure accurate and timely submission before the deadline.
