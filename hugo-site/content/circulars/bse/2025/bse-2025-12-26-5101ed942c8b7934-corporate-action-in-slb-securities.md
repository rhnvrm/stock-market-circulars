## Impact Assessment

This circular has moderate impact on SLB market participants holding positions in TCS, MCX, or CAMS securities. During the shut periods, new SLB transactions in these securities will not be permitted, requiring participants to plan their positions accordingly. The stock split in MCX will require adjustment of existing SLB positions. Dividend distributions in TCS and CAMS will affect settlement obligations for borrowed securities. Market participants should review their SLB portfolios and take necessary actions before the foreclosure dates to avoid forced closure of positions.
