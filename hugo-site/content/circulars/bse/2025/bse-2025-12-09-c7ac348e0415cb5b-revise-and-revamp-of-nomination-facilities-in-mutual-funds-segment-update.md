title: Revise and Revamp of Nomination Facilities in Mutual Funds Segment - Update
---

## Summary

SEBI has mandated that all mutual fund investors must either designate a nominee or formally opt-out of nomination facilities. This applies to both existing and new investors. The opt-out process requires OTP-based two-factor authentication along with either a signed declaration or video verification. Starting December 15, 2025, transactions for fresh folio creation under non-demat mode without proper nomination compliance will be rejected at the AMC/RTA level.

## Key Points

- All mutual fund investors must either nominate or formally opt-out
- Applies to both existing and new investors
- Authentication requires OTP-based 2FA with signed declaration or video verification
- Member must generate unique reference number for opt-out documentation
- Nominations can be registered at UCC level or Folio level at AMC/RTA
- Nomination details can be modified later with re-authentication
- Members must upload and store opt-out documents for regulatory inspection
- Documents must be provided to RTA/AMC/Regulator when required

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has introduced comprehensive nomination requirements for mutual fund investments:

- **Mandatory Action**: Investors must either nominate or opt-out; no middle ground
- **Authentication Protocol**: Two-factor OTP authentication required for all holders in UCC
- **Documentation**: Opt-out requires signed declaration form or video recording
- **Reference System**: Unique reference number must be generated and maintained by members
- **Record Keeping**: Members must maintain opt-out documents and provide to regulators on demand

## Compliance Requirements

**For Investors:**
- Complete nomination or opt-out process online or offline
- Authenticate via OTP on registered email ID and mobile number
- Submit formal declaration form or video recording for opt-out
- All holders in UCC must complete authentication

**For Members/Intermediaries:**
- Generate unique reference number during opt-out process
- Upload Nomination Opt-Out Declaration forms via Admin >> Client Details >> ELog/Image Upload or existing API interface
- Store opt-out documentation securely
- Provide records to RTA/AMC/Regulator as required
- Reject non-compliant fresh folio transactions from December 15, 2025

**Authentication Requirements:**
- OTP sent to all holders' registered email and mobile
- Re-authentication required for any nomination changes
- No OTP required if only adding reference number without changing authentication mode

## Important Dates

- **December 15, 2025**: Mandatory compliance date - transactions for fresh folio creation under non-demat mode without proper nomination compliance will be rejected at AMC/RTA level

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Market Participants:**

- **All Mutual Fund Investors**: Must take action to either nominate or opt-out to avoid transaction rejections
- **Intermediaries/Members**: Must implement systems for authentication, reference number generation, and document storage
- **AMCs/RTAs**: Must enforce rejection of non-compliant transactions from December 15, 2025
- **Fresh Folio Creation**: Non-compliant requests will be rejected, potentially disrupting new investments
- **Operational Changes**: Members need to upgrade systems for OTP authentication, document upload, and reference number management
- **Compliance Burden**: Increased documentation and record-keeping requirements for all market participants
