## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in two series of non-convertible debentures issued by India Infradebt Limited effective November 4, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing the record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these specified debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Two debenture series affected: IIL-8.5%-19-11-25-PVT (ISIN: INE537P07067, Code: 953010) and IIL-8%-19-11-25-PVT (ISIN: INE537P07547, Code: 959508)
- Record date fixed as November 4, 2025 for both series
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Trading members instructed not to deal in these debentures from November 4, 2025
- Notice number: 20251029-14 under reference DR-749/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard market action pursuant to corporate action procedures for debenture redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute trades in the specified debentures from November 4, 2025
- Trading members are required to take note of the suspension and ensure compliance
- All dealings in the affected securities must cease from the specified date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 29, 2025
- **Record Date**: November 4, 2025
- **No Dealings From**: November 4, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and potential traders of these specific debenture series. This is a routine corporate action associated with scheduled redemption. Debenture holders on record as of November 4, 2025 will receive redemption proceeds and final interest payment. The suspension ensures proper settlement of the redemption process and prevents trading during the record date period. No broader market impact is anticipated as this affects only two specific debt instruments.
