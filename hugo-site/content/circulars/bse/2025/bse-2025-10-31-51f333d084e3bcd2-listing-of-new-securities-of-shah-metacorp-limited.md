These shares were issued to promoters on a preferential basis at Rs. 4.02 per share (including premium of Rs. 3.02) pursuant to conversion of warrants. The shares are locked-in until May 2, 2027.

## Key Points

- 3.55 crore new equity shares listed with effect from Monday, November 3, 2025
- Shares issued at Rs. 4.02 per share (Re. 1/- face value + Rs. 3.02 premium)
- Issued to promoters on preferential basis following warrant conversion
- Date of allotment: June 9, 2025
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares
- Distribution Numbers: 593878677 to 629378676

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification following SEBI's preferential allotment and warrant conversion regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the new securities for trading
- All 3.55 crore shares are subject to mandatory lock-in provisions
- Shares cannot be transferred or traded until lock-in expiry

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: June 9, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: November 3, 2025 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: May 2, 2027
- **Notice Date**: October 31, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. Routine listing of preferentially allotted shares with extended lock-in period.

**Shareholder Impact**: Dilution of existing shareholding by addition of 3.55 crore shares. However, since shares are issued to promoters and locked-in for approximately 18 months from trading date, no immediate trading impact expected.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact as all shares are under lock-in until May 2027. Post lock-in expiry, may increase free float depending on promoter selling decisions.
