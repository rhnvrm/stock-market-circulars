## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine corporate action involving employee stock options. The share quantities being listed represent incremental dilution for existing shareholders but are typical for ESOP/ESOS programs.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal - The additional shares will increase the float marginally for each company. The largest addition is 905,489 shares for Le Travenues Technology Limited.

**Sector Distribution**: The circular covers diverse sectors including financial services (Aptus, Five-Star, IIFL, Equitas), technology (Tata Technologies, Zensar, L&T Technology Services), pharmaceuticals (Lupin, Solara, Sai Life Sciences), and others, indicating broad-based employee stock option activity across the market.
