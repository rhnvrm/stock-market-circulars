## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to a routine commercial paper issuance by Time Technoplast Limited. The instruments are short-term debt securities (6-month maturity) rated A1+ by both CRISIL and ICRA, indicating highest credit quality. The issue size of Rs. 25 crores is modest and will primarily interest institutional investors and debt market participants seeking short-term, highly-rated paper. Trading will be restricted to the BSE Debt segment with standard parameters. No impact on equity markets or broader trading operations.
