## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced by this circular. This is a standard listing notification following preferential allotment procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the listing of new securities for trading purposes

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. The preferential allotment represents a small dilution of equity base and involves non-promoter investors. Lock-in restrictions ensure these shares will not be available for trading until mid-2026, limiting near-term supply. This is a routine corporate action for capital raising purposes with no immediate trading implications beyond increased authorized share count.
