## Impact Assessment

This is a standard preferential allotment listing with minimal market impact. The issuance represents additional equity capital raised by Vikram Kamat's Hospitality Limited from non-promoter investors. The lock-in period until June 30, 2026 ensures these shares cannot be traded for approximately 6 months from the listing date, preventing immediate supply pressure. The shares rank equally with existing equity shares in terms of voting rights and dividends.
