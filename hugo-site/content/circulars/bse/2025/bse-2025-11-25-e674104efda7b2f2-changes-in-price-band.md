title: Revision of Price Bands for 15 Securities Effective November 26, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced revision of price bands for 15 securities effective from November 26, 2025. The changes include major stocks like Tata Motors Ltd moving to a 20% price band and Allcargo Logistics Ltd also at 20%, while several smaller companies have tighter bands ranging from 2% to 10%. Price bands are regulatory tools that limit the maximum price movement of a security in a single trading session, with tighter bands indicating heightened surveillance or volatility concerns.

## Key Points

- 15 securities will have revised price bands from November 26, 2025
- Tata Motors Ltd price band revised to 20% (scrip code 544569)
- Allcargo Logistics Ltd price band revised to 20% (scrip code 532749)
- Four companies have strictest 2% band: CHPL Industries, MRC Agrotech, SAB Events & Governance Now Media, and Svarnim Trade Udyog
- Five companies have 5% band: Bil Vyapar, Gopal Iron & Steels, Pro Fin Capital Services, TCM, and Vuenow Infratech
- Four companies have 10% band: Astec Lifesciences, M P K Steels, Olatech Solutions, and Regal Entertainment & Consultants
- Notice issued by BSE Surveillance department

## Regulatory Changes

Price band percentages determine the maximum allowable price movement (up or down) from the previous day's closing price. The revised bands represent BSE's assessment of appropriate trading ranges for these securities based on factors such as volatility, market capitalization, liquidity, and surveillance requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands in their systems before market opening on November 26, 2025
- All trades must comply with new price band limits from the effective date
- For clarifications, members should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** November 25, 2025
- **Effective Date:** November 26, 2025 (market opening)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The revision affects trading dynamics for 15 securities. Tata Motors and Allcargo Logistics receiving 20% bands suggests normalization of trading conditions, allowing greater intraday price movement. Conversely, companies with 2% bands (CHPL Industries, MRC Agrotech, SAB Events, Svarnim Trade Udyog) face strictest controls, indicating enhanced surveillance measures possibly due to unusual volatility, low liquidity, or compliance concerns.

**Trading Impact:** Tighter bands (2-5%) limit arbitrage opportunities and may reduce liquidity, while protecting against excessive speculation. Wider bands (20%) for Tata Motors align with blue-chip trading norms and improve market efficiency for institutional participants.

**Investor Impact:** Investors in securities with tighter bands should expect limited intraday price movement and potentially wider bid-ask spreads. Those holding Tata Motors and Allcargo Logistics benefit from improved price discovery and liquidity.
