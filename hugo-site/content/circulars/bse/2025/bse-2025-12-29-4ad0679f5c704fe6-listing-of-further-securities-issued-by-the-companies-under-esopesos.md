## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal to low. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares represents routine corporate actions and typically causes marginal dilution to existing shareholders. The share quantities being listed are relatively small compared to the overall market capitalization of these companies.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible increase in floating stock for these companies. Most shares have no lock-in restrictions and will be immediately tradeable.

**Company-Specific Notes:**
- ITC Ltd: 195,210 shares (₹1 face value) - minimal dilution given company's large market cap
- AXIS Bank: 502,455 shares (₹2 face value) - routine employee option exercises
- UNICOMMERCE: 1,017,088 shares - largest number of shares but relatively small company
- Bliss GVS Pharma: 66,380 shares under lock-in until June 9, 2025

**Investor Impact:** No material impact on existing shareholders. ESOP/ESOS exercises are standard practice and anticipated dilution events.
