## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Debenture Holders**: Medium impact for holders of these specific debentures who will receive partial redemption proceeds and interest payment. The reduced face value reflects the return of principal through part redemption.

**Market Impact**: Low to medium - affects only holders of this specific private placement debenture series. The part redemption reduces outstanding debt and returns capital to investors while maintaining the instrument with a lower face value for remaining tenure until September 2026 maturity.

**Liquidity**: The reduced face value may affect trading dynamics and pricing calculations for remaining debenture holders.
