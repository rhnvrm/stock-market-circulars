## Regulatory Changes

The exchange has modified price band percentages from existing levels for surveillance purposes. Price bands restrict the maximum percentage change in stock price during a trading session, serving as a circuit breaker mechanism to prevent excessive volatility.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands in their trading systems before market opening on December 24, 2025
- All orders and trades must comply with new price band limits from the effective date
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 23, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Traders and investors in these 13 securities will face stricter or modified intraday price movement limits. Securities with tighter bands (2%) will have limited price discovery within a single session, potentially requiring multiple days for significant price adjustments. This may impact liquidity and trading strategies for these stocks.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to reflect new price bands. Algorithmic trading systems and risk management tools need recalibration to account for revised circuit limits.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors should be aware that intraday price movements will be capped at the new band percentages, which may affect order execution and exit strategies for volatile market conditions.
