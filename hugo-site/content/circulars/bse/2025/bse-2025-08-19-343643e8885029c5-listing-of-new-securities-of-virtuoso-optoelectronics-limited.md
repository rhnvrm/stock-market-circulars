- Distribution numbers: 26338757 to 29488756
- ISIN: INE0I0T01010

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing of new securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members informed of new securities availability
- Lock-in period applicable until February 28, 2026
- All 31,50,000 shares subject to lock-in restrictions

## Important Dates

- Allotment Date: March 1, 2025
- Trading Commencement: August 20, 2025
- Lock-in Period Ends: February 28, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact as the preferential allotment increases the company's share capital by 31,50,000 shares. The lock-in period until February 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure. This represents dilution for existing shareholders but provides additional capital to the company.
