## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing represents a small preferential allotment of 5 lakh shares issued through warrant conversion. This is a routine corporate action with no immediate trading impact as shares remain locked-in until mid-2026.

**Liquidity Impact**: Neutral in the short term due to lock-in period. Post lock-in expiry on June 30, 2026, these shares may add marginal liquidity to the counter.

**Investor Impact**: Informational for existing shareholders. The preferential allotment to Non-Promoters may have minor dilution effects, but shares rank pari-passu with existing equity. Lock-in provides stability until June 2026.
