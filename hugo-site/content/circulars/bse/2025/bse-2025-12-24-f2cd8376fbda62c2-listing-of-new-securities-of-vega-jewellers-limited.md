## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing notice affecting a single company with a relatively small number of shares (1,99,554 shares valued at approximately Rs. 1.1 crore at issue price).

**Operational Impact**: Trading members should update their systems to reflect the expanded share capital of Vega Jewellers Limited. The lock-in period until June 30, 2026 means these shares cannot be traded freely for approximately 18 months from the listing date.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect from the preferential allotment. The shares were issued pursuant to warrant conversion, indicating this was a planned capital raising activity by the company.
