## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in two series of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) issued by Muthoot Finance Limited. The suspension is effective from December 26, 2025, as the company has fixed December 27, 2025 as the record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these specified debentures from the suspension date.

- Record date set for December 27, 2025
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- No dealings permitted from December 26, 2025
- Notice issued under reference DR-785/2025-2026
- Circular issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance and Operations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action notification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures (ISIN: INE414G07FK7 and INE414G07FO9) from December 26, 2025
- Trading members must take note of the suspension and communicate to relevant clients holding these debentures
- Debenture holders as on record date (December 27, 2025) will be eligible for redemption proceeds and interest payment

## Important Dates

- **December 19, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **December 26, 2025**: No dealings commence (trading suspension begins)
- **December 27, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited, as this affects only two specific debenture series of Muthoot Finance Limited. The suspension is temporary and procedural in nature.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders of the affected series should note that they cannot trade these instruments from December 26, 2025. Only those holding the debentures on the record date will receive redemption proceeds and interest payments.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to block trading in these specific ISINs from the suspension date to ensure compliance with BSE requirements.
