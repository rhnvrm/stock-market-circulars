## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a company-specific listing announcement affecting Indo Thai Securities Limited only. The preferential allotment represents additional equity capital raised through warrant conversion.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact as all shares are under lock-in until May 2026, restricting their tradability for approximately 6 months from the listing date.

**Investor Consideration**: Investors should note the lock-in restrictions preventing immediate sale of these shares by allottees until mid-May 2026.
