A total of 5 securities are being newly shortlisted for ESM, 2 securities are moving to higher ESM stages, 22 securities are moving to lower ESM stages, and 20 securities are exiting the framework.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework is BSE's mechanism to monitor securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or trading patterns. Securities in ESM framework face additional surveillance and trading restrictions based on their stage. Movement between stages reflects ongoing assessment of trading behavior and compliance. The framework operates in multiple stages with progressively stricter surveillance measures at higher stages.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of ESM status of securities
- Enhanced reporting and monitoring requirements apply to securities under ESM
- Price bands and trading restrictions may apply based on ESM stage
- Investors should exercise additional caution when trading in ESM securities
- Brokers must ensure client awareness of ESM status before executing trades

## Important Dates

- **December 1, 2025**: Effective date for all ESM framework changes including new additions, stage movements, and exits

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Securities newly added to ESM may experience reduced liquidity and increased volatility due to stricter surveillance measures. Securities moving to higher stages face tighter restrictions, while those moving to lower stages or exiting gain more trading flexibility.

**Trading Impact**: Enhanced surveillance typically includes stricter price bands, additional margin requirements, and increased monitoring. Traders and investors in the 49 affected securities should review their positions and understand the applicable restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Retail investors holding ESM securities should be aware of potential liquidity constraints and higher transaction costs. Securities exiting ESM framework may see improved trading conditions and market participation.
