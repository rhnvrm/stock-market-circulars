## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The price band revisions indicate increased surveillance on these 26 securities, suggesting concerns about volatility or unusual price movements. Tighter bands will limit intraday price fluctuations and reduce speculative trading activity.

**Trading Impact:** Traders and investors in these securities will face restrictions on maximum price movement per trading session. The 2% band on Empower India Ltd is particularly restrictive, while the 20% bands allow relatively more flexibility.

**Liquidity Impact:** Stricter price bands may temporarily reduce liquidity as large orders may hit band limits. This could increase execution time for significant positions.

**Investor Impact:** Investors should be aware that these securities are under enhanced surveillance, which may indicate higher risk profiles or regulatory concerns requiring due diligence before trading.
