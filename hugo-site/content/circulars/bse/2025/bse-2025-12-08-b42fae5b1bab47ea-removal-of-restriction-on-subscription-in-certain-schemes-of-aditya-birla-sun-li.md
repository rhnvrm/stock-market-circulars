title: Removal of Restriction on Subscription in Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund
  Schemes
---

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited has announced the removal of the maximum subscription limit of Rs. 10 crores per PAN per investor across all transactions for two of its schemes: Aditya Birla Sun Life Medium Term Plan and Aditya Birla Sun Life Credit Risk Fund. This change is effective from Monday, December 8, 2025. The restriction removal is communicated through Addendum No. 53/2025 to the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM).

## Key Points

- Maximum subscription limit of Rs. 10 crores per PAN per investor is being removed
- Applicable to two schemes: Aditya Birla Sun Life Medium Term Plan and Aditya Birla Sun Life Credit Risk Fund
- Change effective from December 8, 2025
- All other features and terms of the SID and KIM remain unchanged
- Notice dated December 4, 2025, issued from Mumbai

## Regulatory Changes

This addendum modifies the investment restrictions previously imposed on the two mutual fund schemes. The Rs. 10 crore per PAN subscription cap that was in place across all transactions has been completely removed, allowing investors to subscribe to higher amounts without any upper limit restriction.

## Compliance Requirements

- The Notice-cum-Addendum forms an integral part of the SID and KIM for the affected schemes
- Investors should read all scheme-related documents carefully
- All other terms and conditions of the schemes remain unchanged and must be complied with
- Standard mutual fund disclosure applies: "Mutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully"

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 4, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 8, 2025 (Monday)
- **Addendum Number**: 53/2025

## Impact Assessment

The removal of the Rs. 10 crore subscription cap is likely to have a positive impact on fund flows for the two affected schemes. This change primarily benefits high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) and institutional investors who were previously constrained by the investment limit. The move suggests that the fund house has gained confidence in managing larger subscription amounts in these schemes, particularly in the credit risk and medium-term debt categories. This could lead to increased Assets Under Management (AUM) for these schemes and potentially better liquidity management. The impact is scheme-specific and does not affect other schemes in the Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund family.
