- Vas Infrastructure Ltd (531574) moved to IBC Stage 1
- No securities moved to Stage 0 or between Stage I and II
- No securities excluded from ASM framework
- Consolidated list includes 13+ companies across different IBC stages

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of staged surveillance framework for companies under insolvency proceedings:
- Stage 0: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure
- Stage 1: Additional Surveillance Measure for IRP companies
- Stage 2: Enhanced surveillance measures

## Compliance Requirements
