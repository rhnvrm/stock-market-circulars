## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it represents a routine short-term funding instrument for Jindal Saw Limited. The Commercial Paper is issued on a private placement basis with a strong CARE A1+ rating, indicating high credit quality. The 90-day tenure suggests working capital requirements. The discounted issue price (Rs. 492,112.50 against face value of Rs. 500,000) implies an effective yield for investors. Trading will be restricted to institutional and high-net-worth participants given the Rs. 5 lakh minimum trading lot. No impact on equity markets or retail investors expected.
