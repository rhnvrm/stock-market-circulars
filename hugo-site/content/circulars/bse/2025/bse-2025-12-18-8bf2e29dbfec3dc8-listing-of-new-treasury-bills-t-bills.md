## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a routine administrative listing of government securities that expands the available debt instruments for trading. The addition of three T-Bills with different maturity tenors provides investors with short-term government debt options.

**Operational Impact:** Low. Trading Members need to update their systems to reflect the new scrip codes and maturity dates. The T-2 trading suspension rule is standard practice for maturing debt securities.

**Investor Impact:** Positive for debt market participants seeking government-backed short-term investment instruments with varying maturity periods (3 months, 6 months, and 12 months).
