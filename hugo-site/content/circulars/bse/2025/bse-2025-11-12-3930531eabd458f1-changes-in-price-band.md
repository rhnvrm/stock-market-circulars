title: Changes in Price Band - 34 Securities Revised Effective November 13, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the price bands for 34 securities effective November 13, 2025. The price bands have been adjusted to various levels ranging from 2% to 20% based on surveillance requirements. This is a preventive measure to control excessive volatility and protect investors in specific securities.

## Key Points

- 34 securities will have revised price bands effective November 13, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive)
- Majority of securities (17 scrips) moved to 5% price band
- 11 securities restricted to 2% price band
- 4 securities allowed 20% price band (GFL, Kalyani Investment, Nalwa Sons, Pilani Investment)
- 1 security (Supertech Ev) set at 10% price band
- Kati Patang Lifestyle Ltd has two scrip codes (531126 and 890220) both with 5% band

## Regulatory Changes

Price band is a mechanism to limit excessive volatility in securities by capping the maximum price movement allowed during a trading session. The revised bands indicate:

- **2% Band (11 scrips)**: Highly restrictive, typically for securities with elevated surveillance concerns
- **5% Band (17 scrips)**: Moderate restriction for securities requiring enhanced monitoring
- **10% Band (1 scrip)**: Standard restriction with moderate volatility allowance
- **20% Band (4 scrips)**: Normal trading band for relatively stable securities

Members can contact bse.surv@bseindia.com for clarifications.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new price bands
- All orders must comply with the revised price limits from November 13, 2025
- Risk management systems should be recalibrated for affected securities
- Investor orders exceeding the new price bands will be rejected

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: November 12, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 13, 2025 (from market opening)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities with tighter price bands (2-5%) will experience reduced intraday volatility but may face liquidity constraints. Orders placed beyond the price band limits will be rejected.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors holding or trading these securities must adjust their trading strategies. Day traders and algorithmic traders need to update their systems to account for the new price movement limits.

**Market Surveillance**: This action indicates BSE's proactive surveillance approach to protect market integrity and investor interests in securities exhibiting unusual price movements or requiring enhanced monitoring.
