## Summary

BSE has published the demat auction schedule for Settlement No. 732 dated October 10, 2025. The auction includes 97 securities from various listed companies with quantities ranging from 1 share to 30,770 shares. This auction is conducted to fulfill delivery obligations where members have failed to deliver securities in the normal settlement process.

## Key Points

- Settlement Number: 732
- Auction Date: October 10, 2025
- Total number of securities involved: 97 different scrips
- Highest quantity: SHARANAM INF (30,770 shares)
- Other significant quantities: TRIO MERCANT (21,128 shares), ASPIRA PATHL (15,842 shares), SAATVIK GREE (15,052 shares)
- Mix of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies included
- Spans multiple sectors including banking, pharmaceuticals, real estate, technology, and manufacturing

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a routine operational circular for demat auction proceedings.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members with shortages in the specified securities must participate in the auction or arrange delivery
- Members must settle their obligations as per BSE auction rules and settlement procedures
- Payment and delivery obligations must be fulfilled as per the settlement timeline

## Important Dates

- Settlement Date: October 10, 2025
- Auction execution will follow BSE's standard settlement calendar for Settlement No. 732

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction involves nearly 100 securities, indicating settlement failures across multiple scrips. While routine, large quantities in some stocks (like SHARANAM INF with 30,770 shares) could create temporary price pressure.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Affects brokers and trading members who have failed to deliver securities, requiring them to participate in the auction at potentially unfavorable prices. This serves as an enforcement mechanism to ensure settlement discipline.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Individual investors are generally not directly affected unless their broker has failed to deliver their securities. The auction mechanism ensures final settlement occurs even when normal delivery fails.
