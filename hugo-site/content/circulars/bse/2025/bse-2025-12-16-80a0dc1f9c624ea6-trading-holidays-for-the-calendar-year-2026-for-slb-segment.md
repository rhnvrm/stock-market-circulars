## Impact Assessment

**Market Operations:** The holiday schedule affects SLB segment trading and settlement cycles throughout 2026. Trading members need to factor these holidays into their operational planning, margin requirements, and client communications.

**Participant Impact:** Medium impact on SLB segment participants who must adjust their securities lending and borrowing strategies around these non-trading days. The concentration of holidays in certain months (March, April, October, November) may require additional planning.

**Special Consideration:** The Muhurat trading session on November 8, 2026 (Sunday) represents a special trading opportunity, with detailed timings to be announced later. This is traditionally an auspicious trading session during Diwali celebrations.

**Flexibility:** BSE retains the right to modify the holiday schedule with advance notice, requiring members to monitor circulars for any updates throughout the year.
