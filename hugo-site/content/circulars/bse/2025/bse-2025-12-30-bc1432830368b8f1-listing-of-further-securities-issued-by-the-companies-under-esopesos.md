## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard administrative notification for listing of employee stock options.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements for market participants. This is an informational circular regarding securities that have been approved for listing and trading.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 30, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: December 31, 2025 (Wednesday)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine corporate action that represents employee compensation being converted to tradeable securities. The volumes involved are relatively small compared to the outstanding shares of these companies.

**Company-Specific Impact**: 
- Represents increased float for listed companies
- Potential dilution effect is marginal given the small number of shares relative to existing equity base
- No lock-in restrictions means shares are immediately tradeable

**Investor Impact**: Neutral. Existing shareholders may see minor dilution, but the impact is negligible given the small size of issuances relative to market capitalization of these companies.
