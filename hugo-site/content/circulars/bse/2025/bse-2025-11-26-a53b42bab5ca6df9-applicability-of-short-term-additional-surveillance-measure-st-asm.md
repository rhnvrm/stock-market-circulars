## Surveillance Framework Details

**ST-ASM Framework Purpose**: Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure is applied to securities showing abnormal price movements or volatility to protect investor interests.

**Movement to Other Frameworks**:
- Securities marked with (*) move to Long Term ASM (LT-ASM) Framework
- Securities marked with (#) move to Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) Framework
- Securities marked with ($) move to Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework
- Securities marked with (**) move to Trade for Trade Framework
- Securities marked with (^) move to Pledge Framework

**Special Categories**:
- Securities marked with (@) are SME scrips
- Securities marked with (~) are T+0 scrips under ST-ASM based on parent company

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised surveillance status of affected securities
- Trading in securities under ST-ASM is subject to specific surveillance conditions and margin requirements
- Investors should be aware that securities under ASM framework may have reduced liquidity
- Brokers must ensure compliance with surveillance framework requirements for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 27, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of 3 securities and removal of 11 securities from ST-ASM indicates ongoing monitoring of market volatility and price movements. The net reduction in ST-ASM securities suggests improved stability in some counters.

**Trading Impact**: Securities entering ST-ASM will face stricter surveillance, potentially affecting liquidity and requiring higher margins. Securities exiting the framework will see relaxation of surveillance measures, though some are moving to other surveillance frameworks.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding securities newly added to ST-ASM should expect potential trading restrictions and higher margin requirements. Those holding securities exiting ST-ASM may see improved liquidity unless the security moves to another restrictive framework.

**SME Segment**: Multiple SME scrips are affected, with some entering and others exiting the framework, reflecting the exchange's focused surveillance on smaller companies.
