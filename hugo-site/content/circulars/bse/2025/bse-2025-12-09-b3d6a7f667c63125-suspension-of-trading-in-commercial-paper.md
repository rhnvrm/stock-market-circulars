## Impact Assessment

The suspension affects holders and traders of these 16 commercial papers who will be unable to trade these instruments during the specified no-dealings period. This is a routine corporate action with limited broader market impact. Investors holding these instruments should note the redemption schedule. The concentration of 14 redemptions on December 12, 2025 indicates a common maturity cycle but does not signal systemic concerns.
