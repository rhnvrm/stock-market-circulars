## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is a routine listing of short-term debt instruments by a large, highly-rated corporate issuer. The commercial papers provide short-term funding options for Reliance Industries and investment opportunities for debt market participants. The high credit ratings (A1+ from both CARE and CRISIL) indicate low credit risk. This listing only affects participants in the BSE debt segment and does not impact equity markets or broader trading operations.
