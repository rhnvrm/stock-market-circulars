## Summary

BSE has updated the list of securities under the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective November 13, 2025. One security (Thangamayil Jewellery Ltd) has been newly shortlisted for LT-ASM, while two securities (Ashnisha Industries Ltd and Shahi Shipping Ltd) are moving out of the framework due to inclusion in other surveillance frameworks.

## Key Points

- Thangamayil Jewellery Ltd (Scrip Code: 533158, ISIN: INE085J01014) newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework
- No securities are moving to higher or lower ASM stages within the LT-ASM framework
- No securities are being shortlisted for Direct Stage IV under LT-ASM
- Two securities exiting LT-ASM: Ashnisha Industries Ltd (moved to ESM) and Shahi Shipping Ltd (moved to GSM)
- A consolidated list of securities in various ASM stages is provided, showing multiple companies in Stage I and Stage IV

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM Framework continues to identify securities with concerns regarding price movements and will subject them to enhanced surveillance measures including:
- Price bands and trading restrictions
- Additional margin requirements
- Possible trade-for-trade settlement
- Enhanced disclosure requirements

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of securities under LT-ASM and associated trading restrictions
- Securities in LT-ASM framework are subject to special surveillance parameters
- Traders must comply with additional margin requirements and settlement conditions for affected securities
- Investors should exercise caution when trading in securities under surveillance frameworks

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 13, 2025 - Changes to LT-ASM Framework take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of one security and removal of two securities represents minimal disruption to the overall market. The LT-ASM framework serves as a preventive measure to protect investor interests.

**Trading Impact**: Thangamayil Jewellery Ltd will face enhanced surveillance measures including potential price bands, higher margins, and increased scrutiny of trades. This may reduce liquidity and trading volumes in the affected security.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading in Thangamayil Jewellery Ltd should be prepared for trading restrictions and increased margin requirements. The surveillance measure signals regulatory concern about the security's price movements and trading patterns.
