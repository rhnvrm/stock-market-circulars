## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this is a routine listing of rights issue shares for a single company. The partly paid-up nature means shareholders will need to pay the remaining Rs. 60.50/- per share on future calls as determined by the Board. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new scrip details and suspended temporary ISIN. The 'X' Group classification indicates specific trading parameters apply to these securities.
