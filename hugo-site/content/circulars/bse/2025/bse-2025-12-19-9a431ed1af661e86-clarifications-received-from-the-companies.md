## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. These are routine clarifications confirming no undisclosed material information exists. The circulars provide transparency but do not reveal new information that would affect trading decisions.

**Operational Impact**: No operational changes required. Companies confirmed existing compliance processes are functioning properly.

**Investor Impact**: Low. Investors are informed that recent price movements in these securities are market-driven rather than based on undisclosed company-specific developments. This provides reassurance about disclosure compliance but offers no new fundamental information about the companies.
