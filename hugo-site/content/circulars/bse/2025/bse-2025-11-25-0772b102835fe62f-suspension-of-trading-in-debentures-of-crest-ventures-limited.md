## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Complete trading halt affects liquidity for holders of this debenture series. Investors will be unable to buy or sell these securities from the suspension date.

**Investor Impact**: High - Debenture holders identified as of the record date will receive final interest payment and principal redemption. No secondary market exit available after suspension.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members must update their systems to block trades in this ISIN and communicate with affected clients.

**Financial Impact**: The redemption provides exit for investors through maturity rather than secondary market trading. Interest payment provides final coupon before redemption.
