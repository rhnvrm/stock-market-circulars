**Trading Member Impact:** Trading members need to adjust their operational schedules, staffing, and risk management processes to account for the partial and full trading closures throughout 2026.

**Investor Impact:** Investors in commodity derivatives and EGR products should be aware of reduced trading days and plan their investment activities accordingly. The evening session closures on partial holidays may affect strategies dependent on extended trading hours.

**Planning Advantage:** Advance notification enables better planning for market participants, allowing them to structure their trading and operational calendars well in advance for the entire year 2026.
