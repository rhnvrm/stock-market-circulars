## Impact Assessment

This revision primarily affects institutional traders operating in the SME segment of BSE's ITP platform. The modified settlement timings for four specific dates (September 4, 5, 8, and 9) require operational adjustments from members to accommodate extended pay-in and pay-out schedules. The changes appear designed to manage settlement efficiency during specific market conditions in early September 2025.
