**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a scheduled operational matter affecting specific mutual fund schemes.

**Investor Impact:** Low. Investors in the affected schemes will not be able to place purchase, redemption, or switch orders on the specified non-business days. Planning transactions around these dates will avoid any inconvenience.

**Operational Impact:** The non-business days primarily align with holidays in the underlying international markets (US Thanksgiving on November 27, Japanese holidays in early November, Veterans Day on November 11), which is standard practice for international funds that cannot operate when their target markets are closed.
