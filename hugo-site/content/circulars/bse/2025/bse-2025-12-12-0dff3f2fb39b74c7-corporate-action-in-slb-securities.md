## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium impact on SLB market participants holding positions in these two securities. The shut periods will temporarily restrict lending and borrowing activities.

**Operational Impact:** Participants must plan position closures ahead of shut periods. The dividend action for Can Fin Homes requires coordination for benefit entitlements, while the stock split for Nuvama Wealth requires position adjustments.

**Investor Impact:** Investors engaged in securities lending must ensure positions are squared off or rolled over before foreclosure dates to avoid forced closures during shut periods.
