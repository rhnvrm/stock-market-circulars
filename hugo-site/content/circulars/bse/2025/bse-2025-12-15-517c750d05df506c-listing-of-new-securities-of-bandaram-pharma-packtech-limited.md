## Impact Assessment

The listing represents a capital raise through preferential allotment for BANDARAM PHARMA PACKTECH LIMITED. With approximately 59.72 lakh new shares entering the market (subject to lock-in), this will increase the company's equity base. The staggered lock-in periods (2026 and 2027) will delay the free float of these shares. Market impact is expected to be minimal as shares are locked-in and the issuance is company-specific. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new share capital and lock-in details.
