The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for redemption of these debentures. Trading members are advised not to deal in these securities from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- No dealings permitted from: December 16, 2025
- Circular Reference: DR-778/2025-2026
- Issuer: Muthoottu Mini Financiers Limited

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debenture series (INE101Q07AO2) from December 16, 2025 onwards
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the trading suspension
- No buy or sell orders should be accepted for this security after the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 11, 2025
- **Record Date**: December 16, 2025
- **Trading Suspension Date**: December 16, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of this specific debenture series of Muthoottu Mini Financiers Limited. As this is a private placement debenture (indicated by 'PVT' suffix), the investor base is likely restricted and trading volumes minimal. The suspension is a procedural requirement for redemption and does not indicate any financial distress or irregularity. Market-wide impact is negligible as this affects only one debt security of a single entity.
