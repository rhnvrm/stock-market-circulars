## Impact Assessment

This auction provides retail and institutional investors an opportunity to participate in government securities investment through the non-competitive route without needing to quote yields. The inclusion of a long-dated security (7.24% GS 2055) and a sovereign green bond (6.98% GOI SGrB 2054) offers diversification options. The ₹32,000 crore size indicates significant government borrowing requirements. The non-competitive facility democratizes access to G-sec auctions for smaller investors who can invest between ₹10,000 to ₹2 crores per security.
