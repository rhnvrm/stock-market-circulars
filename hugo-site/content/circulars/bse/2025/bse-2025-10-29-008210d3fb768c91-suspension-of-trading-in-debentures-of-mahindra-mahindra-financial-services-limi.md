The suspension is due to the company fixing the record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest.

## Key Points

- Trading suspended for MMFSL debenture series MMFSL-8.10%-21-11-25-PVT
- ISIN: INE774D07UQ7, BSE Code: 974373
- Record date set for November 6, 2025
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Trading members advised not to deal in these debentures from November 6, 2025
- Notice issued under reference DR-750/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action procedure for debenture redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease dealing in the specified MMFSL debentures from November 6, 2025
- Trading members are required to take note of the suspension and ensure compliance
- No transactions should be executed in the affected debenture series from the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **October 29, 2025**: Notice date and circular issuance
- **November 6, 2025**: Record date for debenture redemption and interest payment
- **November 6, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date (no dealings from this date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders and traders of the specific MMFSL debenture series. The 8.10% coupon debentures issued in 2021 with November 2025 maturity are approaching their redemption date, which is a planned corporate action. No systemic market impact expected.

**Operational Impact**: Debenture holders will receive their final interest payment and principal redemption as per the original terms. Trading members must update their systems to prevent inadvertent trading in the suspended security. The suspension protects market integrity by preventing trades after the record date when entitlements have been determined.
