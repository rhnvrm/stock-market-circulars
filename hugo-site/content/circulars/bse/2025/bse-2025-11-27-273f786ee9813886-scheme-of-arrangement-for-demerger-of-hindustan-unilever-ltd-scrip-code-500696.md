- HUL will be part of Call Auction in Pre-open Session (Special Pre-open Session - SPOS) on December 5, 2025, as per SEBI Circular No. CIR/MRD/DP/01/2012 dated January 20, 2012

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: December 5, 2025 - For determining entitlement of shareholders for the demerger
- **Ex-Entitlement Date**: December 5, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-771/2025-2026)
- **Special Pre-open Session (SPOS)**: December 5, 2025 - HUL will trade under call auction
- **Notice Date**: November 27, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - This demerger affects one of India's largest FMCG companies. All HUL shareholders will receive shares in the newly listed entity Kwality Wall's (India) Limited, potentially creating significant trading activity in both stocks.

**Shareholder Impact**: High - Every HUL shareholder will automatically receive equal number of shares in Kwality Wall's (India) Limited, doubling their portfolio holdings across two separate entities.

**Trading Impact**: The mandatory SPOS on December 5, 2025 will result in price discovery through call auction mechanism rather than normal continuous trading, which may lead to volatility.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members and depositories need to process the corporate action, credit new shares, and facilitate listing of the resulting company.

**Strategic Impact**: This represents HUL's strategic decision to separate its ice cream business into a focused entity, potentially unlocking shareholder value and allowing independent growth strategies for both businesses.
