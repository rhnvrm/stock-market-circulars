**Operational Impact:** SLB participants need to plan their positions considering the foreclosure dates. During shut periods, no SLB transactions will be possible in these securities, potentially affecting hedging and arbitrage strategies.

**Trading Impact:** The stock split for MCX will require adjustment of futures and options contracts and SLB positions. Dividend announcements for TCS and CAMS will affect cost-of-carry calculations for SLB positions.
