## Summary

BSE has approved the listing of 10,00,000 equity shares of Madhuveer Com 18 Network Limited (Scrip Code: 531910) issued to promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to conversion of warrants. The new shares will be listed and permitted to trade with effect from Wednesday, December 10, 2025. These shares are ranking pari-passu with existing equity shares and are subject to a lock-in period until October 31, 2027.

## Key Points

- 10,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each issued at a premium of Rs. 30/-
- Issue price: Rs. 40/- per share
- Allotment made to promoters on preferential basis pursuant to warrant conversion
- Date of allotment: August 11, 2025
- Trading commencement: December 10, 2025
- Distinctive numbers: 26502901 to 27502900
- ISIN: INE312M01016
- New shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for preferential allotment shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities listing
- All 10,00,000 shares are subject to lock-in restrictions until October 31, 2027
- Shares issued pursuant to warrant conversion under SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment**: August 11, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: December 10, 2025
- **Lock-in Period End**: October 31, 2027
- **Notice Date**: December 9, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The issuance represents a relatively small number of shares (10 lakh) allocated exclusively to promoters on a preferential basis. The shares are subject to a lock-in period of approximately 2 years, preventing immediate trading by promoters.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible immediate impact on trading liquidity as all shares are locked-in until October 2027.

**Corporate Impact**: Represents successful conversion of warrants previously issued to promoters, likely strengthening the company's capital base by Rs. 40 lakh (10,00,000 shares × Rs. 40 per share).

**Investor Consideration**: The preferential allotment at Rs. 40/- per share (Rs. 30/- premium over face value) increases promoter stake and demonstrates promoter commitment through warrant conversion.
