---

## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in two series of non-convertible debentures issued by DAR Credit & Capital Limited effective November 25, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for early redemption of these NCDs. Trading members are advised not to deal in these securities from the no-dealings date.

## Key Points

- Two NCD series affected: DCCL-12.25%-10-2-26-PVT (ISIN: INE04Q907066) and DCCL-NIFTY-10-2-26-PVT (ISIN: INE04Q907082)
- Record date for early redemption: November 25, 2025
- No dealings permitted from: November 25, 2025
- Notice reference: DR-763/2025-2026
- Both securities are privately placed debentures

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a routine corporate action affecting specific debt securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from November 25, 2025
- Members should update their trading systems to reflect the suspension
- Ensure client communications regarding the suspension of these securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: November 17, 2025
- **Record Date**: November 25, 2025
- **No Dealings From**: November 25, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of these two specific privately placed NCD series. Early redemption provides liquidity to debenture holders. Trading suspension is a standard procedure for corporate actions and affects only these particular debt instruments. No broader market impact expected.
