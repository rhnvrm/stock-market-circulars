## Impact Assessment

This is a routine preferential allotment to promoters with minimal market impact. The complete lock-in on all shares until June 30, 2027 means these shares will not be available for trading despite being listed. The listing increases the total outstanding shares of Ramchandra Leasing & Finance Limited but does not affect immediate tradable float due to lock-in restrictions.
