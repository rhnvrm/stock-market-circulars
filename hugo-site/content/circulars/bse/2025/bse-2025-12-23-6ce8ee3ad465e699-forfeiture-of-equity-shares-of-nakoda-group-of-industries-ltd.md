## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact:** High - Multiple shareholders holding varying quantities of shares (from 1 to 4,531 shares) will lose their shareholding through forfeiture. This typically occurs due to non-payment of call money or other statutory defaults.

**Company Impact:** The forfeiture will reduce the company's paid-up capital and alter its shareholding pattern. The company may reissue these forfeited shares as per applicable law.

**Market Impact:** Limited direct market impact, but signals potential compliance or financial issues that led to forfeiture proceedings. Investors should exercise caution and investigate the reasons for forfeiture before investing in the company.
