## Impact Assessment

This corporate action has minimal market-wide impact as it affects only specific debentures of a private limited company. Debenture holders will receive partial redemption proceeds and interest payments. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the reduced face values from the effective dates. The action represents normal debt servicing activity with no broader implications for market operations or other securities.
