## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Rishab Special Yarns Limited Shareholders**: This mandatory open offer represents a significant corporate action involving change in control and management of the company. Public shareholders have an exit opportunity at ₹13.00 per share with interest component. The acquisition of 26% voting capital by the acquirers and PAC will result in substantial ownership restructuring. Shareholders should evaluate the offer price against market price and company fundamentals before deciding to tender their shares. The unconditional nature of the offer (not dependent on minimum acceptance) provides certainty of execution. The interest component from FY 2022-2023 indicates this may be related to a prior transaction or arrangement that is now being formalized through this takeover offer.
