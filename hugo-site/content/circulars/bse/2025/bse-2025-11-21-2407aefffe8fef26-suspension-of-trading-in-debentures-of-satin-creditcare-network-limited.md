Trading members are strictly advised not to deal in the specified debenture series.

## Key Points

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must immediately cease all trading activities in the specified debenture series (INE836B07675)
- No buy or sell orders to be accepted for this debenture from November 26, 2025
- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the trading suspension
- Members must inform clients holding or interested in these debentures about the suspension

## Important Dates

- **November 21, 2025**: Circular issued by BSE
- **November 26, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment; trading suspension effective from this date
- **December 12, 2027**: Debenture maturity date (as per series nomenclature)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High impact on holders of this specific debenture series. Investors holding these debentures will be unable to trade them from the suspension date. Those eligible as per the record date will receive interest payment and can exercise their PUT option for redemption.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must immediately update their systems and client communications. The suspension affects liquidity for this debt instrument and requires prompt action from trading desks handling debt securities.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders with PUT options must have made their decision before the record date. Post-suspension, secondary market exit is not possible, making the PUT option exercise critical for investors seeking early redemption.
