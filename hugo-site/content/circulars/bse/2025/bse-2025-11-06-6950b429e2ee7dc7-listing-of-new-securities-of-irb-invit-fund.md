The new units will commence trading on November 7, 2025, and rank pari-passu with existing units. The allotment was completed on November 3, 2025.

## Key Points

- Total new units listed: 15,96,95,000 units
- Issue price: Rs. 62.95 per unit
- Allotment date: November 3, 2025
- Trading commencement: November 7, 2025
- Scrip Code: 540526
- ISIN: INE183W23014
- Distribution Numbers: 1121905001 to 1281600000
- Units rank pari-passu with existing units

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification following preferential allotment procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities listing
- Lock-in restrictions apply to the allotted units as specified
- Units must be traded in accordance with BSE regulations and the specified lock-in periods

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date:** November 3, 2025
- **Trading Commencement:** November 7, 2025
- **Lock-in Period 1:** 1,79,54,250 units (Dist. Nos. 1121905001 to 1139859250) locked until November 6, 2028
- **Lock-in Period 2:** 14,17,40,750 units (Dist. Nos. 1139859251 to 1281600000) locked until November 5, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The preferential issue represents a significant increase in IRB InvIT Fund's unit capital. With approximately 11.2% of units locked until November 2028 and 88.8% locked until November 2026, immediate market liquidity impact will be limited. The units trading from November 7, 2025, will expand the tradeable float after lock-in periods expire.

**Investor Impact:** Existing unitholders should note the dilution from the preferential issue. The Rs. 62.95 issue price will serve as a reference point for valuation. The staggered lock-in periods suggest different investor categories with varying commitment levels.

**Operational Impact:** The listing expands IRB InvIT Fund's capital base, potentially providing additional resources for infrastructure investments or debt servicing. The preferential route suggests strategic capital raising from identified sponsors and investors.
