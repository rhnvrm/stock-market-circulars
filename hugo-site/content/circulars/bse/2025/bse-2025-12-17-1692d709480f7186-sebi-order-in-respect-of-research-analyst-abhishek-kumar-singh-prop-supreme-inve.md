## Impact Assessment

This enforcement action demonstrates SEBI's continued vigilance in monitoring registered Research Analysts and ensuring compliance with regulations designed to protect investors. The violations identified—particularly promising assured returns and profit-sharing fee arrangements—are serious breaches that undermine investor protection principles.

While this action is specific to one Research Analyst, it serves as a reminder to all registered RAs about the importance of:
- Maintaining ethical standards in client interactions
- Avoiding guaranteed return promises
- Proper risk disclosure
- Transparent and compliant fee structures

Investors dealing with research analysts should be wary of any promises of assured returns or profit-sharing arrangements, as these are clear red flags of non-compliant practices. The market impact is limited to clients of this specific RA, but the precedent reinforces regulatory standards across the industry.
