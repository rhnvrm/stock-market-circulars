## Impact Assessment

The ST-ASM framework imposes additional surveillance measures on selected securities, which may include higher margins, restricted trading, or enhanced monitoring. Securities moving into the framework will face increased regulatory scrutiny, while those moving out may experience relaxed trading conditions. The transition of some securities to other frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM) indicates continued regulatory oversight through different mechanisms.
