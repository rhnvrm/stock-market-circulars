title: Revision of Price Bands for 60 Securities Effective November 3, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 60 securities effective from November 3, 2025. The revised bands range from 2% to 20%, down from their previous levels. This surveillance measure restricts the maximum price movement allowed in a single trading session for these securities. The changes indicate increased monitoring due to concerns about volatility or market manipulation in these stocks.

## Key Points

- Price bands revised for 60 securities effective November 3, 2025
- Revised bands range from 2% (tightest) to 20% (widest)
- Most securities (35 stocks) receive 5% price band
- 13 securities receive 10% band, 9 receive 20% band, and 3 receive 2% band
- Tightest restrictions (2% band): Amit Securities Ltd and Cubical Financial Services Ltd
- Members should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com for clarifications
- Notice issued by BSE Surveillance department

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This is an application of existing surveillance powers by BSE to adjust price bands based on market conditions and security-specific factors.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands in their systems before November 3, 2025
- All trades in affected securities must respect new price band limits
- Orders exceeding the revised price bands will be rejected by the trading system
- Members should inform their clients about the revised trading limits for these securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 31, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 3, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Significant restrictions on intraday price movements for 60 securities. Traders will face limited profit potential per session and may need multiple sessions to build or exit positions.

**Liquidity Impact**: Tighter bands may reduce trading volumes as price discovery is constrained. Market makers and arbitrageurs may find these securities less attractive.

**Investor Impact**: Long-term investors largely unaffected, but short-term traders and day traders will face material constraints. The 2% band on Amit Securities and Cubical Financial Services is particularly restrictive.

**Market Signal**: Price band revisions typically signal exchange concerns about excessive volatility, low liquidity, or potential manipulation, indicating higher risk profiles for these securities.
