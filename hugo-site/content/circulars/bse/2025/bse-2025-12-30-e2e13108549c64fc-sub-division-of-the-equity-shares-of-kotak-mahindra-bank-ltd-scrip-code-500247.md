## Summary

Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd (Scrip Code: 500247) has announced a sub-division (stock split) of its equity shares with a record date of January 14, 2026. Each existing equity share with face value of Rs. 5/- will be subdivided into five equity shares of Re. 1/- each. The existing ISIN INE237A01028 will become invalid for transactions on or after the record date, and a new ISIN for Re. 1/- paid up shares will be announced separately.

## Key Points

- Company: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd (Scrip Code: 500247)
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares (stock split)
- Subdivision Ratio: 1:5 (One share of Rs. 5/- split into five shares of Re. 1/- each)
- Segment: Equity - Dematerialised Securities (Rolling Settlement)
- Notice Number: DR-798/2025-2026
- Issued by: Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Compliance & Operations

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN No. INE237A01028 (for Rs. 5/- paid up shares) will not be valid for transactions done on the Exchange on or after January 14, 2026. A new ISIN number for Re. 1/- paid up shares will be communicated to the market through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members of the Exchange must note the record date and ensure proper handling of trades
- All transactions on or after January 14, 2026 must use the new ISIN (to be announced)
- Shareholders need not take any action as the subdivision will be processed automatically in demat accounts

## Important Dates

- **Record Date:** January 14, 2026
- **Effective Date for Subdivided Shares:** January 14, 2026
- **Old ISIN Validity:** Valid until January 13, 2026 (last day)
- **New ISIN Effective:** January 14, 2026 onwards
- **Notice Date:** December 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - This stock split will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the face value proportionally. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors due to lower per-share price.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and investors must be aware of the ISIN change. All existing holdings will be automatically credited with subdivided shares in the ratio of 1:5. The market lot size and trading parameters may be adjusted accordingly.

**Shareholder Impact:** Existing shareholders will receive five shares for every one share held as of the record date. The total value of holdings remains unchanged, but share count increases proportionally.
