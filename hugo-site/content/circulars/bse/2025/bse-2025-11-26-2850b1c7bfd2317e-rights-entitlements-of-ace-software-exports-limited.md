## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains only to ACE Software Exports Limited and its shareholders. Existing shareholders receive tradable rights entitlements allowing them to subscribe to additional shares or sell their entitlement rights in the market. The 13-day renunciation period and 18-day subscription period provide adequate time for investor decision-making. Trading members need to ensure proper client communication and contract note disclaimers to maintain transparency.
