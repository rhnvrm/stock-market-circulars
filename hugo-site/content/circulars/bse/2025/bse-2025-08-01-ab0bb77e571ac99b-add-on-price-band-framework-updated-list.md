## Key Points

- Updated list includes 31 securities with their scrip codes and ISIN numbers
- Companies span across multiple sectors including infrastructure, hospitality, exports, and manufacturing
- Framework applies additional price band restrictions beyond normal trading bands
- List includes both small and mid-cap companies

## Regulatory Changes

This represents an updated compilation of securities under the existing Add-on Price Band Framework rather than new regulatory changes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must apply appropriate price band restrictions for listed securities
- Enhanced monitoring and surveillance applies to these securities
- Traders and investors should be aware of additional price movement limitations

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: August 1, 2025
