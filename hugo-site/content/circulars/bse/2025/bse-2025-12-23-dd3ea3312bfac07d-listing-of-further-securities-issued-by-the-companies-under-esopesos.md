## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should update their systems with new share counts and distinctive numbers
- No special compliance actions required from investors or brokers

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** December 23, 2025
- **Listing & Trading Start Date:** December 24, 2025 (Wednesday)
- **Lock-in Expiry:** Not applicable (no lock-in period)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The newly listed shares represent ESOP/ESOS allotments which are typically small relative to the total outstanding shares of the respective companies. For example, ICICI Bank's 19,752 shares is negligible compared to its massive equity base.

**Liquidity Impact:** Neutral to slightly positive. Additional shares increase overall float, though the quantities are small.

**Stock-Specific Impact:** 
- **Vascon Engineers:** Largest absolute increase (2.38 million shares, ~1% dilution based on typical capital structure)
- **Aditya Birla Capital:** Significant ESOP allotment (1.37 million shares) reflecting employee participation
- **Coforge, Uno Minda:** Moderate issuances indicating ongoing employee compensation programs

**Investor Impact:** No material impact on existing shareholders. ESOP dilution is typically anticipated and factored into valuations. No lock-in restrictions mean immediate liquidity for option holders.
