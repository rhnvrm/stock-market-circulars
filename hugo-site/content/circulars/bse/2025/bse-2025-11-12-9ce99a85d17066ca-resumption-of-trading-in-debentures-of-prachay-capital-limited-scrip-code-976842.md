## Summary

BSE has announced the resumption of trading in three debenture series of Prachay Capital Limited (Scrip Codes: 976842, 976849, and 976850) effective November 13, 2025. Trading was previously suspended to facilitate the exercise of put options by debenture holders. As the put options were not exercised, normal trading will resume.

## Key Points

- Trading to resume in three debenture series (Scrip Codes: 976842, 976849, 976850)
- Put options were not exercised by debenture holders
- Previous record dates were set for October 24, September 19, and October 9, 2025
- The record dates were for payment of interest and early redemption on exercise of put option
- Circular reference: DR-755/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational update regarding the resumption of trading following the completion of a put option exercise period.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members should note the availability of the debentures for trading
- No specific compliance actions required from market participants

## Important Dates

- **November 13, 2025**: Trading resumes for all three debenture series
- **Previous Record Dates**: October 24, 2025, September 19, 2025, and October 9, 2025 (for interest payment and put option exercise)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a procedural matter affecting specific debt securities of Prachay Capital Limited. The non-exercise of put options indicates debenture holders chose to retain their holdings. Trading resumption restores normal market liquidity for these instruments. Impact is limited to existing debenture holders and potential investors in these specific securities.
