## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to privately placed debt securities in the institutional segment. The zero-coupon structure means investors receive returns through the discount between issue price (Rs. 51,780) and face value (Rs. 100,000) at maturity. The triple-A ratings from three major agencies indicate high credit quality. Impact is limited to debt market participants and institutional investors dealing with IRFC securities.
