**Market Impact:** Minimal. The total number of shares being listed (391,429) represents a small fraction of the outstanding shares for these companies. The largest listing is AXIS Bank with 164,286 shares, which is negligible compared to its total outstanding shares.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible increase in float for the affected companies. These securities are freely tradable with no lock-in restrictions.

**Dilution Impact:** Minor dilution for existing shareholders as these represent employee stock option exercises that were already accounted for in the companies' outstanding ESOP/ESOS pools.

**Investor Impact:** No direct impact on investors. These are routine corporate actions related to employee compensation and do not affect fundamental valuations or operations.
