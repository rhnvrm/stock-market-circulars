## Summary

BSE has issued a notice prohibiting dealings in partly paid equity shares (Scrip Code 890215) of Garment Mantra Lifestyle Limited effective October 31, 2025. The suspension is to facilitate determination of eligible partly paid shareholders who will receive notice for the Second and Final Call payment of the company's Rights Issue.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies only to partly paid equity shares (Scrip Code 890215)
- Record Date: October 31, 2025
- No dealings from: October 31, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-747/2025-2026)
- Second and Final Call Money: Rs. 0.60 per partly paid equity share
- Call money breakdown: Rs. 0.50 towards Face Value + Rs. 0.10 as Premium
- Notice issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President – Listing Operations (CRD)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard administrative action for rights issue call payment processing.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must not execute any trades in partly paid equity shares of Garment Mantra Lifestyle Limited (Scrip Code 890215) from October 31, 2025
- Trading Members are required to take note of this restriction and inform their clients accordingly
- Only applies to partly paid shares; regular equity shares (if any) are not affected

## Important Dates

- **October 27, 2025**: Notice issued
- **October 31, 2025**: Record Date to determine eligible partly paid shareholders
- **October 31, 2025**: No dealings commence (Settlement DR-747/2025-2026)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The restriction affects only partly paid equity shares of a single company, not the broader market.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems block trades in the specified scrip code. Shareholders of partly paid shares need to be prepared to pay the Second and Final Call money of Rs. 0.60 per share.

**Investor Impact**: Affects only existing holders of partly paid equity shares who participated in the rights issue. They will receive notice regarding payment of the final call amount totaling Rs. 0.60 per share to complete their equity ownership.
