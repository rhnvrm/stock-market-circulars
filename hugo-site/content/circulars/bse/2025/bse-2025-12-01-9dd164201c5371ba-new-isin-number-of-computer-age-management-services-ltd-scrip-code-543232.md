## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN INE596I01020 for all trades in CAMS equity shares from the ex-date onwards
- All market participants should update their systems and records to reflect the new ISIN

## Important Dates

- Notice Date: December 1, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** All trades executed on or after December 5, 2025 will be settled using the new ISIN with adjusted face value of Rs.2/-. Market participants must ensure their trading systems are updated to prevent settlement failures.

**Liquidity Impact:** Stock splits typically improve liquidity by reducing the price per share, making it more accessible to retail investors. The 1:5 split will reduce the absolute share price to one-fifth of the pre-split price.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers, custodians, and investors must update their records and systems to reflect the new ISIN. Failure to do so may result in reconciliation issues and trading disruptions.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares for every 1 share held, with proportionate adjustment in share price. Total investment value remains unchanged.
