The equity shares have been consolidated from face value of Rs.5 fully paid-up to Rs.10 fully paid-up, with a new ISIN number INE363L01045. Trading members are advised to exercise caution while quoting rates due to the face value change.

- Market lot: 1 (One) share

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements a corporate action (share consolidation) as per existing regulations governing changes in share capital structure.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must update systems with new ISIN (INE363L01045) effective November 17, 2025
- **Trading Members**: Exercise abundant caution while entering rates for equity shares due to consolidated face value
- **Market Participants**: Use only the new ISIN for all transactions on or after November 17, 2025
- **Shareholders**: Existing shares will be consolidated in the ratio of 2:1 (Rs.5 shares to Rs.10 shares)

## Important Dates

- **November 11, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **November 17, 2025**: Trading resumption date with consolidated shares
- **November 17, 2025**: New ISIN becomes effective for transactions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Trading resumption after consolidation requires system updates and trader awareness. The 2:1 consolidation (Rs.5 to Rs.10) means shareholders will hold half the number of shares but at double the face value, maintaining overall equity value.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN and face value. Price discovery may require additional attention initially as market participants adjust to the new face value.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders of Synthiko Foils Ltd will see their shareholding consolidated, with potential impact on odd-lot holdings. The market lot of 1 share provides flexibility for trading.

**Risk Factors**: Trading members are specifically cautioned to verify rates carefully to avoid errors in pricing due to the face value change from Rs.5 to Rs.10.
