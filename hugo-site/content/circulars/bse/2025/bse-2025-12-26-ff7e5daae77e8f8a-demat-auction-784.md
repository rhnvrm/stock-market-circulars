## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 105 scrips across multiple sectors. While routine in nature, high quantities in certain scrips (Excel Realty, Shyamkamal, Modi Rubber) may impact those specific securities.

**Broker Impact:** Medium - Brokers with clients who failed to deliver shares must procure shares through auction, potentially at premium prices, leading to financial losses.

**Investor Impact:** Medium - Sellers who failed to deliver will face auction consequences and potential penalties. Buyers awaiting delivery will receive shares through the auction mechanism.

**Operational Impact:** Standard settlement procedure to ensure delivery obligations are met and market integrity is maintained.
