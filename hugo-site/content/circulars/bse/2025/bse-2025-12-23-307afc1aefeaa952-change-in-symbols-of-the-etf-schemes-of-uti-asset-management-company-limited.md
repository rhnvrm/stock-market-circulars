- Investors should be aware of symbol changes for order placement and portfolio tracking
- No action required from existing ETF holders as scrip codes and ISINs remain unchanged

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 23, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 24, 2025 - New symbols become active for trading

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Symbol changes affect all 11 UTI ETF schemes covering major market segments including large-cap equity indices, sectoral indices, government securities, and commodities. Trading continuity will be maintained as only symbols change while scrip codes remain the same.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants need to update their systems, algorithms, and reference databases to reflect new symbols. The short notice period (1 day) requires immediate action from market infrastructure providers and trading desks.

**Investor Impact**: Minimal direct impact on investors as holdings and ISINs remain unchanged. Investors need to use new symbols for placing orders from December 24, 2025 onwards. Portfolio tracking systems may require updates to reflect new symbols.
