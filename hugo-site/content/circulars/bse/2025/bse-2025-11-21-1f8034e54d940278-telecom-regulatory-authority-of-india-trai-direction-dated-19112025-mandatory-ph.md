title: 'TRAI Direction: Mandatory Phase-wise Adoption of 1600-Series Numbers for BFSI
  Entities'
---

## Summary

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a Direction dated November 19, 2025, under section 13 of the TRAI Act, 1997, mandating phase-wise implementation of 1600-series numbers by entities regulated by RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA. This directive aims to curb promotional calls disguised as service and transactional calls, which often result in spam and potential scams. The 1600-series numbering was allocated by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on December 23, 2024, exclusively for Government entities and BFSI sector entities for Service and Transactional Voice Calls.

## Key Points

- TRAI has made it mandatory for RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA regulated entities to adopt 1600-series numbers for service and transactional voice calls
- The directive is issued under section 13, read with section 11(1)(b)(i) and (v) of the TRAI Act, 1997
- DoT allocated the 1600-series exclusively for Government and BFSI entities on December 23, 2024
- TRAI directed Access Providers to initiate allocation of 1600-series on December 31, 2024
- Despite awareness campaigns, adoption has remained low with most entities continuing to use ten-digit mobile numbers
- Implementation will be phase-wise across RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA regulated entities
- The measure aims to provide BFSI entities distinct identity and enable consumers to make informed decisions about call acceptance

## Regulatory Changes

This Direction implements a mandatory requirement under the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018 (6 of 2018). Regulation 3 of these regulations already requires that commercial communications must use registered headers or number resources from special series assigned for commercial communication. The new 1600-series extends this framework specifically for service and transactional calls from BFSI entities.

Key regulatory framework:
- Based on TRAI Act, 1997 (24 of 1997) - sections 3, 11, 13, and 36
- Implements Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018
- Prohibits Senders not registered with Access Providers from making commercial communications
- Violation may result in suspension or disconnection of telecom resources

## Compliance Requirements

**Applicable Entities:**
- All entities regulated by Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
- All entities regulated by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
- All entities regulated by Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)

**Requirements:**
- Must adopt 1600-series numbers for all service and transactional voice calls
- Must discontinue use of ten-digit mobile numbers for such calls
- Must register with Access Providers for allocation of 1600-series numbers
- Must ensure compliance with phase-wise implementation timeline (specific phases to be detailed in full circular)
- Must coordinate with telecom Access Providers for number allocation

**Impact on Current Operations:**
- Entities currently using ten-digit mobile numbers for customer service and transactional calls must transition to 1600-series
- Systems and processes for outbound calling will need to be updated
- Customer communication and awareness about the new number series will be required

## Important Dates

- **December 23, 2024**: DoT allocated 1600-series for Government and BFSI entities
- **December 31, 2024**: TRAI directed Access Providers to initiate allocation
- **November 19, 2025**: TRAI Direction issued for mandatory phase-wise adoption
- **Phase-wise implementation dates**: To be specified in the complete circular (document appears truncated)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- All securities market intermediaries regulated by SEBI will need to implement changes
- Banks, NBFCs, insurance companies, pension funds, and financial services entities must comply
- May require significant operational and technical changes for entities with large customer bases

**Operational Impact:**
- Technology infrastructure updates required for call center systems
- Training required for customer service teams
- Potential customer confusion during transition period requiring awareness campaigns
- Coordination needed with multiple Access Providers for number allocation

**Consumer Protection Benefits:**
- Clear identification of legitimate BFSI entity calls versus spam/scam calls
- Reduced spam and potential fraud through promotional calls disguised as service calls
- Consumers can make informed decisions about accepting calls from 1600-series
- Enhanced trust in financial sector communications

**Compliance Risk:**
- Non-compliance may result in suspension or disconnection of telecom resources per Regulation 3(2)
- Regulatory action by respective sector regulators (RBI/SEBI/PFRDA) for non-adherence
- Reputational risk for entities unable to implement in mandated timeline

**Note**: The circular content appears to be truncated mid-sentence in section 7. The complete circular should be reviewed for full details on phase-wise implementation timeline and specific compliance requirements.
