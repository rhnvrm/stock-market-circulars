This decision follows SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-2/P/CIR/2024/116 dated August 30, 2024 regarding eligibility criteria of stocks and BSE Notice no 20240902-3 dated September 02, 2024 regarding review of eligibility criteria for entry/exit of stocks in derivatives segment. No new expiry month contracts will be generated for IIFL Finance Ltd (Derivatives Asset Code: IIFL, Equity Scrip Code: 532636).

- Derivatives Asset Code: IIFL

- Trading members must note that no contracts will be available for trading in this security after January 30, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

This exclusion is based on:
- SEBI Circular Ref. No: SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-2/P/CIR/2024/116 dated August 30, 2024 regarding eligibility criteria of stocks
- BSE Notice no 20240902-3 dated September 02, 2024 regarding review of eligibility criteria for entry/exit of stocks in derivatives segment

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants holding positions in IIFL Finance Ltd F&O contracts must plan to close or roll over positions before contract expiry
- No fresh positions can be initiated in new expiry months beyond January 2026

## Important Dates

- **November 24, 2025**: Notice date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Traders and investors with positions in IIFL Finance Ltd futures and options will need to unwind or square off their positions by January 29, 2026. This may lead to increased volatility in the contract as expiry approaches, particularly if there are large open positions.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems and communicate with clients holding IIFL derivatives positions. The absence of hedging instruments may affect institutional investors and proprietary traders who use derivatives for risk management in IIFL Finance Ltd equity positions.

**Liquidity Impact**: As the discontinuation date approaches, liquidity in IIFL derivatives contracts may decline as market participants avoid building new positions and existing position holders exit the market.
