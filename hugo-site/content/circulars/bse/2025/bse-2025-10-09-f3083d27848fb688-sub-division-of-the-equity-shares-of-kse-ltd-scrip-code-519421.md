## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action undertaken by KSE Ltd under existing regulations governing stock sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that the existing ISIN No. INE953E01014 (Rs.10/- paid up) will not be valid for transactions on or after October 28, 2025
- Trading members should await separate notice regarding the new ISIN number for Re.1/- paid up shares
- All trades executed on or after October 28, 2025 must use the new ISIN once communicated
- Demat account holdings will automatically reflect the sub-divided shares post-record date

## Important Dates

- **October 9, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 28, 2025**: Record date for sub-division
- **October 28, 2025**: Effective date for sub-divided shares (Re.1/- face value)
- **October 28, 2025**: Old ISIN becomes invalid for exchange transactions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The stock sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares tenfold while proportionally reducing the share price, making shares more affordable for retail investors and potentially improving liquidity. The total market capitalization of KSE Ltd remains unchanged.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and investors must ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN once communicated. Demat accounts will automatically reflect adjusted holdings. The lower face value may attract more retail participation and improve trading volumes.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares of Re.1/- each for every 1 share of Rs.10/- held as of the record date. The proportional ownership and total investment value remain unchanged.
