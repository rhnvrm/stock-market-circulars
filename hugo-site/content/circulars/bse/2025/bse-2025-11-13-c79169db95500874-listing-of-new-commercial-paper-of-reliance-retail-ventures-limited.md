## Impact Assessment

This is a routine commercial paper listing with minimal market impact. The issuance by Reliance Retail Ventures Limited, backed by strong CARE A1+ and CRISIL A1+ credit ratings, provides short-term debt investment opportunities for institutional investors and debt market participants. The listing expands the available commercial paper instruments on BSE's debt segment but does not affect equity markets or broader trading operations. Impact is limited to debt market participants and investors seeking short-term corporate debt instruments with a 91-day maturity period.
