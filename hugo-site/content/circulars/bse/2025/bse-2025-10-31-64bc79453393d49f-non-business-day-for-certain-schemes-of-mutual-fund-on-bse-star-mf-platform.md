## Compliance Requirements

- Investors should plan their transactions accordingly and avoid placing orders on the specified non-business days
- AMCs and distributors must inform investors about these non-business days
- No subscription, redemption, or switch transactions will be processed for the affected schemes on these dates

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational notice with minimal market impact. The non-business days are primarily due to holidays in the respective international markets where these funds invest (US, Japan, China, global markets). Investors in these specific schemes need to plan their transactions around these dates, but the broader market and other mutual fund schemes remain unaffected. The impact is limited to transaction processing delays for investors in the listed schemes.
