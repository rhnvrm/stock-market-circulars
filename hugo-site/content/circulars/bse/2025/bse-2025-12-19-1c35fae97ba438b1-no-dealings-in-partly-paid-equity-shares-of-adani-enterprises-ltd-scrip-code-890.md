  890227)
---

## Summary

BSE has directed trading members to cease dealings in partly paid equity shares of Adani Enterprises Ltd (Scrip Code 890227) effective December 23, 2025. This action is in connection with the company fixing a record date to identify eligible shareholders for the first call payment notice of Rs.450 per partly paid equity share, representing 25% of the issue price of Rs.1,800.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies only to partly paid equity shares (Scrip Code 890227), not fully paid shares
- Record date fixed as December 23, 2025
- First call amount is Rs.450 per partly paid equity share (Re.0.25 face value + Rs.449.75 premium)
- First call represents 25% of the total issue price of Rs.1,800 per share
- No dealings from December 23, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-783/2025-2026)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard operational suspension related to corporate action processing.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any transactions in partly paid equity shares of Adani Enterprises Ltd (Scrip Code 890227) from December 23, 2025
- Trading members must take note of this suspension and inform their clients accordingly
- Eligible shareholders of partly paid shares will receive first call payment notice from the company

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: December 19, 2025
- **Record Date**: December 23, 2025
- **No Dealings From**: December 23, 2025
- **Settlement Number**: DR-783/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of partly paid equity shares from Adani Enterprises' rights issue. Fully paid equity shares remain unaffected and can trade normally.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders holding partly paid shares cannot exit their positions through market sale from December 23, 2025. They must either pay the first call amount or face potential forfeiture of their partly paid shares as per rights issue terms.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to block trading in the specific scrip code 890227 while maintaining normal operations for the main Adani Enterprises equity shares.
