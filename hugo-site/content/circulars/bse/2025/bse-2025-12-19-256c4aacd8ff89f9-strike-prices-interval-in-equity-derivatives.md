---

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular specifying strike price intervals for equity derivative contracts across 70 securities. The strike price intervals vary based on the underlying security, ranging from ₹1 to ₹250, allowing for more granular or broader option strike selections depending on the stock's price characteristics.

## Key Points

- Strike price intervals updated for 70 equity derivative scrips
- Intervals range from ₹1 (low-priced stocks) to ₹250 (high-priced stocks)
- Major index constituents covered including ADANI ENTERPRISES (₹20), BAJAJ AUTO (₹100), HDFC BANK (₹5)
- Financial sector stocks predominantly have ₹10-₹20 intervals
- PSU banks and oil companies generally have smaller intervals (₹1-₹2.5)
- Premium stocks like BOSCH have wider intervals (₹250)
- Technology stocks like INFOSYS and HCL TECH have ₹20 intervals

## Regulatory Changes

This circular establishes standardized strike price intervals for equity derivative contracts. The intervals are calibrated based on stock price levels and trading characteristics:

- High-value stocks (₹50-₹250 intervals): BOSCH, DIXON, EICHER MOTORS, BAJAJ AUTO
- Mid-range stocks (₹10-₹50 intervals): Most banking, pharma, and IT stocks
- Lower-priced stocks (₹1-₹5 intervals): PSU banks, commodity stocks, telecom

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use specified strike price intervals for new derivative contracts
- Market makers and option writers need to adjust strategies to align with new strike intervals
- System providers must update derivative trading platforms to reflect correct strike intervals
- Risk management systems should be calibrated for the new strike price granularity

## Important Dates

Effective date not explicitly mentioned in the provided content. Implementation typically follows BSE's standard notice period for derivative contract specifications.
