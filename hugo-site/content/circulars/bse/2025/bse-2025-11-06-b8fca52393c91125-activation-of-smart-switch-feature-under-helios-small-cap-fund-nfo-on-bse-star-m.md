  StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

BSE has activated the SMART Switch feature for HELIOS SMALL CAP FUND – NFO on the BSE StAR MF platform. This feature allows investors to switch their investments from HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND (both Direct and Regular plans) into the new HELIOS SMALL CAP FUND NFO. The switch facility is available for both growth options of the overnight fund.

## Key Points

- SMART Switch feature activated for HELIOS SMALL CAP FUND NFO
- Applicable to HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND investors (Direct and Regular plans)
- Switch transactions from HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND-DIRECT PLAN-GROWTH will be reported to AMC/RTA under the same scheme name
- Switch transactions from HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND-REGULAR PLAN-GROWTH will be reported to AMC/RTA under the same scheme name
- Feature operational on BSE StAR MF platform

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational activation of an existing platform feature.

## Compliance Requirements

- Subscription received under NFO SMART Switch options to be processed as per the mapping table
- Transaction reporting to AMC/RTA must follow the specified scheme names:
  - Direct Plan switches reported as HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND-DIRECT PLAN-GROWTH
  - Regular Plan switches reported as HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND-REGULAR PLAN-GROWTH

## Important Dates

- Activation Date: November 6, 2025
- NFO period dates not specified in the circular

## Impact Assessment

Limited impact restricted to HELIOS Mutual Fund investors. The activation provides existing HELIOS OVERNIGHT FUND investors with a convenient mechanism to participate in the HELIOS SMALL CAP FUND NFO through the SMART Switch facility. This is a standard operational feature activation on BSE's mutual fund platform and does not affect broader market operations or other market participants.
