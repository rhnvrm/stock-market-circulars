One new security (NR Agarwal Industries Ltd) has been added to this framework effective December 18, 2025, bringing the total consolidated list to 9 securities. No securities are being removed from this measure.

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements ongoing surveillance under SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations 2011, specifically Regulation 28(3) which governs disclosure requirements for encumbered shares. The framework is designed to monitor and restrict trading in securities where both promoter and non-promoter shareholdings show high levels of pledge/encumbrance, indicating potential financial stress or elevated risk.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 18, 2025 - New additions and surveillance measures take effect
- **Circular Date**: December 17, 2025

- Reduced investor confidence and participation
