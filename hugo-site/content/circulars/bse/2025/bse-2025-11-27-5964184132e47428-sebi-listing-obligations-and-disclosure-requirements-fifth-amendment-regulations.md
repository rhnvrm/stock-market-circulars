### Regulation 12 - Amendment

### Regulation 23 - Related Party Transactions

**Sub-regulation (1) - Material RPT Threshold:**
- Previous threshold: Greater of ₹1,000 crore or 10% of annual consolidated turnover

- Applies to transactions requiring shareholder approval

**Sub-regulation (2) - Subsidiary Transactions:**

New clause (kh) introduced for subsidiary-level related party transactions:

**Transactions exceeding ₹1 crore** (individually or cumulatively in the financial year) where:
- The listed entity's subsidiary is a party, BUT
- The listed entity itself is not a party

**Require audit committee approval if the transaction value exceeds:**

(i) 10% of the subsidiary's annual standalone turnover (based on last audited financial statements); OR

(ii) The limit specified in Schedule XII

**Such transactions shall be deemed material transactions** between the listed entity and the related party.

## Compliance Requirements

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Policy Updates**: Listed entities must update their Related Party Transaction policies to incorporate new definitions and thresholds

2. **Process Implementation**: Establish mechanisms to track and monitor subsidiary-level related party transactions exceeding ₹1 crore

3. **Audit Committee Procedures**: Revise audit committee approval processes to include subsidiary transactions meeting the new criteria

4. **Schedule XII Review**: Refer to Schedule XII of LODR Regulations for specific materiality thresholds (entities must obtain and review Schedule XII)

5. **Disclosure Framework**: Update disclosure templates and processes to capture expanded definition of related parties including key managerial personnel and relatives

6. **Training**: Conduct training for finance, secretarial, and compliance teams on new requirements

7. **System Updates**: Modify internal tracking systems to identify transactions involving:
   - Key managerial personnel and their relatives
   - Subsidiary-level RPTs meeting new thresholds

### Ongoing Compliance

- Monitor all subsidiary transactions with related parties on a cumulative basis throughout the financial year
- Ensure audit committee approval is obtained before execution of qualifying transactions
- Maintain detailed records of all related party transactions for both parent and subsidiary level
- Update materiality assessment frameworks based on Schedule XII thresholds

## Important Dates

- **November 18, 2025**: Publication date in Official Gazette
- **November 18, 2025**: General effective date for most provisions
- **November 21, 2025**: Effective date for Regulation 3 (Sub-regulations I, III, and VII) - third day after publication
- **Financial Year Basis**: Cumulative transaction tracking to be done on financial year basis for subsidiary RPTs

## Impact Assessment

### Listed Entities

**High Impact** - All listed companies must immediately:
- Review and revise RPT policies and procedures
- Implement enhanced monitoring for subsidiary transactions
- Expand internal controls to capture transactions involving key managerial personnel and relatives
- Reference Schedule XII for updated materiality thresholds (replacing the previous ₹1,000 crore/10% turnover formula)

### Subsidiaries

**Significant Impact** - Subsidiaries of listed entities face:
- New reporting obligations for related party transactions exceeding ₹1 crore
- Parent company audit committee oversight for transactions exceeding 10% of subsidiary's standalone turnover
- Enhanced documentation and approval requirements

### Key Managerial Personnel

**Medium-High Impact**:
- Transactions involving KMPs and their relatives now subject to stricter scrutiny
- Enhanced disclosure requirements
- Uniform terms and conditions requirements across all employee/director/KMP categories

### Audit Committees

**High Impact**:
- Expanded mandate to review subsidiary-level transactions
- Additional meeting agenda items for subsidiary RPT approvals
- Need for enhanced information systems to track multi-tier transactions

### Market-Wide Implications

- **Transparency**: Enhanced transparency in related party dealings at group level
- **Governance**: Strengthened corporate governance framework for listed entities and their subsidiaries
- **Compliance Burden**: Increased compliance and monitoring requirements, particularly for entities with multiple subsidiaries
- **Disclosure Quality**: Improved quality of related party disclosures with expanded definitions
- **Risk Management**: Better risk management through audit committee oversight of subsidiary transactions

### Operational Considerations
