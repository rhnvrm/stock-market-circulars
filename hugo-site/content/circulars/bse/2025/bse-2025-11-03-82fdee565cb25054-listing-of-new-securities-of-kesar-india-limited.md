## Compliance Requirements

Minimal market impact expected. The preferential allotment represents a relatively small addition to the company's equity base. The lock-in period until May 15, 2026 ensures these shares will not immediately affect trading liquidity. This is a standard corporate action for capital raising through preferential allotment to non-promoters.
