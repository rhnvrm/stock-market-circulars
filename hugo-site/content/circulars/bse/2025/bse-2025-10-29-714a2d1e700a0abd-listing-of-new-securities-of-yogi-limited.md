## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a company-specific listing event with no broader market implications.

**Trading Impact:** The addition of 1.096 crore shares represents a capital expansion for YOGI Limited. However, with 100% of the new shares under lock-in (varying periods), immediate trading liquidity impact will be minimal.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders should note the dilution effect from the preferential allotment. The lock-in periods (ranging from approximately 8 months to 2.5 years from trading commencement) provide stability against immediate selling pressure from allottees.

**Operational Impact:** Standard listing procedure with no special conditions or unusual features requiring additional operational attention from market participants.
