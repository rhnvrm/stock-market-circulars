## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Market participants in the mutual fund segment must plan their operations, staffing, and client servicing around 15 weekday closures throughout 2026. This includes transaction processing, customer service, and settlement activities.

**Market Impact:** Low direct market impact as holidays are pre-announced and standard practice. Investors and intermediaries can plan their investment activities and redemptions accordingly.

**Planning Considerations:** The distribution of holidays is relatively spread throughout the year, with multiple holidays in March-April (5 holidays) and October-November (4 holidays). Market participants should account for these clusters when planning business activities and client communications.
