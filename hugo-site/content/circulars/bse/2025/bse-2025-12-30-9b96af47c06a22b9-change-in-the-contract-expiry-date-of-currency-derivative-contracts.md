## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects all participants trading currency derivatives with March, May, and June 2026 expiries. Market participants must adjust their trading strategies, hedging programs, and position management to account for earlier expiry dates.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members need to update their systems, risk management tools, and client communications. The one-to-two day advancement in expiry dates may affect settlement planning and position rollover strategies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Low to Medium - Earlier expiry dates may shift liquidity patterns slightly as traders adjust rollover timings, particularly for the March contracts where multiple segments are affected simultaneously.

**Risk Management**: Trading members should ensure their risk monitoring systems reflect the updated expiry dates to avoid unwanted position carrying or forced settlement on incorrect dates.
