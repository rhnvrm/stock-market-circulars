## Impact Assessment

This is a routine informational bulletin with minimal market impact. The dividend announcement for Central Bank of India (Rs. 0.20 per share) and income distribution from Embassy Office Parks REIT may have modest positive impact on those specific securities. The cancelled NCD redemption for Indel Money Limited indicates potential issuer-side developments that investors should monitor. Overall, this bulletin serves as a reference document for investors to track corporate action eligibility dates across multiple securities.
