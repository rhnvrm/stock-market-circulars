## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 139 securities with varying quantities. Large quantities in certain scrips (FCS SOFTWARE - 141,997 shares, INDIAN INFOT - 43,771 shares) may impact those specific stocks during auction execution.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Brokers and clearing members with shortages in these securities must arrange for funds to participate in the auction or face penalties. The wide variety of scrips indicates multiple settlement failures across different members.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Retail investors are generally not directly affected, but institutional investors and traders with positions in these securities may see temporary price movements during auction periods.

**Liquidity Impact:** The auction mechanism ensures settlement completion and maintains market integrity by forcing closure of outstanding obligations.
