## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - A significant portion of shares (approximately 84% excluding public float) are under various lock-in periods, which will limit immediate tradable float and potentially affect liquidity. The staggered unlocking schedule will gradually increase available shares over 3 years.

**Operational Impact**: Low - This is a standard post-IPO listing requirement with no additional operational burden beyond normal compliance.

**Investor Impact**: Medium - Retail investors should be aware that only approximately 1.07 crore shares (15.7% of total) are immediately tradable without restrictions, which may impact price discovery and volatility in early trading days.
