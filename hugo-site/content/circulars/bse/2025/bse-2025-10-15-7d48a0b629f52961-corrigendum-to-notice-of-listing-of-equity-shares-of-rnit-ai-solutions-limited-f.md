## Summary

BSE has issued a corrigendum revising the listing date for equity shares of RNIT AI Solutions Limited (formerly known as Autopal Industries Limited).

Trading will continue in the Trade-to-Trade segment as per earlier notice dated February 10, 2023.

## Key Points

- Revised listing date: October 24, 2025 (Friday)
- Company name: RNIT AI Solutions Limited (formerly Autopal Industries Limited)
- Listing group: XT Group
- Trading segment: Trade-to-Trade (T2T) segment
- Date change requested by the company via email dated October 14, 2025

## Important Dates

- **October 14, 2025**: Company requested date change via email
- **October 14, 2025**: Original notices issued (20251014-23 and 20251014-24)
- **October 15, 2025**: Corrigendum notice issued
- **October 24, 2025**: Revised listing and trading commencement date (Friday)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects trading members and investors who were preparing for the original listing date. The postponement allows additional time for preparations.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and communications regarding the revised listing date. The continued T2T segment classification means stricter settlement requirements remain in place.

**Company Impact**: The company-requested date change suggests potential operational or administrative reasons requiring additional preparation time before public listing.

**Investor Impact**: Investors planning to trade these shares must adjust their trading strategies according to the new October 24, 2025 date. T2T segment classification requires full upfront payment and delivery, limiting speculative trading.
