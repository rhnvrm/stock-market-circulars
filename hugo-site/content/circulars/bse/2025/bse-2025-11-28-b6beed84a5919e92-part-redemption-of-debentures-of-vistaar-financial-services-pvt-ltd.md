## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine part redemption of privately placed debentures with limited market participation.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members dealing in these specific debentures must update their systems to reflect the reduced face value to ensure accurate pricing and settlement. The part redemption reduces the outstanding principal amount by approximately 58.3% (from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 41,666.67).

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders receive partial principal repayment along with accrued interest. Remaining investment continues at the same coupon rate (9.75%) until maturity in 2027, but on the reduced principal amount.
