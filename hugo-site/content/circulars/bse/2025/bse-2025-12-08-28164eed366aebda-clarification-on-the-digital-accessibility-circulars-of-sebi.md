title: Clarification on SEBI Digital Accessibility Circulars - Revised Compliance
  Timeline
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued clarifications on previously released digital accessibility circulars (issued July 31, August 29, and September 25, 2025), extending the compliance deadline and modifying requirements. Instead of appointing accessibility auditors by December 14, 2025, regulated entities must now submit a status report on their digital accessibility readiness by March 31, 2026. The circular also establishes that digital accessibility will be included as an investor right in respective Investor Charters and enables investors to lodge accessibility-related complaints through SCORES.

## Key Points

- "Investors' Right to have digital accessibility" will be included in Investor Charters applicable to various regulated entities
- Original December 14, 2025 deadline for accessibility auditor appointment is replaced with March 31, 2026 status reporting requirement
- REs must submit readiness and compliance status for each digital platform to specified reporting authorities
- Accessibility complaint category already available on SCORES for investors facing issues with REs' digital platforms
- REs must remediate accessibility issues for complaint closure
- Periodic accessibility audits required through certified accessibility professionals
- Circular references three prior SEBI circulars: SEBI/HO/ITD-1/ITD_VIAP/P/CIR/2025/111, 121, and 131

## Regulatory Changes

- Extension of compliance timeline from December 14, 2025 to March 31, 2026
- Change from mandatory accessibility auditor appointment to status reporting requirement
- Introduction of formal complaint redressal mechanism via SCORES for accessibility issues
- Inclusion of digital accessibility as a formal investor right in Investor Charters
- Requirement for ongoing periodic accessibility audits by certified professionals

## Compliance Requirements

**For All Regulated Entities:**
- Submit status of readiness and compliance to accessibility requirements for each investor-facing digital platform by March 31, 2026
- Submit to specified reporting authorities as per Annexure A
- For entities reporting directly to SEBI: send status to digital_acc@sebi.gov.in

- Remediate accessibility issues raised through SCORES complaints

**Reporting Structure:**
- Stock Brokers/Depository Participants → Report to Stock Exchanges/Depositories

- 15 categories of REs (including AIFs, Mutual Funds, Credit Rating Agencies, Clearing Corporations, etc.) → Report directly to SEBI to concerned departments

**Format:** Refer to Annexure B for status submission format (format details provided in circular)

## Important Dates

- **December 08, 2025:** Circular issuance date

- **March 31, 2026:** New deadline for submitting status of readiness and compliance to accessibility requirements

## Impact Assessment

**Market-Wide Impact:**
This circular affects all regulated entities in the securities market including stock brokers, depository participants, investment advisors, research analysts, mutual funds, portfolio managers, credit rating agencies, clearing corporations, depositories, and 15+ other categories of intermediaries. The extended timeline provides breathing room for compliance while maintaining regulatory focus on digital inclusion.

**Investor Protection:**
Establishes formal mechanism for accessibility-related grievances through SCORES, ensuring investors with disabilities have recourse when facing barriers on digital platforms. Inclusion in Investor Charters elevates digital accessibility to a recognized investor right.

**Operational Impact:**
REs must assess all investor-facing digital platforms (websites, mobile apps, portals) for accessibility compliance and implement periodic audit frameworks. The shift from immediate auditor appointment to status reporting allows entities to plan implementation more effectively while demonstrating progress to regulators.

**Compliance Burden:**
Moderate compliance burden with requirement for status reporting by March 31, 2026 and ongoing periodic audits. REs must establish internal processes for accessibility complaint handling and remediation to ensure SCORES complaint closure.
