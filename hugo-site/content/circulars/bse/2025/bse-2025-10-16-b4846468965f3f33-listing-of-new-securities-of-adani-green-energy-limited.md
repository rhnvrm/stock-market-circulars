## Impact Assessment

This listing represents a preferential allotment to promoters through warrant conversion, which increases promoter shareholding in Adani Green Energy Limited. The issue price of Rs. 1480.75 indicates a significant premium over face value. The lock-in period of approximately 18 months from the trading date ensures promoter commitment. The shares being pari-passu with existing equity means they carry the same rights and privileges. This is a routine corporate action with medium market impact due to the promoter nature of the allotment and the relatively small size compared to the company's total equity base.
