- Orders will appear in Provisional Order Report with September 05 date but Order Status Report will show September 08 date
- Redemption/Switch/STP orders in all scheme categories will be accepted and reported on September 05
- Both redemption unit pay-in and pay-out will be processed same day for September 05 orders

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes - this is operational guidance for holiday procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must follow specified reporting procedures for different fund categories
- Registrars to process orders according to the timeline specified
- NAV applicability rules as per attached Annexure must be followed

## Important Dates

- **September 05, 2025**: Eid-e-Milad holiday, special transaction procedures apply
