## Impact Assessment

### Operational Impact:

**High Compliance Burden**: All trading members must implement processes to track, document, and report cyber incidents on a quarterly basis. This requires dedicated cybersecurity personnel and incident tracking systems.

**Immediate Action Required**: With the January 15, 2026 deadline, trading members have only 14 days from circular issuance to submit their Q4 2025 reports, requiring immediate mobilization of compliance teams.

**Disciplinary Risk**: Non-submission or delayed submission triggers disciplinary action as prescribed in Exchange Circular NSE/INSP/70746, creating compliance risk for trading members.

### Market Impact:

**Enhanced Cybersecurity Posture**: The mandatory reporting framework improves overall market cybersecurity by ensuring systematic tracking and reporting of incidents across all regulated entities.

**Transparency and Oversight**: SEBI and NSE gain comprehensive visibility into cybersecurity threats affecting trading members, enabling better risk assessment and mitigation strategies.

**Regulatory Alignment**: Aligns Indian securities market with global best practices for cyber incident reporting and resilience.

### Technology Impact:

**Portal Modernization**: The simplified submission process through ENIT-NEW-TRADE portal with waived digital signature requirements reduces technical barriers to compliance.

**Standardized Reporting**: Auto-populated forms and standardized PDF generation ensure consistent data quality for regulatory analysis.
