## Summary

NSE has issued a surveillance circular regarding the applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework. Securities meeting ASM criteria will face 100% margin requirements on all positions effective February 5, 2026. Additionally, securities qualifying under Criteria VII (Stage IV) will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE). Currently, Mahickra Chemicals Limited has been shortlisted under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I.

## Key Points

- One security (MAHICKRA - Mahickra Chemicals Limited, ISIN: INE961Y01015) shortlisted in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I effective February 3, 2026
- 100% margin requirement applicable on all open positions as on February 4, 2026 and new positions from February 5, 2026 onwards
- Securities in Stage IV will be shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ series) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE series)
- Currently no securities listed for Stage IV or inter-stage movements (Stage I to II, Stage II to III, Stage I to IV, Stage II to IV)
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance purposes and not an adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the Long-Term ASM framework as per previous circulars (NSE/SURV/39265, NSE/SURV/45111, NSE/SURV/46557, NSE/SURV/48506, NSE/SURV/52090, NSE/SURV/63362, and NSE/SURV/64066). The framework includes:

- Imposition of 100% margin requirement for securities meeting ASM criteria
- Four-stage surveillance framework with escalating measures
- Transfer mechanism from rolling settlement to trade-for-trade for Stage IV securities
- Application of surveillance measures on T+3 basis (T being date of circular issuance)

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must apply 100% margin requirement for MAHICKRA effective February 5, 2026
- Margin applies to both existing open positions as on February 4, 2026 and all new positions created from February 5, 2026
- Members must monitor for any securities moving to Stage IV which would require trade-for-trade settlement
- Members should refer to FAQs at https://www.nseindia.com/regulations/additional-surveillance-measure for detailed framework understanding
- Queries to be directed to surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **February 2, 2026**: Circular issuance date
- **February 3, 2026**: Effective date for ASM Stage-I shortlisting
- **February 4, 2026**: Last day for existing positions before new margin requirement
- **February 5, 2026**: 100% margin requirement becomes applicable on all positions
- **T+3 basis**: Timeline for shifting Stage IV securities from EQ to BE series (where T is circular date)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The 100% margin requirement significantly restricts leveraged trading in MAHICKRA, requiring full upfront capital for any positions. This will substantially reduce trading volumes and liquidity in the affected security.

**Market Participants**: Existing position holders must ensure adequate margins by February 5, 2026, or face potential liquidation. New traders will need full capital commitment, eliminating intraday leverage opportunities.

**Liquidity**: Enhanced surveillance measures typically result in reduced market participation, wider bid-ask spreads, and lower trading volumes. The potential shift to trade-for-trade segment for Stage IV securities further restricts liquidity by eliminating intraday trading.

**Investor Sentiment**: While NSE clarifies this is not adverse action against the company, ASM inclusion generally signals heightened regulatory scrutiny and may negatively impact investor confidence in the affected securities.
