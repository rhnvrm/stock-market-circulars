## Summary

NSE has announced updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective January 19-20, 2026. Manaksia Aluminium Company Limited has been added to ESM Stage-I, attracting a minimum 100% margin requirement and shifting from rolling settlement (EQ/SM) to trade-for-trade segment (BE/ST). Vipul Limited is moving from Stage-I to Stage-II, which involves trade-for-trade with 2% price band under periodic call auction. Two securities (Century Extrusions Limited and DRS Cargo Movers Limited) are being excluded from the ESM framework.

## Key Points

- Manaksia Aluminium Company Limited (MANAKALUCO) added to ESM Stage-I effective January 19, 2026
- Vipul Limited (VIPULLTD) moving from ESM Stage-I to Stage-II effective January 19, 2026
- Securities in ESM Stage-I will attract minimum 100% margin on all open and new positions
- Securities shifting to Stage-I will move from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST)
- Stage-II securities will be under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- Century Extrusions Limited (CENTEXT) and DRS Cargo Movers Limited (DRSCARGO) excluded from ESM framework
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting under ESM is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

The circular updates the Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework based on previous circulars NSE/SURV/56948 (June 02, 2023), NSE/SURV/57609 (July 18, 2023), NSE/SURV/63361 (August 09, 2024), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), NSE/SURV/64400 (October 04, 2024), and NSE/SURV/69315 (July 25, 2025). Securities meeting ESM criteria face enhanced trading restrictions including mandatory trade-for-trade settlement and increased margin requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with 100% margin requirement for securities under ESM Stage-I
- Margin applies to all open positions as on January 19, 2026, and new positions from January 20, 2026
- Trading members must adapt to trade-for-trade settlement mechanism for affected securities
- For Stage-II securities, participants must operate within 2% price band constraints under periodic call auction mechanism
- Members should refer to consolidated list in Annexure III for complete list of securities under ESM framework
- For queries, members may contact surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **January 16, 2026**: Circular issued
- **January 19, 2026**: Stage-II securities come under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction; 100% margin becomes applicable on open positions
- **January 20, 2026**: Securities shifting to Stage-I move from EQ/SM to BE/ST segment; 100% margin applies on new positions created from this date

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ESM Stage-I face significant trading restrictions with 100% margin requirement, making leveraged trading impossible and substantially increasing capital requirements for traders. The shift to trade-for-trade segment eliminates intraday trading opportunities.

**Liquidity Impact**: Enhanced surveillance measures typically reduce liquidity as higher margins and trade-for-trade settlement deter speculative activity. Stage-II securities face additional constraints with 2% price band and periodic call auction mechanism.

**Investor Impact**: Existing position holders in Manaksia Aluminium must arrange for 100% margin by January 19, 2026. Vipul Limited investors will experience more restrictive trading conditions under Stage-II framework.

**Market Perception**: While NSE clarifies that ESM listing is not adverse action against companies, such measures often signal concerns about price volatility or market manipulation, potentially affecting investor sentiment.

**Positive Development**: Exclusion of Century Extrusions and DRS Cargo Movers from ESM framework indicates improved market behavior for these securities, with restoration of normal trading conditions.
