title: Applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) - February
  27, 2026
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a circular announcing the applicability of the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective February 27, 2026. Five securities have been newly shortlisted under ST-ASM Stage-I, one security (EASEMYTRIP) has been excluded from the ASM framework, and no securities are moving between Stage-I and Stage-II in either direction.

## Key Points

- 5 securities newly added to ST-ASM Framework Stage-I effective February 27, 2026
- No securities shortlisted under ST-ASM Stage-II
- No securities moving from Stage-I to Stage-II or Stage-II to Stage-I
- 1 security (EASEMYTRIP - Easy Trip Planners Limited) excluded from ASM Framework effective February 27, 2026
- Consolidated ASM list contains at least 34 securities under Stage-I surveillance

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework is a surveillance mechanism used by NSE to monitor securities exhibiting abnormal price/volume movements. Securities placed under ST-ASM are subject to enhanced margin requirements and other trading restrictions to curb excessive speculation and protect market integrity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Brokers and trading members must apply applicable ST-ASM margin requirements for newly added securities from February 27, 2026
- Clients holding or trading in ASM-listed securities must maintain higher margins as prescribed
- EASEMYTRIP margins and restrictions revert to normal from February 27, 2026 upon exclusion

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** February 27, 2026 — All additions, exclusions, and stage changes take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Newly Added to ST-ASM Stage-I (effective February 27, 2026):**
| Sr. No. | Symbol | Security Name | ISIN |
|---------|--------|---------------|------|
| 1 | CLEDUCATE | CL Educate Limited | INE201M01029 |
| 2 | JINDALPOLY | Jindal Poly Films Limited | INE197D01010 |
| 3 | KAYTEX | Kaytex Fabrics Limited | INE13ZD01013 |
| 4 | TAC | TAC Infosec Limited | INE0SOY01013 |
| 5 | YATRA | Yatra Online Limited | INE0JR601024 |

**Excluded from ASM Framework (effective February 27, 2026):**
| Sr. No. | Symbol | Security Name | ISIN |
|---------|--------|---------------|------|
| 1 | EASEMYTRIP | Easy Trip Planners Limited | INE07O001026 |

**Market Impact:** Traders and investors in the five newly added securities will face increased margin requirements and potential circuit filter restrictions, reducing leverage and liquidity. EASEMYTRIP investors benefit from removal of these restrictions. The broad consolidated ASM list (34+ securities) underscores NSE's active surveillance of potentially volatile or manipulated counters.
