- Risk Profile: Relatively high interest rate risk and relatively low credit risk

**Surviving Scheme Details:**
- TRUSTMF Corporate Bond Fund: Open-ended debt scheme predominantly investing in AA+ and above rated corporate bonds
- Risk Profile: Relatively high interest rate risk and moderate credit risk

## Compliance Requirements

- Facilitate redemptions and switches through NSE MF Invest platform during exit period

**For Unitholders:**
- Review the merger notice and scheme characteristics
- If not in favor of merger, redeem investments or switch to other Trust Mutual Fund schemes before February 10, 2026

## Important Dates

- **February 11, 2026**: Merger effective date, merging scheme ceases to exist, all systematic plans shift to surviving scheme

## Impact Assessment

**Unitholder Impact:**
Unitholders of TRUSTMF Banking & PSU Fund will see their investments automatically transferred to TRUSTMF Corporate Bond Fund unless they opt to exit. The surviving scheme has moderate credit risk compared to relatively low credit risk in the merging scheme, representing a change in risk profile. Both schemes maintain relatively high interest rate risk.

**Operational Impact:**
All existing systematic investment plans (SIP/XSIP/STP/SWP) will continue seamlessly but will be transferred to the surviving scheme. Unitholders who wish to maintain exposure to banking and PSU debt instruments specifically will need to actively switch to alternative schemes during the exit window.

**Market Impact:**
Limited broader market impact as this affects only specific mutual fund schemes. The consolidation reduces scheme duplication within Trust Mutual Fund's product offerings. Trading and operations continue normally on NSE MF Invest platform throughout the process.
