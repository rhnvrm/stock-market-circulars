title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - Long Term Framework
---

## Summary

NSE has applied Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework to specific securities effective January 02, 2026. Two securities are newly shortlisted: Onyx Biotec Limited enters Stage-I, and Indosolar Limited (WAAREEINDO) enters Stage-IV. A 100% margin requirement will apply from January 06, 2026 on all open and new positions. Indosolar Limited will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE) effective January 06, 2026.

## Key Points

- Long-Term ASM framework applied based on surveillance criteria outlined in previous circulars from 2018-2024
- Onyx Biotec Limited (ONYX) shortlisted in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- Indosolar Limited (WAAREEINDO) shortlisted in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-IV
- 100% margin applicable on all open positions as of January 05, 2026 and new positions from January 06, 2026 onwards
- WAAREEINDO shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ series) to Trade-for-Trade (BE series) from January 06, 2026
- No securities moving between stages (Stage-I to Stage-II, Stage-II to Stage-III, Stage-I to Stage-IV, or Stage-II to Stage-IV)
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance purposes and not an adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the Long-Term ASM framework as established under previous NSE circulars (NSE/SURV/39265, NSE/SURV/45111, NSE/SURV/46557, NSE/SURV/48506, NSE/SURV/52090, NSE/SURV/63362, and NSE/SURV/64066). The key regulatory actions are:

1. **Margin Requirements**: 100% margin rate applied to affected securities
2. **Segment Transfer**: Securities meeting Criteria VII (Stage-IV) transferred from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment on T+3 basis (T-day being circular issuance date)
3. **Framework Application**: ASM measures apply alongside all other existing surveillance measures

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Ensure 100% margin collection on all open positions in affected securities as of January 05, 2026
- Apply 100% margin on all new positions in affected securities from January 06, 2026
- Update trading systems to reflect WAAREEINDO segment change from EQ to BE series
- Comply with Trade-for-Trade settlement requirements for WAAREEINDO from January 06, 2026

**For Market Participants:**
- Note that affected securities will require full upfront margin for trading
- Understand that WAAREEINDO can only be traded on a delivery basis (no intraday trading) from January 06, 2026
- Monitor NSE surveillance communications for any further updates

## Important Dates

- **January 01, 2026**: Circular issuance date
- **January 02, 2026**: ASM framework Stage classification becomes effective
- **January 05, 2026**: Last day before margin requirement applies; 100% margin required on open positions as of this date
- **January 06, 2026**: 
  - 100% margin requirement takes effect on all positions
  - WAAREEINDO shifted from EQ series to BE series (Trade-for-Trade)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- **High impact on affected securities**: 100% margin requirement will significantly reduce leverage and may decrease trading volumes in ONYX and WAAREEINDO
- **Liquidity constraints**: Full margin requirement eliminates intraday trading opportunities and increases capital requirements for position-taking
- **WAAREEINDO specific impact**: Trade-for-Trade classification removes all intraday liquidity, requiring delivery settlement for all transactions

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members must adjust margin collection systems and risk management frameworks
- Investors holding positions in these securities must arrange for increased margin funds
- Surveillance framework escalation indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny on price movements and trading patterns in these securities

**Investor Considerations:**
- Higher capital requirements for trading these securities
- Reduced liquidity and wider bid-ask spreads likely
- Potential for further surveillance actions if securities continue to meet ASM criteria
- WAAREEINDO investors must take compulsory delivery, affecting short-term trading strategies
