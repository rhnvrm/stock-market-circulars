## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. These are routine further issue listings representing small percentages of existing equity bases for most companies. ESOP allotments are standard compensation practices with no lock-in, allowing immediate trading. 

**Operational Impact**: Low. The preferential allotments for MIRC Electronics (88.9 million shares) and Orchasp (26.9 million shares) are more substantial but already factored into market expectations given their October and December 2025 allotment dates. Lock-in periods provide stability by preventing immediate sale of preferentially allotted shares.

**Investor Impact**: Marginal dilution effect across all companies. Investors should note distinctive number ranges for record-keeping purposes.
