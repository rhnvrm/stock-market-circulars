## Impact Assessment

This revision directly affects trading members who use ETF positions for cross-margining against Futures & Options or other segment positions. Changes in minimum quantity thresholds can alter the margin offsets available to members, impacting capital efficiency. Members holding positions in newly added or removed ETFs, or those with altered minimum quantities, will need to reassess their margin utilization from February 25, 2026. The broad coverage across major indices (Nifty 50, Bank Nifty, Midcap, PSU Bank, IT, Pharma, Infra) and multiple fund houses ensures wide market participation. No immediate trading disruption is expected; this is a standard periodic update to maintain alignment with market liquidity and risk parameters.
