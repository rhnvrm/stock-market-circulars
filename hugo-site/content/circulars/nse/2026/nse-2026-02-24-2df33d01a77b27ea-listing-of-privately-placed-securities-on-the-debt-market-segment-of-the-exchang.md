## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational circular with no material impact on equity markets. The listings provide institutional investors and debt market participants access to short-term money market instruments from financially established corporates. The issuances reflect active short-term borrowing activity by large financial sector entities (Aditya Birla Money, HDFC Securities, Axis Securities, IndoStar Capital Finance) and industrial companies (Godrej Industries, CEAT, Tata Projects, Cholamandalam Securities). The significant discount to face value on longer-dated CPs (e.g., Axis Securities at ₹4,65,334.5 vs. ₹5,00,000 face value for a ~1-year tenor) reflects prevailing short-term interest rates. No action is required by equity market participants.
