The ten CPs represent short-to-medium term funding instruments (tenors ranging approximately 44 days to approximately one year) for well-known corporate issuers. Debt market participants and institutional investors should note the new security codes for trading purposes. No impact on equity markets or general compliance obligations for listed companies.
