**Market Impact**: Minimal. This represents a conversion of existing partly paid-up shares to fully paid-up status rather than fresh capital raising. The 7.46 lakh shares constitute a small incremental addition to UPL's existing equity base.

**Trading Impact**: The shares will be pari passu with existing equity shares and have no lock-in restrictions, making them immediately available for trading. The market lot size of 1 allows retail participation.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will see these additional shares credited to their demat accounts under the permanent ISIN after migration from the temporary ISIN.
