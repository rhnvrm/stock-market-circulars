## Summary

NSE has admitted further equity shares of 14 companies to trading on the Capital Market segment effective February 11, 2026. The securities were issued primarily under Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and one warrant conversion. All securities will trade with market lot size of 1 and are pari passu with existing shares.

## Key Points

- **Aurum PropTech Limited**: 52,513 equity shares allotted under ESOP on January 29, 2026
- **BlackBuck Limited**: Two separate ESOP allotments totaling 209,416 shares (132,671 + 76,745) on January 27, 2026
- **CreditAccess Grameen Limited**: 10,925 equity shares allotted under ESOP on February 5, 2026
- **Crown Lifters Limited**: 52,500 equity shares allotted on April 21, 2025 from warrant conversion at Rs. 268 per share (lock-in until August 31, 2027)
- **Cyient Limited**: ESOP allotment details (partial information provided in circular)
- Additional companies: DOMS Industries, Hero MotoCorp, IIFL Capital Services, IndusInd Bank, Moschip Technologies, Netweb Technologies, Shoppers Stop, Vaibhav Global, and VA Tech Wabag (details in annexure)
- All securities trade with market lot size of 1
- All securities are pari passu with existing shares
- Trading identification by designated security codes only

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine listing notification under Regulation 3.1.1 and Regulation 2.5.5 of the NSE (Capital Market) Trading Regulations Part A.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use designated security codes for trading these securities
- Securities must be traded in specified lot sizes (market lot of 1 for all listed securities)
- Lock-in period applicable only to Crown Lifters Limited preferential allotment (until August 31, 2027)
- No lock-in for ESOP allotments

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 11, 2026
- **Circular Issue Date**: February 10, 2026
- **Allotment Dates**:
  - Aurum PropTech: January 29, 2026
  - BlackBuck: January 27, 2026
  - CreditAccess Grameen: February 5, 2026
  - Crown Lifters: April 21, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry** (Crown Lifters only): August 31, 2027

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The further issues represent small percentages of outstanding shares for each company, primarily from employee compensation programs. The Crown Lifters warrant conversion represents a larger percentage stake but is subject to lock-in restrictions.

**Trading Impact**: Negligible. All securities trade with standard market lot of 1 and are fungible with existing shares (pari passu). No special trading restrictions except the lock-in period for Crown Lifters preferential allotment.

**Dilution**: Minor dilution to existing shareholders across all companies. ESOP allotments are routine corporate actions for employee retention and motivation.

**Liquidity**: Marginal increase in tradable float for most companies once the new shares enter circulation, except for locked-in Crown Lifters shares.
