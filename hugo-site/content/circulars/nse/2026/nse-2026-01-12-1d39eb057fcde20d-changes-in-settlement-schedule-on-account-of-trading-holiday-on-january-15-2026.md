- Settlement originally scheduled for January 16, 2026 (for January 15 trades) is now not applicable
- This circular modifies the earlier circular NCL/CMPT/71930 dated December 22, 2025
- Reference circular: NSE/FAOP/72262 dated January 12, 2026

## Compliance Requirements

- Members should adjust their operational processes to account for the trading holiday on January 15, 2026
- No settlement activities will be conducted for the holiday date

## Important Dates
