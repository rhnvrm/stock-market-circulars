## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing of preferential allotment shares for a single SME company. The addition of 960,000 shares represents a further issue that increases the tradable float of Transwind Infrastructures Limited on the SME platform.

**Operational Impact**: Limited to trading members dealing in TRANSWIND shares who need to be aware of the increased share count and the lock-in restrictions on these specific shares.

**Investor Impact**: Existing and potential investors in Transwind Infrastructures Limited should note the dilution from this preferential issue and the lock-in period that restricts immediate liquidity of these shares until July 2027.
