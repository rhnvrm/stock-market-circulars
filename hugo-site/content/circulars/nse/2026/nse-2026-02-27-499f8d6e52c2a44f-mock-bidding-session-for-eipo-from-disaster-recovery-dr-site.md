- Normal market hours: 10:00 hrs to 17:00 hrs
- All bids from the mock session carry zero obligation in terms of funds and securities

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a purely operational drill for DR site readiness.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members are requested to participate actively in the mock session to verify connectivity to the DR site
- No system-level changes are required at the member end
- Members should monitor www.nseindia.com for any new or revised announcements related to the February 28, 2026 mock session

## Important Dates

- **February 27, 2026**: Circular issued
- **February 28, 2026**: Mock bidding session from DR site (10:00 hrs – 17:00 hrs)

## Impact Assessment

This is a low-impact operational exercise. It affects NSE members participating in the eIPO platform and is intended solely to validate DR site connectivity and readiness. No real trades, funds, or securities are at risk. The mock security (MCKGS) is a dummy instrument used exclusively for testing purposes.
