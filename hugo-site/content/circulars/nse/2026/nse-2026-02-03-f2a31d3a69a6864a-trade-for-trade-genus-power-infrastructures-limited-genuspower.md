## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Movement to T2T segment significantly impacts trading patterns by eliminating intraday trading opportunities. This typically reduces liquidity and trading volumes as only delivery-based transactions are permitted.

**Market Participants**: Day traders and intraday speculators will be unable to trade this stock. Only investors willing to take delivery can participate.

**Liquidity**: Expected reduction in trading volumes and liquidity due to T2T restrictions and call auction mechanism.

**Price Discovery**: Call auction in pre-open session provides transparent price discovery mechanism and reduces volatility during market opening.

**Reason**: The change is pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement, indicating corporate restructuring activities that warrant enhanced surveillance and delivery-based trading to ensure orderly market conditions.
