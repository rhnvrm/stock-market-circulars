---

## Summary

NSE's Listing Department has notified all exchange members that the ISIN code for the equity shares of Varvee Global Limited (Symbol: VGL) will be changed effective March 02, 2026. The change is a result of a sub-division of the company's shares from a face value of Rs. 10/- per share to Rs. 5/- per share.

## Key Points

- The ISIN for Varvee Global Limited (VGL) is being changed as a result of a share sub-division.
- Old face value: Rs. 10/- per share; New face value: Rs. 5/- per share.
- New ISIN assigned: **INE273D01027**.
- The new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date, i.e., **March 02, 2026**.
- Circular Reference: NSE/CML/73009 | Circular Ref. No: 0325/2026.

## Regulatory Changes

The ISIN code for VGL equity shares is being updated in the NSE system to reflect the corporate action (share sub-division). All trading, clearing, and settlement activity on and after the ex-date must reference the new ISIN INE273D01027.

## Compliance Requirements

- All exchange members must update their trading and back-office systems to use the new ISIN (INE273D01027) for Varvee Global Limited (VGL) effective March 02, 2026.
- Members should ensure their clients' depository accounts are updated accordingly in coordination with the relevant depository participants.
- Any pending orders or positions in VGL must be reviewed and reconciled against the new ISIN prior to the ex-date.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Ex-Date / Effective Date for New ISIN:** March 02, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The share sub-division will double the number of outstanding equity shares of Varvee Global Limited while halving the face value, which typically results in increased liquidity and affordability of the stock. Members, custodians, and depository participants must ensure seamless transition to the new ISIN to avoid settlement failures. Systems that reference the old ISIN after the ex-date may face trade rejection or settlement discrepancies. The impact is moderate, confined to operational and back-office updates for those holding or trading VGL shares.
