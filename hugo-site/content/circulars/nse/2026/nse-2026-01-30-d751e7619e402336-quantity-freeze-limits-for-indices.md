The limits are computed as per the methodology specified in F&O consolidated circular NSE/FAOP/67775 dated April 30, 2025. Members must update their trading applications with new contract files before the effective date.

## Regulatory Changes

MIDCPNIFTY has the highest freeze limit at 2,800 contracts, while BANKNIFTY and NIFTYNXT50 have the lowest at 600 contracts each. NIFTY and FINNIFTY maintain identical limits at 1,800 contracts. Members must ensure timely system updates to avoid order rejections on the effective date.
