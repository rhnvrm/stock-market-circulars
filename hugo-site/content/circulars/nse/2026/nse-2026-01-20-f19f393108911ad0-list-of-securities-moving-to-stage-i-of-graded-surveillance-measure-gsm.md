## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: January 20, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 21, 2026
- **Reference Circulars**: NSE/SURV/34262 (Feb 23, 2017), NSE/SURV/38389 (Jul 20, 2018), NSE/SURV/42790 (Nov 29, 2019), NSE/SURV/59425 (Nov 17, 2023), NSE/SURV/64066 (Sep 20, 2024), NSE/SURV/71670 (Dec 5, 2025)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Stage I GSM placement significantly restricts trading by requiring 100% upfront margin, which may reduce liquidity and trading volumes in SKIL Infrastructure Limited. The 5% price band limits daily price movement.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors will face higher capital requirements to trade this security. The surveillance measure signals potential concerns about price volatility, liquidity issues, or corporate governance matters.

**Market Signal**: Placement under GSM indicates the exchange has identified concerns requiring enhanced surveillance. If conditions do not improve, the security may progress to more restrictive stages (II, III, or IV) with additional requirements including trade-for-trade settlement, weekly trading restrictions, and Additional Surveillance Deposits.

**GSM Framework Progression**: The four-stage framework escalates from Stage I (100% margin, 5% band) through Stage IV (trade-for-trade, weekly trading only, 100% ASD, no upward movement allowed), providing graduated enforcement based on surveillance concerns.
