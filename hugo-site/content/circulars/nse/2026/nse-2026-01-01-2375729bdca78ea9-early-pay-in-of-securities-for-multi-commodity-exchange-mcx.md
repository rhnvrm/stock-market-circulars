## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued instructions for early pay-in (EPI) of securities for Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) undergoing a face value split from Rs 10 per share to Rs 2 per share. The circular provides specific procedures for handling early pay-in during the corporate action period, with record date and ex-date on January 2, 2026.

## Key Points

- MCX (ISIN: INE745G01035) is undergoing face value split from Rs 10/- to Rs 2/- per share

- For January 2, 2026 (settlement 2026002): use old ISIN
- For January 5, 2026 (settlements 2026002 & 2026003): use new ISIN for settlement 2026003
- Conversion ratio: For sale of 10 shares, early pay-in should be 2 shares in old ISIN
- Block mechanism provisions apply as per SEBI circular requirements
- Custodians using pool accounts must upload client-wise allocation details based on actual traded quantity

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements existing early pay-in framework (NCL/CMPT/67751 dated April 29, 2025) for the specific MCX corporate action.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Members/Trading Participants**: Execute early pay-in in old ISIN (INE745G01035) for trades on January 2 and 5, 2026 without adjusting for conversion ratio
- **Block Mechanism**: Members must adhere to NCL circular NCL/CMPT/53386 dated August 22, 2022 regarding block mechanism in client demat accounts
- **Client-wise Allocation**: When using block mechanism for early pay-in, do NOT upload client-wise allocation file
- **Custodians**: Must upload client-wise early pay-in allocation details based on actual traded quantity (not adjusted quantity) when providing EPI through pool accounts
- **Post-Record Date**: All participants must use new ISIN for pay-in/early pay-in instructions after the record date

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: January 2, 2026
- **Ex-Date**: January 2, 2026
- **EPI Date 1**: January 2, 2026 (Settlement Number 2026002) - Use old ISIN
- **EPI Date 2**: January 5, 2026 (Settlement Numbers 2026002 & 2026003) - Old ISIN for 2026002, New ISIN for 2026003

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Members and custodians handling MCX securities must carefully manage the transition between old and new ISIN during the settlement period. The 5:1 split ratio requires precise calculation to ensure correct quantity delivery in the old ISIN format.

**Market Impact**: Limited to participants trading MCX securities during the corporate action period. Incorrect early pay-in procedures could result in settlement failures or margin calculation issues.

**Client Impact**: Clients selling MCX shares during this period should be informed about the corporate action to avoid confusion regarding settlement quantities and ISIN references.
