## Impact Assessment

This is a standard IPO listing notification for Shree Ram Twistex Limited, a Gujarat-based textile company. With an issue price of Rs. 104/- and a total of 3,99,75,000 shares, the IPO represents a moderate-sized listing. Approximately 29,375,000 shares (73.5%) are subject to lock-in periods ranging from September 2026 to March 2029, indicating significant promoter/anchor holding restrictions. Only 10,600,000 shares (~26.5%) are freely tradeable from listing date, which may affect early liquidity. Members and investors should factor in the lock-in schedule when assessing float and trading volumes post-listing.
