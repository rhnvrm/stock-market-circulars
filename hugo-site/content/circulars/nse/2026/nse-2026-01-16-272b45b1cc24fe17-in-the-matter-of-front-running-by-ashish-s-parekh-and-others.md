## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - This enforcement action reinforces SEBI's zero-tolerance approach to front running and market manipulation. The involvement of 13 entities in a coordinated front running scheme highlights the severity of the violation and sends a strong deterrent message to market participants.

**Regulatory Impact:** High - Demonstrates SEBI's enhanced surveillance capabilities in detecting complex front running arrangements involving multiple information carriers and front runners. The action strengthens market integrity by holding both information leakers and beneficiaries accountable.

**Investor Impact:** Positive - Protects interests of large institutional clients and investors by ensuring their trading information remains confidential and is not exploited for unfair gains. Enhances investor confidence in market fairness.

**Operational Impact:** Market intermediaries and brokers need to strengthen internal controls, information barriers, and surveillance systems to prevent unauthorized access to and misuse of client trading information. Enhanced compliance monitoring required for detecting similar patterns.
