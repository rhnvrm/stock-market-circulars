## Compliance Requirements

- Members must use designated security codes for trading in these securities
- Trading must be in specified lot sizes (market lot of 1 for all)
- Arihant Capital Markets preferential shares carry a lock-in expiry of September 5, 2027
- ICICI Bank bonus shares (227 shares previously in abeyance) are now freely tradeable with no lock-in

## Important Dates

- **February 27, 2026**: Effective date for admission of all further securities to dealings on NSE
- **February 21, 2026**: Allotment date for ABCAPITAL ESOP shares
- **February 24, 2026**: Allotment date for AXISBANK ESOP shares
- **January 21, 2026**: Allotment date for JSWENERGY preferential shares
- **November 22, 2025**: Allotment date for ARIHANTCAP preferential shares
- **September 5, 2027**: Lock-in expiry for ARIHANTCAP preferential shares

## Impact Assessment

The impact is routine and incremental. ESOP allotments for ABCAPITAL (9.7 lakh shares) and AXISBANK (2.6 lakh shares) represent minor dilution. JSW Energy's preferential allotment of ~95.2 lakh shares at Rs. 525 is the most significant addition in volume terms, having been allotted in January 2026. The resolution of 227 ICICI Bank bonus shares held in abeyance since 2017 is negligible. ARIHANTCAP preferential shares remain locked in until September 2027 and will not be available for trading. No unusual market impact is expected.
