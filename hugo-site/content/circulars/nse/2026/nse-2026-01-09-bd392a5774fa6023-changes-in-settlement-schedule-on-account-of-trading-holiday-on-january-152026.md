  2026
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has revised the settlement schedule for the Currency Derivatives Segment for January 2026 due to a trading holiday on January 15, 2026. This circular partially modifies the earlier settlement schedule issued on December 22, 2025.

## Key Points

- Settlement date for trades executed on January 14, 2026 has been revised
- Original settlement date: January 15, 2026
- Revised settlement date: January 16, 2026
- Change is due to trading holiday on January 15, 2026
- Applies to Currency Derivatives Segment only

## Regulatory Changes

This circular partially modifies NSE Clearing circular NCL/CD/71929 dated December 22, 2025, which originally published the settlement schedule for January 2026. The revision is made in reference to NSE circular NSE/CD/72233 dated January 09, 2026.

## Compliance Requirements

All members of the Currency Derivatives Segment must:
- Update their settlement calendars to reflect the revised settlement date
- Ensure trades executed on January 14, 2026 are settled on January 16, 2026 instead of January 15, 2026
- Adjust internal systems and processes accordingly

## Important Dates

- **Trade Date**: January 14, 2026
- **Original Settlement Date**: January 15, 2026 (Holiday)
- **Revised Settlement Date**: January 16, 2026
- **Circular Issue Date**: January 09, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this change is minimal and procedural in nature. The one-day shift in settlement date is a standard adjustment made to accommodate the trading holiday. Members have adequate notice to adjust their settlement processes. This affects only Currency Derivatives Segment participants and does not impact trading activities, only the settlement timeline for trades executed on January 14, 2026.
