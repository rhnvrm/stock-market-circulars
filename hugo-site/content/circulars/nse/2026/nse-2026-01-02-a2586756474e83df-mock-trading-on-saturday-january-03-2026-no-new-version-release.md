**Technical Impact**: Members need to upgrade to NEAT+ version 7.8.7 before the mock session. System testing includes both primary and disaster recovery site operations, ensuring business continuity preparedness.

**Market Impact**: None - This is a testing session with no financial obligations. No actual fund movements or settlement obligations arise from mock trades.

**Compliance Impact**: Members must ensure UCC/PAN compliance is updated before the session. The mock session also serves regulatory requirements per SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD1/DSAP/CIR/P/2020/234 for software testing through either mock trading or simulated environment.
