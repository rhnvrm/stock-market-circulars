title: Connectivity - POP Network Changes - Extension for Delhi Self-Service Links
---

## Summary

NSE has extended the migration deadline for self-service connectivity links from the existing Jivan Vihar POP to the new Sify Okhla POP in Delhi until January 31, 2026. This extension is granted due to a substantial number of self-service links still pending migration, despite progress made. The existing Delhi POP (Jivan Vihar) will be discontinued after January 31, 2026. Note that the Kolkata POP (STT Ultadanga) migration remains on original schedule with no extension mentioned.

## Key Points

- Migration timeline extended only for self-service links at Delhi POP (Jivan Vihar)
- New deadline: End of Day, January 31, 2026
- Previous deadline was January 9, 2026
- Extension granted due to substantial count of pending migrations
- New POP location: Sify Okhla (Delhi)
- Old POP location: Jivan Vihar (Delhi)
- Managed service links migration status not specified in this circular
- Migration originally announced on August 5, 2025
- Telecom Network Integrator (TNI) Sify will discontinue the old POP after the extended deadline

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational infrastructure update with an extended timeline for compliance.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members with self-service connectivity links subscribed from Jivan Vihar POP must complete migration to Sify Okhla POP
- Migration must be completed by EOD January 31, 2026
- Members should coordinate with Sify using the provided escalation matrix:
  - NOC escalation for post-commissioning issues: 18004199963 / 044-61332900, nse.servicedesk@sifycorp.com
  - Onsite team for new application requests: 8655258060 / 9773701152, onsite_nse@sifycorp.com
- Members can refer to Aakash Portal for additional information from Sify

## Important Dates

- **January 9, 2026**: Original discontinuation date for Jivan Vihar POP (now extended)
- **January 31, 2026**: Revised discontinuation date for Jivan Vihar POP - final deadline for migration
- **August 5, 2025**: Initial migration announcement date
- **November 7, 2025**: Follow-up circular (NSE/MSD/71183)
- **November 28, 2025**: Follow-up circular (NSE/MSD/71535)
- **December 9, 2025**: Follow-up circular (NSE/MSD/71715)
- **December 26, 2025**: Previous circular announcing January 9, 2026 deadline

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Members with self-service connectivity links from Jivan Vihar POP must take action to migrate to avoid service disruption. Failure to migrate by January 31, 2026 will result in connectivity loss as the old POP will be discontinued by Sify.

**Geographic Scope**: This extension applies specifically to Delhi region members using the Jivan Vihar POP. The circular does not mention any extension for Kolkata POP (STT Ultadanga) migrations.

**Member Action Required**: Members need to proactively coordinate with Sify to schedule and complete their link migration. A comprehensive escalation matrix with contact numbers and email addresses has been provided for different types of support needs.

**Timeline Pressure**: While the extension provides additional time (22 days), members should prioritize migration planning to avoid last-minute complications given that a substantial number of links remain pending.
