- **Stage I:** 100% applicable margin rate with 5% price band

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 20, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 23, 2026 (Stage III GSM restrictions take effect)

## Impact Assessment

The escalation of BLUECHIP to Stage III GSM significantly restricts trading activity and liquidity. The trade-for-trade mechanism eliminates the ability to net off positions, increasing settlement risk and capital requirements for traders. The 50% ASD requirement raises the cost of acquiring the security, likely suppressing buying interest. This measure signals heightened regulatory concern over the trading patterns or fundamentals of Blue Chip India Limited. Investors and traders holding or considering positions in this stock face substantially reduced flexibility and higher transaction costs.
