The market impact of this circular is negligible. Only 65 shares are being listed, a trivially small addition to Skipper Limited's total share capital. The conversion from partly paid-up to fully paid-up shares is a routine corporate action. The distinctive number range spans two tranches: one share (107021819–107021819) and 64 shares (107021819–112854195), totalling 65. No significant price or liquidity effect is expected for SKIPPER.
