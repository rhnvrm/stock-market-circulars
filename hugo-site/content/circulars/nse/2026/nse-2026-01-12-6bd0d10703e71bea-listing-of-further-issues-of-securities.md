## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The further issues represent routine additions of shares through ESOP exercises and preferential allotments. The quantities are relatively small compared to existing share capital for most companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in tradable float except for Indo Thai Securities (1.75 million shares), though these remain under lock-in until August 2026. ESOP allotments have no lock-in restrictions.

**Operational Impact**: Standard listing procedures. Trading members need to update their systems with new distinctive number ranges for these securities.

**Investor Impact**: No material dilution expected. ESOP issuances are typical employee compensation instruments. Preferential allotments are subject to lock-in periods, preventing immediate market sale.
