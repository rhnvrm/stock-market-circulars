## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The OFS of Hindustan Zinc Limited represents a significant equity offering with potential volume of up to 6.7 crore shares (including oversubscription option), valued at approximately Rs. 4,589 crores at floor price. This large-scale offering may impact HINDZINC stock liquidity and price discovery during the bidding sessions.

**Trading Member Impact**: All Capital Market segment trading members can participate, but must ensure strict compliance with UCC requirements and admin user setup through ENIT portal. The day-prior compliance cutoff creates operational urgency for members and their clients.

**Operational Impact**: The implementation follows the Interoperability among Clearing Corporations scheme, requiring members to be familiar with eOFS platform functionality, margin requirements for carry-forward orders, and two-category bidding structure (retail vs. non-retail). Members should refer to Annexure 3 of circular NSE/CMTR/43529 dated February 13, 2020, for features and limit settings.

**Investor Impact**: Retail investors (bid value ≤ Rs. 2 lakhs) have dedicated RS series access, with low entry barrier of 1 share market lot and small tick size of Re. 0.05, enabling broad participation in the OFS.
