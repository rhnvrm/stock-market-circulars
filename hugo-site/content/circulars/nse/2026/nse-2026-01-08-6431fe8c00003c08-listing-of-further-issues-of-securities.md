## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. ESOP allotments are routine corporate actions that typically have negligible impact on stock prices or trading volumes. The quantities being listed are relatively small compared to the total issued capital of these companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in tradable shares for the listed companies. The largest allotment is 248,641 shares for AU Small Finance Bank, which represents a small fraction of its total equity base.

**Trading Impact**: No restrictions on trading as there are no lock-in requirements. Shares are immediately available for trading and rank pari passu with existing shares, ensuring no dilution of voting or economic rights.

**Investor Impact**: ESOP exercises are generally viewed positively as they indicate employee confidence in the company. However, given the small quantities, no significant market reaction is expected.
