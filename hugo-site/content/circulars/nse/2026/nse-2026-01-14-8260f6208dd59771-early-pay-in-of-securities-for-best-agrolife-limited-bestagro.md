title: Early Pay-in of Securities for Best Agrolife Limited (BESTAGRO) - Face Value
  Split
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued guidelines for early pay-in of securities for Best Agrolife Limited (BESTAGRO) in connection with a face value split from Rs 10 per share to Re 1 per share. Members and custodians must follow specific procedures for handling early pay-in using old and new ISINs during the transition period around the record date of January 16, 2026.

## Key Points

- Face value split from Rs 10 per share to Re 1 per share (1:10 ratio)
- Old ISIN: INE052T01013
- Record Date and Ex-Date: January 16, 2026
- Early pay-in on January 16, 2026 (Settlement 2026012) must use old/existing ISIN
- Early pay-in on January 19, 2026 uses both old ISIN (Settlement 2026012) and new ISIN (Settlement 2026013)
- For sale of 10 shares, early pay-in must be made for 1 share in old ISIN
- Block mechanism applies as per SEBI circular (NCL/CMPT/53386 dated August 22, 2022)
- Client-wise early pay-in allocation file should not be uploaded when using block mechanism
- Custodians using pool accounts must upload client-wise allocation details based on actual traded quantity

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements existing early pay-in framework (Item 10.18 of consolidated circular NCL/CMPT/67751 dated April 29, 2025) for a specific corporate action scenario.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Members/Custodians**: Execute early pay-in instructions in old ISIN (INE052T01013) for trades on ex-date/record date without adjusting for conversion ratio
- **Market Participants**: Adhere to block mechanism requirements for client demat accounts during sale transactions
- **Market Participants using Block Mechanism**: Do not upload client-wise early pay-in allocation file
- **Custodians with Pool Accounts**: Must upload client-wise early pay-in allocation details reflecting actual traded quantity (not adjusted quantity)
- **Post-Record Date**: Execute all pay-in/early pay-in instructions in new ISIN after January 16, 2026

## Important Dates

- **January 16, 2026**: Record Date and Ex-Date for face value split
- **January 16, 2026**: Early pay-in date for Settlement 2026012 (use old ISIN)
- **January 19, 2026**: Early pay-in date for Settlements 2026012 (old ISIN) and 2026013 (new ISIN)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Members and custodians dealing with BESTAGRO securities must implement specific ISIN handling procedures during the transition period. The requirement to use old ISIN with adjusted quantities (1:10 ratio) for early pay-in creates operational complexity requiring system adjustments and careful attention to settlement numbers.

**Market Impact**: Limited to participants trading BESTAGRO securities around the record date. The early pay-in facility allows margin exemption benefits to continue during the corporate action, supporting normal trading activity.

**Risk Considerations**: Incorrect ISIN usage or quantity adjustments could result in settlement failures. Clear communication to operations teams and clients is essential to ensure smooth processing during the transition period.
