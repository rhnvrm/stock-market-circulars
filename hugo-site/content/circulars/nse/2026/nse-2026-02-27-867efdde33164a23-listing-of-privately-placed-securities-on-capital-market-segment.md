## Impact Assessment

| Company | Symbol | Coupon | Maturity | ISIN |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Profectus Capital Private Limited | 9PCPL28B | 9.00% | 26-Feb-2028 | INE389Z07112 |
| IFL Finance Limited | 1180IFL28 | 11.80% | 26-Feb-2028 | INE01XO07041 |

This is a routine operational listing circular with low broad market impact. The admission provides liquidity and secondary market access for holders of these privately placed bonds. Sundaram Finance (a publicly listed NBFC) carries higher investor recognition; its 7.24% bond reflects investment-grade pricing. IFL Finance's 11.80% coupon indicates a higher-risk profile relative to peers. Members dealing in debt instruments should update their trading systems prior to March 02, 2026.
