## Summary

The Government of Singapore, a public unitholder of IndiGrid Infrastructure Trust (InvIT), has notified stock exchanges of its intention to sell units through the Offer for Sale (OFS) mechanism. The base offer consists of 4,36,31,371 units representing 4.58% of IndiGrid's unit capital, with an oversubscription option to sell an additional 2,64,59,185 units (2.78%). If fully exercised, the total offering would be 7,00,90,556 units representing 7.36% of the InvIT's unit capital. The OFS will be conducted through a designated window on BSE and NSE.

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. The OFS is being conducted in accordance with existing regulations:

- SEBI Master Circular for Stock Exchanges bearing number SEBI/HO/MRD-PoD2/CIR/P/2024/00181 dated December 30, 2024

## Important Dates

- **February 04, 2026**: Notice date - announcement of proposed OFS
- **February 05, 2026 (T Day)**: First day of OFS - for non-retail investors only
- **February 06, 2026 (T+1 Day)**: Second day of OFS - for retail investors and non-retail investors with unallotted bids carried forward

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Potential supply of up to 7.36% of IndiGrid's outstanding units may create selling pressure
- Two-tiered offering (non-retail first, then retail) allows institutional price discovery before retail participation
- Government of Singapore's divestment signals possible portfolio rebalancing but doesn't indicate fundamental concerns

**Trading Impact:**
- Expected increased trading volumes on February 5-6, 2026
- Price volatility likely during OFS period
- Non-retail investors get priority access on T Day
- Retail investors and unallotted institutional bids processed on T+1 Day

**Investor Considerations:**
- Significant block available for acquisition by institutional and retail investors
- Oversubscription option provides flexibility to seller based on demand
- OFS mechanism ensures transparent price discovery through stock exchange platform
