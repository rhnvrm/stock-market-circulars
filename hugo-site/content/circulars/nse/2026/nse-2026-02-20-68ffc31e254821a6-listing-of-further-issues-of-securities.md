## Summary

NSE has notified the listing of further issues of equity shares for two SME EMERGE companies — Rox Hi Tech Limited and Womancart Limited — effective February 23, 2026. The listing covers shares allotted under an ESOP scheme (Rox Hi Tech) and through conversion of warrants issued on a preferential basis (Womancart).

- Rox Hi Tech Limited (ROXHITECH) is listing 1,01,338 equity shares allotted under ESOP on February 10, 2026, at a face value/paid-up value of Rs. 10 each.
- Womancart Limited (WOMANCART) is listing 3,18,000 equity shares at an issue price of Rs. 128 each (face value Rs. 10), allotted on November 27, 2025, pursuant to conversion of warrants issued on preferential basis.

- Womancart shares are pari passu with existing shares; lock-in expires on August 31, 2027.
- Equity shares have been credited under temporary ISIN (IN8*********) in accordance with SEBI circulars CIR/MRD/DP/21/2012 and CIR/MRD/DP/24/2012.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular is issued in pursuance of:
- Regulation 3.1.1 of the NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A (admission to dealings).
- Regulation 2.5.5 of the NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A (lot sizes).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading in these securities must use the designated security codes (ROXHITECH, WOMANCART) only.
- Trading must be conducted in the specified lot sizes: 1,600 for ROXHITECH and 400 for WOMANCART.
- Members must note the lock-in expiry date of August 31, 2027 for Womancart shares before facilitating transactions.

## Important Dates

- **February 10, 2026**: Date of allotment of Rox Hi Tech ESOP shares.
- **November 27, 2025**: Date of allotment of Womancart warrant-conversion shares.
- **February 23, 2026**: Effective date for admission to dealings on NSE for both securities.
- **August 31, 2027**: Lock-in expiry date for Womancart shares.

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited and routine in nature. The listing of further issues adds a modest number of shares to the float of two SME EMERGE companies. The Womancart shares carry a lock-in until August 2027, restricting near-term tradability of those shares. Rox Hi Tech's ESOP shares are freely tradable from the effective date. Members and participants dealing in SME EMERGE securities should update their systems with the new distinctive number ranges and lot sizes.
