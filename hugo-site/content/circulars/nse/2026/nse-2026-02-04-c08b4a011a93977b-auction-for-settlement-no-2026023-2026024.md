## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued a partial modification to the February 2026 settlement calendar for the Capital Market Segment. The circular revises the auction schedule for settlement numbers 2026023 and 2026024. Key changes include consolidation of shortages from both settlements into Auction A 2026024, cancellation of Auction A 2026023, and revised pay-in timings at the clearing corporation.

## Key Points

- Settlement M 2026023 (Trade Date: 03-Feb-26) and M 2026024 (Trade Date: 04-Feb-26) auction schedules revised
- Auction A 2026023 will not be conducted
- All shortages (CC and internal) from both M 2026023 and M 2026024 will be assigned to Auction A 2026024
- Auction A 2026024 trade date: 05-Feb-26, settlement date: 06-Feb-26
- Pay-in time for Auction 2026024 at CC: 08:00 AM
- Participants must note revised auction cut-off timings at depositories due to revised settlement time on February 6, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

This circular modifies the previously issued settlement calendar (NCL/CMPT/72228 dated January 09, 2026) for the Capital Market Segment covering T+1 and T+0 settlements.

## Compliance Requirements

- All Members, Custodians, and PCMs must adhere to the revised auction schedule
- Participants must prepare for consolidated shortage handling in Auction A 2026024
- Members must comply with the 08:00 AM pay-in time for Auction 2026024 at the clearing corporation
- Participants must note and comply with revised auction cut-off timings at depositories

## Important Dates

| Settlement | Trade Date | Custodial Confirmation | Settlement Date | Auction Settlement | Auction Trade Date | Auction Settlement Date | Pay-in Time |
|------------|------------|------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| M 2026023 | 03-Feb-26 | 04-Feb-26 | 04-Feb-26 | 2026024 | 05-Feb-26 | 06-Feb-26 | 08:00 AM |
| M 2026024 | 04-Feb-26 | 05-Feb-26 | 05-Feb-26 | 2026024 | 05-Feb-26 | 06-Feb-26 | 08:00 AM |

## Impact Assessment

This operational change affects clearing members, custodians, and PCMs by consolidating auction activities and eliminating one auction settlement. The consolidation of shortages into a single auction (A 2026024) may result in higher volumes for that auction session. Members need to adjust their operational processes to account for the cancelled A 2026023 auction and ensure timely compliance with the 08:00 AM pay-in deadline. The revised cut-off timings at depositories on February 6, 2026 require coordination between clearing members and their depository participants.
