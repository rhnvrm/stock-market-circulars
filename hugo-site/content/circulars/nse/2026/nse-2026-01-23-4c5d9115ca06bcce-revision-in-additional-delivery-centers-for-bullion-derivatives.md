title: Revision in Additional Delivery Centers for Bullion Derivatives
---

## Summary

NSE has revised the 'Additional Delivery Centers' parameter for bullion derivatives, removing Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai as additional delivery locations. The revision applies to Gold Futures, Gold Mini Futures, Silver Futures, and Silver Option on Goods contracts, effective from February 3, 2026.

## Key Points

- Additional delivery centers for bullion derivatives being eliminated (revised to NIL)
- Previously existing additional delivery centers: Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai
- Affects four bullion derivative products: Gold Futures, Gold Mini Futures, Silver Futures, and Silver Option on Goods
- Changes apply to contracts from February 2026 and March 2026 onwards depending on the product
- Effective implementation date: February 3, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

NSE is standardizing delivery procedures for bullion derivatives by removing the additional delivery center options. This means members will no longer have Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai as alternative delivery locations for these contracts.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must note the revised delivery center parameters
- Adjust operational and logistical arrangements for bullion derivative deliveries
- Ensure systems are updated to reflect the removal of additional delivery centers
- Plan for delivery obligations considering the elimination of alternative delivery locations

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: January 23, 2026
- **Implementation Date**: February 3, 2026
- **Gold Futures**: Applicable from March 2026 contracts onwards
- **Gold Mini Futures**: Applicable from March 2026 contracts onwards
- **Silver Futures**: Applicable from March 2026 contracts onwards
- **Silver Option on Goods**: Applicable from February 2026 contracts onwards

## Impact Assessment

This revision will impact members who have been utilizing Delhi, Mumbai, or Chennai as additional delivery centers for bullion derivatives. Members will need to adjust their delivery logistics and operational planning. The change may affect delivery convenience for participants located in or preferring these cities, potentially requiring adjustments to storage and transportation arrangements. The staggered implementation across different contract months allows time for operational adjustments.
