## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has revised the Market Wide Position Limit (MWPL) and position limits for Participants, Institutional clients, and Non-Institutional clients for the symbol AIIL in the Securities Lending and Borrowing Scheme. The new limits represent approximately a 5-fold increase across all categories and will be effective from January 14, 2026.

- Institutional client limit raised from 530,064 shares to 2,650,320 shares
- Participant limit increased from 530,064 shares to 2,650,320 shares
- Non-Institutional client limit revised from 53,006 shares to 265,032 shares
- Changes apply specifically to AIIL symbol in Securities Lending and Borrowing Scheme
- Revision is for the month of January 2026

## Regulatory Changes

This circular partially modifies circular NCL/CMPT/72105 dated December 31, 2025, and follows the framework established in circular NCL/CMPT/67763 dated April 30, 2025. The revision significantly expands position limits across all participant categories by approximately 5 times the previous limits.

## Compliance Requirements

- All Participants and Custodians must note the revised limits
- Updated limits must be implemented from January 14, 2026
- Participants should ensure their systems reflect the new position limits for AIIL
- Compliance with revised MWPL and client-specific limits is mandatory

## Important Dates

- Circular Issue Date: January 13, 2026
- Effective Date: January 14, 2026
- Applicable Period: January 2026

## Impact Assessment

The substantial increase in position limits (approximately 400% increase) suggests improved liquidity or increased available quantity for lending and borrowing of AIIL shares. This expansion allows institutional and non-institutional participants to take larger positions in the Securities Lending and Borrowing Scheme, potentially enhancing market depth and facilitating larger transactions. Participants trading AIIL should update their risk management systems and position monitoring tools to reflect these enhanced limits.
