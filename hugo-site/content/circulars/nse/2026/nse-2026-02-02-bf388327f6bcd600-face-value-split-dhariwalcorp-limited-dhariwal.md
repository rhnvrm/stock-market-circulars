## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The face value split will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5 times while proportionally reducing the market price. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors. The total market capitalization and shareholder value remain unchanged.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face value. Post-split, the stock price will adjust to approximately one-fifth of the pre-split price, with shareholders holding five times the number of shares.
