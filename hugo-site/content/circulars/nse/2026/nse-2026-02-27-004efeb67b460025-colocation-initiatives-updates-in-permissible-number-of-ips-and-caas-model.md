title: Colocation Initiatives - Updates in Permissible IPs and CaaS Model
---

## Summary

NSE's Member Service Department has announced updates to its colocation facility under Circular Ref. No. 10/2026 (Download Ref No: NSE/MSD/73068). The changes cover two areas: an increase in the maximum number of permissible Interactive IPs across all rack variants, and significant relaxations to the Colocation-as-a-Service (CaaS) framework, including removal of multiple restrictions on members and vendors.

## Key Points

- Maximum permissible Interactive IPs increased for all rack variants: HPD (2×60 → 2×80), Full Rack (60 → 80), Half Rack (30 → 40), Quarter Rack (15 → 20)
- CaaS vendors may now apply for any rack variant (HPD, Full, Half, or Quarter) based on business requirements
- Per-rack member limits for CaaS discontinued: previously max 60 members per Full Rack and 30 per Half Rack
- Restriction limiting members to contracts with a maximum of 2 CaaS vendors at any time is discontinued
- Limit of 4 order connectivities per member-CaaS vendor combination is discontinued
- The exclusive-choice directive (independent rack OR CaaS vendor) is discontinued with immediate effect, allowing members to use both simultaneously

## Regulatory Changes

These changes partially modify section II.A and section IV of Exchange circular NSE/MSD/67756 dated April 29, 2025 (the colocation consolidated circular). The following restrictions are formally discontinued:

1. Maximum member-per-rack limits under the CaaS framework (60 per Full Rack, 30 per Half Rack)
2. The one-contract/maximum-two-vendor restriction for members availing CaaS services
3. The cap of 4 order connectivities per member-CaaS vendor combination
4. The directive requiring members to choose exclusively between an independent rack or CaaS vendor

All other provisions of NSE/MSD/67756 remain unchanged.

## Compliance Requirements

- Colocation participants and CaaS vendors should note the revised IP limits and updated CaaS framework immediately
- Members wishing to apply for additional IPs or new rack variants under the revised framework must await a separate circular that will communicate the rollout timeline and digital acceptance process
- Members may now hold both an independent rack and a CaaS vendor arrangement concurrently; no action is required to exercise this flexibility
- CaaS participants must continue to adhere to maximum power consumption limits set by the Exchange

## Important Dates

- **February 27, 2026**: Circular issued; discontinuation of the exclusive-choice directive (independent rack vs. CaaS) takes effect immediately
- **TBD**: Rollout timeline and digital acceptance process for IP limit increases and CaaS framework changes will be communicated via a separate circular

## Impact Assessment

This circular benefits colocation participants and CaaS vendors by materially increasing operational flexibility. The IP limit increases (33% uplift across all rack variants) allow higher-density deployments without requiring rack upgrades. Removing the member-per-rack and vendor-contract caps reduces friction for both vendors scaling their CaaS businesses and members diversifying colocation arrangements. The elimination of the exclusive-choice rule is particularly significant as it allows members to run hybrid setups. These changes are expected to improve competitiveness and capacity utilization within NSE's colocation facility.
