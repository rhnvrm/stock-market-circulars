---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has notified the settlement schedules for the Mutual Fund Service System (MFSS) for February 2026. The circular provides detailed calendars for three settlement types: regular subscription (Settlement Type 'S'), liquid subscription (Settlement Type 'K'), and redemption (Settlement Type 'U'). Settlement numbers range from 20260202 to 20260241 for February 2026.

## Key Points

- Settlement schedules cover three types: Subscription (T+1), Liquid Subscription (T day), and Redemption
- MFSS Subscription follows T+1 settlement cycle where T is the transaction date
- Liquid Subscription settles on T day itself for same-day units allocation
- Redemption settlement varies by scheme category (T+1 to T+8 depending on fund type)
- No liquid settlement on February 19, 2026 due to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti
- Category codes for scheme classifications provided in Annexure 'D'

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine operational calendar notification.

## Compliance Requirements

- All MFSS participants must follow the published settlement schedules
- Participants must check scheme category in scheme master to determine applicable settlement day
- Funds settlement for subscription orders depends on the fund's settlement day for the scheme category
- Redemption funds settlement follows scheme category payout guidelines (T+1 through T+8)

## Important Dates

- **February 19, 2026**: No liquid settlement (Holiday - Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti)
