  on Sunday, February 01, 2026 - Union Budget
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a modified schedule for reporting holding statements due to the live trading session on Sunday, February 01, 2026, coinciding with the Union Budget presentation. Trading members must comply with revised due dates for reporting holding statements for trades executed between January 30 and February 02, 2026.

## Key Points

- Live trading session scheduled on Sunday, February 01, 2026 due to Union Budget presentation
- Modified reporting schedule applies to holding statements for specified trade dates
- Multiple trade dates consolidated to single reporting due dates
- Circular issued by Inspection Department (Ref: 06/2026)

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a temporary operational adjustment for the special trading session during Union Budget presentation.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must report holding statements according to the revised schedule
- All trading members are required to comply with the modified deadlines
- Members should contact regional offices or central help desk for clarifications

## Important Dates

- **January 30, 2026**: Trade date - Reporting due on February 02, 2026
- **January 31, 2026**: Trade date - Reporting due on February 02, 2026

### Reporting Schedule Table

| Reporting for Trade Date | Due Date |
|--------------------------|----------|
| 30-Jan-2026 | 02-Feb-2026 |
| 31-Jan-2026 | 02-Feb-2026 |
| 01-Feb-2026 | 02-Feb-2026 |
| 02-Feb-2026 | 03-Feb-2026 |

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to adjust their reporting processes to accommodate the Sunday trading session and consolidated reporting deadlines. Three consecutive trade dates (Jan 30, 31, Feb 01) will have the same reporting due date of February 02, 2026, which may increase the reporting workload on that day.

**Market Impact**: Minimal direct market impact. This is primarily an administrative and compliance matter affecting back-office operations of trading members.

**Member Impact**: Trading members must ensure their compliance teams are aware of the modified schedule and have adequate resources to meet the consolidated reporting deadline on February 02, 2026.
