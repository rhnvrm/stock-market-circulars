## Summary

NSE has issued updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective January 27-28, 2026. Kapston Services Limited is being included in ESM Stage-I, requiring 100% margin and shifting to Trade-for-Trade segment. Four securities (GSTL, PROZONER, SALSTEEL, TVSELECT) are moving from ESM Stage-II to Stage-I, indicating reduced surveillance. Securities under ESM will be shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST), and Stage-II securities will operate under Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band.

## Key Points

- Kapston Services Limited added to ESM Stage-I effective January 28, 2026
- Minimum 100% margin requirement on all open positions as of January 27, 2026 and new positions from January 28, 2026
- Securities shifting from EQ/SM series to BE/ST series (Trade-for-Trade) effective January 28, 2026
- Stage-II securities under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction from January 27, 2026
- Four securities (GSTL, PROZONER, SALSTEEL, TVSELECT) moving from Stage-II to Stage-I
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures
- ESM shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

Securities qualifying under ESM undergo the following regulatory changes:

- **Segment Change**: Shift from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST)
- **Margin Requirements**: Minimum 100% margin applicable on positions
- **Price Band**: Stage-II securities subject to 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- **Trading Mechanism**: Stage-II securities operate under Periodic Call Auction mechanism
- Securities moving out of ESM framework will have their original price bands reinstated, unless subject to other surveillance measures

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure 100% margin is maintained for securities under ESM Stage-I
- Trading members must comply with Trade-for-Trade settlement requirements for affected securities
- Existing open positions in affected securities as of January 27, 2026 will require 100% margin from January 28, 2026
- All new positions created from January 28, 2026 onwards will attract 100% margin requirement
- Members should review their positions in affected securities and ensure adequate margins

## Important Dates

- **January 23, 2026**: Circular issued (Circular Ref. No: 60/2026)
- **January 27, 2026**: Stage-II securities shift to Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- **January 27, 2026**: Last date for existing positions before margin requirement applies
- **January 28, 2026**: 100% margin requirement effective on all positions
- **January 28, 2026**: Securities shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST series (Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Reduced liquidity for affected securities due to Trade-for-Trade settlement
- Higher margin requirements (100%) will increase capital costs for traders holding positions
- 2% price band restriction on Stage-II securities limits price movement and volatility

**Trading Impact:**
- Intraday trading eliminated for securities shifted to Trade-for-Trade segment
- Delivery-based trading only for affected securities
- Potential reduction in trading volumes due to increased margin requirements

**Operational Impact:**
- Traders with existing positions in KAPSTON must arrange 100% margin by January 28, 2026
- Positive development for GSTL, PROZONER, SALSTEEL, and TVSELECT as they move from stricter Stage-II to Stage-I surveillance
- Settlement obligations change from T+1 rolling to delivery-based for affected securities

**Investor Considerations:**
- ESM designation is for surveillance purposes and not a negative reflection on company fundamentals
- Higher entry barriers due to margin requirements may deter speculative trading
