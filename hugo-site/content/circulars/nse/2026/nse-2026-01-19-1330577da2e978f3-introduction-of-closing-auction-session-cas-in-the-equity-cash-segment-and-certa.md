title: Introduction of Closing Auction Session (CAS) in Equity Cash Segment
---

## Summary

SEBI has introduced a Closing Auction Session (CAS) for stocks in the equity cash segment on which derivative contracts are available. The closing price will now be determined through a 20-minute auction session from 3:15 PM to 3:35 PM, replacing the current Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) method based on last 30 minutes of trading. This change aligns Indian markets with global best practices and improves price discovery for settlement in derivatives, index computation, and mutual fund NAV determination.

## Key Points

- CAS will be implemented in phased manner, initially applicable only to stocks with derivative contracts
- 20-minute auction session from 3:15 PM to 3:35 PM on all trading days
- Four distinct phases: reference price calculation (5 mins), order entry for all orders (5 mins), limit orders only with random close (5 mins), and order matching (5 mins)
- Random closure of order entry between 3:28 PM to 3:30 PM to prevent gaming
- Equity derivatives segment will continue till 3:40 PM
- Post-close session shifted to 3:50 PM - 4:00 PM for trades at closing price
- Remaining securities will continue using VWAP method for closing price determination
- Provides fair and transparent closing price reflecting collective market consensus
- Facilitates passive funds to transact at closing price, reducing tracking error

## Regulatory Changes

**Current System:**
- Closing price determined by VWAP of trades in last 30 minutes of Continuous Trading Session

**New System (for derivative stocks):**
- Closing price determined through Closing Auction Session
- CAS aggregates market interest into single pool of liquidity
- Equal and transparent access to all investor categories

**Session Structure:**
1. **3:15 PM - 3:20 PM (5 mins):** Reference price calculation and transition from CTS to CAS
2. **3:20 PM - 3:25 PM (5 mins):** Order entry period for both limit and market orders
3. **3:25 PM - 3:30 PM (5 mins):** Only limit orders allowed, no modification/cancellation for market orders, random close in last 2 minutes
4. **3:30 PM - 3:35 PM (5 mins):** Order matching

## Compliance Requirements

**Stock Exchanges must:**
- Implement CAS infrastructure and systems for 20-minute auction session
- Enable random closure mechanism between 3:28 PM - 3:30 PM
- Adjust post-close session timings to 3:50 PM - 4:00 PM
- Apply same CAS framework to special trading sessions

**Clearing Corporations must:**
- Update settlement systems to use CAS-determined closing prices for derivative stocks
- Coordinate with exchanges on implementation

**Market Participants should:**
- Adjust trading strategies to account for new closing price mechanism
- Update order management systems for CAS participation
- Prepare for phased implementation starting with derivative stocks

**Mutual Funds and Passive Funds:**
- Can transact at closing price during CAS
- Benefit from reduced tracking error
- Update NAV calculation processes

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** January 16, 2026
- **Implementation Date:** To be announced by Stock Exchanges (phased implementation)
- **Initial Phase:** Applicable to stocks with derivative contracts
- **Future Phases:** Extension to remaining securities to be notified separately

## Impact Assessment

**Market Structure Impact:**
- Significant change to price discovery mechanism for derivative stocks

- NAV determination based on CAS closing prices
- Passive funds can transact at closing price, reducing tracking error
- Better alignment with benchmark indices

**Operational Impact:**
- Market participants need to adjust order submission strategies
- Systems and algorithms need updates for new session structure
- Random closure mechanism prevents gaming and ensures fair participation

**Global Alignment:**
