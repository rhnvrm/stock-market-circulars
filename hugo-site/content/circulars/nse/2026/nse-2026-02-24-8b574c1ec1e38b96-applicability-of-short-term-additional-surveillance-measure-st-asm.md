title: Applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) - February
  2026
---

## Summary

NSE has issued Circular No. 143/2026 (Download Ref No: NSE/SURV/72960) dated February 24, 2026, identifying securities for inclusion, movement, and exclusion under the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective February 25–26, 2026. Three securities are newly added to ST-ASM Stage I, one security moves from Stage II back to Stage I, and Stage II has no new inclusions.

## Key Points

- Three securities — AFIL, DEEDEV, and REXPIPES — have been shortlisted for inclusion under ST-ASM Stage I effective February 25, 2026.
- No securities have been shortlisted for ST-ASM Stage II inclusion.
- No securities are moving from Stage I to Stage II.
- OMFURN (Omfurn India Limited) moves from ST-ASM Stage II to Stage I effective February 25, 2026.
- ST-ASM Stage I margin: 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher (capped at 100%), applicable from February 26, 2026.
- ST-ASM Stage II margin: 100% or existing margin, whichever is higher (capped at 100%), applicable from February 26, 2026.
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures.
- Shortlisting under ASM is purely for market surveillance purposes and should not be construed as an adverse action against the concerned company.

## Regulatory Changes

This circular is issued further to earlier ASM circulars: NSE/SURV/39265 (October 27, 2018), NSE/SURV/46557 (December 4, 2020), NSE/SURV/52144 (April 28, 2022), NSE/SURV/58558 (September 25, 2023), and NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024). The ST-ASM framework continues to apply enhanced margin requirements to securities meeting specific surveillance criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must apply the enhanced margin requirements for the affected securities from February 26, 2026.
- For ST-ASM Stage I securities (AFIL, DEEDEV, REXPIPES): collect margin at 50% or existing applicable margin, whichever is higher (maximum 100%), on all open positions as of February 25, 2026 and all new positions from February 26, 2026.
- For ST-ASM Stage II securities: collect margin at 100% or existing applicable margin, whichever is higher (maximum 100%).
- Members should note OMFURN's downgrade from Stage II to Stage I and adjust margin collection accordingly.
- Members may refer to NSE FAQs on ASM at https://www.nseindia.com/regulations/additional-surveillance-measure for further details.
- Queries can be directed to surveillance@nse.co.in.

## Important Dates

- **February 24, 2026**: Circular issued.
- **February 25, 2026**: Effective date for inclusion/movement of securities into respective ST-ASM stages.
- **February 26, 2026**: Enhanced margin requirements come into force for all open positions (as of Feb 25, 2026) and new positions in affected securities.

## Impact Assessment

**AFIL (Akme Fintrade (India) Limited | INE916Y01027)**: Added to ST-ASM Stage I. Trading costs increase due to 50% minimum margin requirement, likely to reduce liquidity and increase volatility.

**DEEDEV (DEE Development Engineers Limited | INE841L01016)**: Added to ST-ASM Stage I. Similar impact — elevated margin requirements may deter speculative activity and reduce trading volumes.

**REXPIPES (Rex Pipes And Cables Industries Limited | INE00D001018)**: Added to ST-ASM Stage I. Enhanced margins effective from February 26, 2026.

**OMFURN (Omfurn India Limited | INE338Y01016)**: Moved from ST-ASM Stage II to Stage I — a partial relaxation. Margin requirement reduces from 100% to 50% minimum, potentially improving liquidity and reducing trading costs for market participants.

Overall market impact is moderate-to-high for participants holding positions in these specific securities. The circular reinforces NSE's ongoing surveillance activity and does not reflect any fundamental adverse findings about the listed companies.
