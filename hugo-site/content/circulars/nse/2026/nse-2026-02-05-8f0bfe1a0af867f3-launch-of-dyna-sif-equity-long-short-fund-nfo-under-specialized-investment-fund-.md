## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to a new mutual fund offering in the Specialized Investment Fund category. The launch is relevant to:

- NSE MF Invest Platform members who will facilitate investor transactions
- Investors interested in equity long-short strategies under the SIF framework
- The mutual fund distribution ecosystem

The equity long-short strategy is typically associated with hedge fund-like approaches within the mutual fund structure, targeting sophisticated investors. The impact is limited to mutual fund market participants and does not affect broader equity or debt market operations.
