These schemes will not be available for transactions on the specified dates.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors should note that the listed mutual fund schemes will not be available for purchase, redemption, or switch transactions on the specified non-business days

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal - affects only specific mutual fund schemes on designated dates

**Operational Impact**: Limited to investors and distributors dealing with the specified international and fund-of-fund schemes. Domestic equity and debt funds remain unaffected.

**Investor Impact**: Investors planning transactions in these schemes need to schedule purchases or redemptions on alternative dates. The non-business days likely correspond to holidays in the underlying markets (China, US, ASEAN markets).

**Scheme Categories Affected**:
- International equity funds (Greater China, ASEAN, Emerging Markets, US-specific)
- Global thematic funds (World Gold Mining, Global Innovation)
- Fund of Funds investing in overseas securities

Investors with systematic investment plans (SIPs) or systematic withdrawal plans (SWPs) should verify if their transactions will be processed on the next available business day.
