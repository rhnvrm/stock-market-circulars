## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a standard SME IPO listing on the EMERGE platform with limited market capitalization and restricted to SME segment participants.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members can access the new security from January 22, 2026. The Trade for Trade Surveillance Segment classification indicates enhanced monitoring, requiring settlement on a trade-for-trade basis rather than netted settlement.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors interested in SME segment can participate. The 2,000 share market lot represents an investment of approximately Rs. 114,000 at IPO price. Significant portion of shares (12,220,000 out of 16,870,000) are under lock-in periods ranging from 1 to 3 years, limiting immediate liquidity.

**Liquidity Considerations**: Market maker arrangement with NNM Securities Private Limited ensures baseline liquidity with maximum 10% spread. Initial listing in surveillance segment may limit trading activity compared to normal rolling settlement.
