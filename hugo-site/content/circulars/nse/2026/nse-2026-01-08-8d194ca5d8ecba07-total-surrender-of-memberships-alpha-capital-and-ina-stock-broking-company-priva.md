## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. These are routine membership surrenders of two trading members who had already ceased trading operations. Alpha Capital stopped trading in May 2025, while INA Stock Broking Company Private Limited ceased operations as far back as November 2018. The surrenders formalize their exit from the exchange and have no effect on market operations or other participants.
