title: Early Pay-in of Securities for ETFs of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company
  Limited

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited (NCL) has issued guidance to all Members, Custodians, and PCMs regarding the early pay-in (EPI) process for five Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company ETFs undergoing a face value split (sub-division) from Rs 10/- per share to Re 1/- per share, with a record date and ex-date of February 27, 2026. Members must use the old/existing ISIN for early pay-in on the ex-date and switch to the new ISIN after the record date.

## Key Points

- Five Kotak Mahindra ETFs are undergoing a face value split from Rs 10/- to Re 1/- per share, effective February 27, 2026.
- Early pay-in on February 27, 2026 must be made using the **old/existing ISIN** without adjusting for the conversion.
- For a sale of 10 shares (post-split quantity), the early pay-in in the depository should be in the old ISIN for a quantity of **1 share**.
- From March 2, 2026 onwards, pay-in/early pay-in instructions must use the **new ISIN**.
- Custodians providing EPI through pool accounts must upload client-wise EPI allocation details based on actual traded quantity (e.g., 10 shares).
- In case of EPI through block mechanism, the client-wise EPI allocation file should **not** be uploaded.
- Members are reminded to adhere to NCL circular NCL/CMPT/53386 dated August 22, 2022 on Block Mechanism in demat accounts.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes are introduced. This circular operationalizes existing provisions under Item 10.18 'Early Pay-in of Securities for Margin Exemption' of consolidated circular NCL/CMPT/67751 dated April 29, 2025, specifically for the face value split corporate action of the listed Kotak Mahindra ETFs.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Members/Custodians/PCMs** must use the old/existing ISIN for early pay-in instructions submitted on February 27, 2026 (Settlement No. 2026041).
- On and after March 2, 2026, early pay-in must be executed using the **new ISIN** (Settlement Nos. 2026041 & 2026042).
- Custodians using pool accounts for EPI must upload client-wise allocation files reflecting actual traded quantities.
- Members using block mechanism for EPI must **not** upload client-wise allocation files.
- All participants must ensure ISIN conversion ratios are correctly applied when submitting depository instructions around the record date.

## Important Dates

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| February 26, 2026 | Circular issued |
| February 27, 2026 | Ex-date and Record Date for face value split; EPI must use old ISIN (Settlement No. 2026041) |
| March 2, 2026 | EPI must use new ISIN (Settlement Nos. 2026041 & 2026042) |

## Impact Assessment

**Affected ETFs:**

| Security | Symbol | Old ISIN |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Kotak Nifty Bank ETF | BANKNIFTY1 | INF174K01F59 |
| Kotak Nifty India Consumption ETF | CONS | INF174KA1JE5 |
| Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund - Kotak Silver ETF | SILVER1 | INF174KA1KU9 |
| Kotak Nifty 50 Value 20 ETF | NV20 | INF174K01Z71 |
| Kotak Nifty Midcap 50 ETF | MIDCAP | INF174KA1IB3 |

This circular has a **medium operational impact** on members and custodians actively trading or holding these five ETFs around the split record date. Failure to use the correct ISIN during settlement could result in failed pay-in instructions or loss of margin exemption benefits. The adjustment ratio (1 old share = 10 new shares) must be correctly applied. Broader market impact is limited as this is an operational/settlement process clarification for a routine corporate action.
