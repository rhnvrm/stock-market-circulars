## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing of partly paid-up equity shares representing an additional issuance by Solara Active Pharma Sciences Limited. The relatively small number of shares (19,740) suggests limited immediate market impact. The shares will trade under a separate symbol (SOLARAPP1) to distinguish them from fully paid-up shares, allowing investors to identify and trade these securities appropriately.
