## Key Points

- Mobilise App Lab Limited is newly listed on NSE under the SME IPO category.
- Shareholding pattern filed under Regulation 31(1)(a) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations.
- The company has shares in locked-in status, which is typical for SME IPO promoter holdings post-listing.

- Promoter holdings carry no pledge, Non-Disposal Undertaking (NDU), or any other encumbrance.
- No equity shares with differential voting rights exist.
- No significant beneficial owner has been declared.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes are introduced. The circular is a standard listing and shareholding pattern disclosure pursuant to SEBI LODR Regulations, specifically Reg. 31(1)(a), which requires listed entities to submit a shareholding pattern at the time of listing.

## Compliance Requirements

- Mobilise App Lab Limited is required to maintain and update its shareholding pattern disclosures with NSE as per SEBI LODR norms.
- The locked-in shares must remain locked for the statutory period as prescribed under SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations.
- Any future changes in shareholding, encumbrance, or lock-in status must be reported promptly to the exchange.

- **Shareholding Pattern Report Date:** February 27, 2026 (filed under Reg. 31(1)(a))

## Impact Assessment

The listing of Mobilise App Lab Limited on NSE's SME platform expands the SME segment offerings. The shareholding pattern indicates a clean capital structure with no outstanding convertible instruments, warrants, or promoter encumbrances, which is a positive indicator for investor confidence. The presence of locked-in shares is standard for SME IPOs and restricts near-term supply of promoter-held shares in the secondary market. Overall market impact is limited to participants in the SME segment.
