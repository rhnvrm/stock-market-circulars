title: Change in the links to access UCI Online via Member Portal and APIs
---

## Summary

NSE has announced changes to the links for accessing UCI (Unique Client Code) Online via Member Portal and APIs. The existing UAT environment link https://uat.connect2nsccl.com/MemberPortalRevamp/ will be replaced with https://lama.uat.nseindia.com/MemberPortalRevamp/. The old links will be discontinued effective April 01, 2026. Additionally, files downloaded/placed by the Extranet by UCI Team will be available at https://ims.connect2nsccl.com/MemberPortal/.

## Key Points

- New UAT Member Portal link: https://lama.uat.nseindia.com/MemberPortalRevamp/
- Old UAT Member Portal link: https://uat.connect2nsccl.com/MemberPortalRevamp/ (being discontinued)
- UCI Team Extranet files location: https://ims.connect2nsccl.com/MemberPortal/
- This circular references previous circular NSE/ISC/70019 dated September 04, 2025
- Support available via toll-free number 1800 266 0050 (option 5) and email uci@nse.co.in

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a technical infrastructure update to the UCI Online access system.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must migrate to the new UAT Member Portal link before April 01, 2026
- Members should update their systems and bookmarks to use the new URLs
- Members using APIs should update their API endpoint configurations to the new links
- Members should test their access to UCI Online using the new links in the UAT environment

## Important Dates

- **January 01, 2026**: New links become available for member use
- **April 01, 2026**: Existing old links will be discontinued and no longer accessible

## Impact Assessment

This change has medium operational impact on NSE members who use UCI Online for updating Unique Client Code information. Members need to update their internal systems, scripts, and API integrations before the April 2026 deadline to avoid service disruption. The transition period of three months provides adequate time for members to migrate to the new infrastructure. Failure to migrate could result in inability to access UCI Online services, which are essential for client code management and regulatory compliance.
