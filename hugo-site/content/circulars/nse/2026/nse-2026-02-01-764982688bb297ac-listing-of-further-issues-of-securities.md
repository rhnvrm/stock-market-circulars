## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. This is a routine administrative notification for ESOP-based equity allotments. The number of shares being listed represents a small fraction of the total outstanding shares for each company. ESOP allotments are typically awarded to employees and do not represent new capital raising or significant dilution. Trading will commence with standard market lot size of 1 share, and all securities rank pari passu with existing equity shares. No trading restrictions or lock-in periods apply to these securities.
