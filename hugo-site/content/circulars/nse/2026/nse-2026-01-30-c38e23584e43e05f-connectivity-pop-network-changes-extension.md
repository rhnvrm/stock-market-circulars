## Summary

NSE has extended the migration deadline for self-service leased line connectivity from the existing Jivan Vihar Delhi POP to the new Sify Okhla POP until February 15, 2026. This extension is granted as a substantial number of self-service links remain pending migration, despite progress made. The existing Delhi POP (Jivan Vihar) will be discontinued after February 15, 2026.

## Key Points

- Migration deadline extended from January 31, 2026 to February 15, 2026
- Extension applies only to self-service links at Delhi POP (Jivan Vihar)
- New POP location: Sify Okhla, Delhi
- Substantial count of self-service links still pending migration
- Members with subscribed links must complete migration before the revised deadline
- Telecom Network Integrator (TNI): Sify Technologies
- Continuation of previous circulars dated August 5, 2025 through January 9, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational infrastructure migration with an extended compliance timeline.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members with self-service leased line connectivity at existing Jivan Vihar Delhi POP must migrate to new Sify Okhla POP
- Migration must be completed by end of day February 15, 2026
- Members should coordinate with Sify Technologies for migration support
- Escalation matrix provided for technical support and issues:
  - NOC Support: 18004199963 / 044-61332900 (nse.servicedesk@sifycorp.com)
  - Onsite Team: For new application requests before commissioning
  - Multiple escalation levels available with defined response times

## Important Dates

- **January 30, 2026**: Circular issuance date
- **January 31, 2026**: Original migration deadline (now extended)
- **February 15, 2026**: Revised migration deadline (end of day)
- **After February 15, 2026**: Existing Jivan Vihar Delhi POP to be discontinued by TNI
- **August 5, 2025**: Initial migration announcement

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Members with self-service connectivity at the Delhi Jivan Vihar POP have additional 15 days to complete migration. Failure to migrate by February 15, 2026 will result in loss of connectivity as the old POP will be discontinued.

**Market Impact**: Low direct market impact. This is an infrastructure change affecting member connectivity infrastructure only.

**Member Action Required**: Members must proactively coordinate with Sify to complete migration of remaining self-service links. Managed service links migration status should be confirmed with Sify NOC team.

**Support Available**: Comprehensive escalation matrix provided with 5 levels of support for managed services and 4 levels for new application requests, including 24/7 NOC support via toll-free number and email.
