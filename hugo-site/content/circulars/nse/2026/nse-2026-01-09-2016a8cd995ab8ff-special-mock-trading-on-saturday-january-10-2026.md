title: Special Mock Trading on Saturday, January 10, 2026
---

## Summary

NSE will conduct special mock trading sessions in the Futures & Options Segment on Saturday, January 10, 2026. The mock will include three trading sessions from Primary and DR sites. Importantly, NSE and BSE will test the business continuity mechanism mandated by SEBI, where NSE will induce an outage and BSE will serve as the alternative trading venue for NSE exclusive contracts. Members must actively participate in all sessions.

## Key Points

- Mock trading scheduled for January 10, 2026 with three distinct trading sessions
- Trading Session-1 (Primary Site): 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM
- Trading Session-2 (BCP/DR Site): 13:15 PM - 13:45 PM
- Trading Session-3 (Primary Site): 15:30 PM - 16:45 PM
- Live Re-login testing: 20:00 - 20:30
- Orders and trades from sessions 1 & 2 will not be available in session 3
- NEAT+ version 7.8.7 will be used for mock trading
- Business continuity testing: NSE will induce outage at 12:30 PM and invoke BSE as alternative trading venue
- NSE operations will resume from DR site at 13:15 PM

## Regulatory Changes

This mock implements SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD/P/CIR/2024/167 dated November 28, 2024, which directed NSE and BSE to establish a business continuity mechanism ensuring an alternative trading venue for interoperable segments. NSE provisioned this through circular NSE/MSD/67344 dated March 28, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- All F&O members must actively participate in all three mock trading sessions
- Members should familiarize themselves with NEAT+ version 7.8.7 available at /faoftp/faocommon/NEATPlus787
- Members must be prepared to transition to BSE as alternative trading venue during the induced outage scenario
- Members should monitor broadcast messages on trading terminals for real-time instructions during the mock
- Members must refer to NSE circular NSE/MSD/67344 dated March 28, 2025 for detailed procedures on business continuity for interoperable segments

## Important Dates

- **January 10, 2026**: Mock trading day
  - 11:00 AM: Session-1 Pre-open starts (Primary Site)
  - 12:30 PM: NSE induces stoppage and invokes BSE as alternative venue
  - 13:15 PM: Session-2 Pre-open starts (DR Site)
  - 15:30 PM: Session-3 Pre-open starts (Primary Site)
  - 20:00-20:30: Live Re-login testing window

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Members must dedicate resources for Saturday mock participation across multiple sessions. The business continuity testing requires members to be prepared for seamless transition to BSE as alternative venue.

**Market Impact**: None - This is a mock trading exercise with no impact on live markets.

**Preparedness Required**: Members need to ensure their systems and personnel are ready to handle:
1. Multiple mock sessions with data reset between sessions
2. Transition to BSE alternative venue during induced outage
3. Resume trading on NSE DR site post-recovery
4. Monitor and respond to broadcast messages throughout the mock

**Strategic Importance**: This mock tests critical business continuity infrastructure mandated by SEBI, ensuring market resilience in case of actual exchange outages.
