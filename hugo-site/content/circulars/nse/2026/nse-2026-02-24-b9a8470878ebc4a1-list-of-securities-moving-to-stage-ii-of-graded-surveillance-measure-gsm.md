## Summary

NSE has issued Circular No. 145/2026 (Ref: NSE/SURV/72963) dated February 24, 2026, notifying members that Gujarat Lease Financing Limited (Symbol: GLFL, ISIN: INE540A01017) will be moved to Stage II of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective February 25, 2026. The stock will also undergo a series change from EQ to BE. This action continues a series of GSM-related circulars dating back to February 2017.

## Key Points

- **Security affected:** Gujarat Lease Financing Limited (GLFL), ISIN: INE540A01017
- **GSM Stage:** Moving to Stage II effective February 25, 2026
- **Series change:** EQ to BE (also being added as per BSE)
- **Settlement mode:** Trade-for-Trade (no netting off allowed)
- **Price band:** 5% or lower as applicable
- **Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD):** 50% of trade value to be deposited by buyers
- **Authority:** Binoy Yohannan, Vice President, Surveillance, NSE
- **Circular reference chain:** NSE/SURV/34262, 38389, 42790, 59425, 64066, 71670

## Regulatory Changes

GLFL is being escalated to Stage II of the GSM framework, which imposes stricter trading conditions compared to Stage I. Under Stage II, all trades are settled on a trade-to-trade basis with no netting permitted, and buyers must deposit an Additional Surveillance Deposit of 50% of the trade value. The stock series is simultaneously changed from EQ to BE, reflecting the enhanced surveillance status.

## Compliance Requirements

- **NSE Members** must note the Stage II GSM placement for GLFL effective February 25, 2026
- **Buyers** of GLFL must deposit ASD of 50% of trade value at the time of trading
- **All trades** must be settled on a trade-to-trade basis; no netting off is permitted
- Members should take adequate precautions while trading in GLFL given the surveillance restrictions
- Members with queries may contact NSE Surveillance at surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 24, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 25, 2026 (Stage II GSM restrictions take effect)

## Impact Assessment

The move to Stage II GSM significantly restricts trading in GLFL. The trade-for-trade settlement eliminates the possibility of intraday netting, increasing capital requirements for traders. The mandatory 50% ASD for buyers substantially raises the cost of acquiring the stock, likely reducing liquidity. The 5% price band further limits daily price movement. Combined with the series change from EQ to BE, these measures signal heightened regulatory concern about the stock's trading patterns and are intended to protect investors from potential price manipulation or abnormal volatility. Traders and investors holding or considering positions in GLFL should reassess their strategies in light of these restrictions.
