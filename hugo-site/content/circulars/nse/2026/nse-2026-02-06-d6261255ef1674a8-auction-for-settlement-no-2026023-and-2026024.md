---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued a partial modification to the settlement calendar, revising the auction schedule for settlement numbers 2026023 and 2026024. This circular modifies previous circulars NCL/CMPT/72228 (dated January 09, 2026) and NCL/CMPT/72621 (dated February 04, 2026). Key changes include: no auction settlement will be conducted for A-2026023, and shortages from M-2026023 and M-2026024 will be reassigned to later auction settlements.

## Key Points

- No Auction Settlement shall be conducted in A-2026023
- Shortages (CC and internal shortages) of M-2026023 will be assigned to Auction A-2026024
- Shortages (CC and internal shortages) of M-2026024 will be assigned to Auction A-2026025
- Settlement M-2026023: Trade Date 03-Feb-26, Settlement Date 04-Feb-26
- Settlement M-2026024: Trade Date 04-Feb-26, Settlement Date 05-Feb-26
- Auction A-2026024: Trade Date 05-Feb-26, Settlement Date 06-Feb-26, Pay-in Time 08:00 AM
- Auction A-2026025: Trade Date 06-Feb-26, Settlement Date 09-Feb-26, Pay-in Time 08:00 AM

## Regulatory Changes

This circular modifies the previously published settlement calendar for February 2026 Capital Market Segment (T+1 & T+0 Settlement). The key regulatory change is the elimination of Auction Settlement A-2026023, with its shortages being redistributed to subsequent auction settlements.

## Compliance Requirements

- All Members, Custodians, and PCMs must note the revised auction schedule
- Participants must adhere to the revised pay-in timings of 08:00 AM for auctions A-2026024 and A-2026025
- Members should take note of auction cut-off timings for pay-in at depositories due to revised settlement times on February 06, 2026 and February 09, 2026
- Shortages must be settled according to the new assignment schedule

## Important Dates

- **February 03, 2026**: Trade Date for M-2026023
- **February 04, 2026**: Settlement Date for M-2026023; Trade Date for M-2026024
- **February 05, 2026**: Settlement Date for M-2026024; Auction Trade Date for A-2026024
- **February 06, 2026**: Auction Settlement Date for A-2026024 (Pay-in: 08:00 AM); revised depository cut-off timing applies
- **February 06, 2026**: Auction Trade Date for A-2026025
- **February 09, 2026**: Auction Settlement Date for A-2026025 (Pay-in: 08:00 AM); revised depository cut-off timing applies

## Impact Assessment

This circular has operational impact on members with delivery shortages in the Capital Market Segment. The elimination of Auction A-2026023 and reassignment of shortages to later auction settlements affects the timeline for resolving delivery obligations. Members must ensure they are prepared for the revised pay-in times at 08:00 AM for both affected auctions. The changes to depository cut-off timings on February 06 and 09, 2026 require coordination between clearing members and depositories to ensure timely completion of auction settlements.
