## Impact Assessment

This circular is of moderate impact, limited to existing shareholders of Sadhana Nitrochem Limited and trading members handling RE transactions. The Rights Entitlements are admitted in the Trade to Trade segment (BE series), meaning each transaction results in compulsory delivery — no intraday netting is permitted. With a large volume of 2.63 billion REs, liquidity and pricing of the REs could be of interest to arbitrageurs and rights issue participants. Shareholders who do not subscribe or renounce by March 5, 2026 will have their REs lapse after the Issue Closing Date.
