## Summary

The National Stock Exchange has announced a change in the ISIN code for Quantum Nifty 50 ETF (symbol: QNIFTY) managed by Quantum Asset Management Company Private Limited. The new ISIN INF082J01499 will be effective from February 13, 2026, following a sub-division of units from Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/-.

## Key Points

- ETF Symbol: QNIFTY
- Fund Name: Quantum Nifty 50 ETF
- New ISIN: INF082J01499
- Reason: Sub-division of units from Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/-
- The new ISIN shall be effective for all trades done on and from February 13, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

This is an administrative change related to the sub-division of ETF units, which requires a new ISIN code to be assigned. The face value reduction from Rs. 10 to Re. 1 necessitates this ISIN update to maintain proper identification and tracking of the security.

## Compliance Requirements

- All exchange members must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN code
- Trading systems must be configured to use the new ISIN for all trades executed on or after the ex-date
- Back-office and settlement systems need to be updated accordingly
- Investors and market participants should take note of the ISIN change for their records and portfolio tracking

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 10, 2026
- **Ex-Date (Effective Date):** February 13, 2026 - New ISIN becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

The change is primarily administrative in nature. The sub-division of units from Rs. 10 to Re. 1 makes the ETF more accessible to retail investors by reducing the minimum investment amount. Market participants need to ensure their systems are updated to reflect the new ISIN code to avoid any settlement or tracking issues. The impact is medium as it requires system updates across brokerages, depositories, and investor portfolios, but does not alter the underlying investment strategy or holdings of the ETF.
