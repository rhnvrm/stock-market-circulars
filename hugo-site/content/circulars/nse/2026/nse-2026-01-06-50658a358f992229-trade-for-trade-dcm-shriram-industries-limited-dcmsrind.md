This change follows previous circulars dated December 16, 2025 and December 18, 2025, and is implemented pursuant to SEBI guidelines (CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012).

- Change effective from January 09, 2026 (Friday)
- Action follows SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012
- This is a continuation of earlier circulars NSE/CML/71842 (December 16, 2025) and NSE/CML/71886 (December 18, 2025)

- Trading members must ensure clients are informed about the change in trading mode
- All pending orders in BE series should be managed before the transition date

## Impact Assessment

This change is positive for DCMSRIND as it removes trading restrictions and allows the stock to trade in the normal rolling settlement segment.

Investors will have more flexibility in trading the stock, and the move suggests improved compliance or resolution of previous concerns that led to trade-for-trade classification.
