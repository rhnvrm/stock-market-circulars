## Summary

NSE has announced the removal of 8 exclusively listed companies from the Dissemination Board (DB) effective February 04, 2026. These companies were originally listed on de-recognized, non-operational, or exited stock exchanges. The removals are based on various grounds including negative/NIL valuation, exit options to shareholders, MCA strike-off, dissolution through liquidation, and listing on other exchanges with nationwide trading terminals.

## Key Points

- Removals are pursuant to SEBI circulars dated October 10, 2016, August 01, 2017, and October 16, 2023
- Companies affected were exclusively listed on de-recognized/non-operational/exited stock exchanges
- Removal effective date: February 04, 2026
- Various grounds for removal including negative valuation, exit options, MCA strike-off, and liquidation

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements provisions from:
- SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/DSA/CIR/P/2016/110 dated October 10, 2016
- SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/DSA/CIR/P/2017/92 dated August 01, 2017
- Chapter 6 of Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD2/PoD-2/CIR/P/2023/171 dated October 16, 2023

## Compliance Requirements

- Members are required to note that the listed companies will no longer be available on NSE's Dissemination Board
- No specific action required from members beyond awareness of the removal

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: February 03, 2026
- **Effective Date of Removal**: February 04, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this circular is minimal as it involves exclusively listed companies from de-recognized, non-operational, or exited stock exchanges. These companies were already on the Dissemination Board with limited or no trading activity. The removal is primarily an administrative cleanup action and does not affect actively traded securities on NSE. Market participants will have no access to these securities on NSE's Dissemination Board after the effective date.
