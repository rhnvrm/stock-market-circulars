title: Temporary Suspension of Fresh Subscriptions in Motilal Oswal Nifty Microcap
  250 Index Fund
---

## Summary

NSE has disabled fresh subscriptions in Motilal Oswal Nifty Microcap 250 Index Fund on the NSE MF Invest Platform with immediate effect from January 8, 2026 cut-off time. This action follows communication from Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund and consultation with SEBI, as microcap is not defined as a category based on market capitalization. The suspension includes lumpsum subscriptions, fresh SIP/STP registrations, and switch-in transactions, while existing SIPs/STPs will be paused.

## Key Points

- Fresh and additional lumpsum purchases discontinued with immediate effect
- Fresh registrations under SIP and STP discontinued
- Switch-in transactions from other Motilal Oswal MF schemes discontinued
- Existing SIPs/STPs paused from effective date (January 8, 2026)
- No restrictions on redemptions, SWPs, switch-out, and STP-out transactions
- Subscription amounts received after January 8, 2026 cut-off time will be refunded without interest
- Switch-in transactions received until January 8, 2026 cut-off time will be processed
- Action taken in consultation with SEBI due to undefined microcap category

## Regulatory Changes

This discontinuation is issued in consultation with SEBI as microcap is not defined as a category based on market capitalization under current regulations. The suspension represents a regulatory alignment measure to address the absence of a formal microcap definition in SEBI's mutual fund categorization framework.

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact (High):**
- Investors cannot make fresh investments in this microcap index fund
- Existing SIP investors will have their systematic investments paused
- No impact on exit options - investors can redeem or switch out freely

**Market Impact (High):**
- Reflects regulatory uncertainty around microcap mutual fund category definition
- May impact investor access to microcap segment through mutual fund route
- Sets precedent for other microcap-focused schemes pending regulatory clarity

**Operational Impact (Medium):**
