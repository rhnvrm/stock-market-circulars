## Summary

NSE has issued a corrigendum to its earlier circular (NSE/CML/72044 dated December 29, 2025) regarding suspension of trading in Treasury Bills. Three T-Bills with maturity date of January 15, 2026 will be suspended from trading effective January 12, 2026 due to redemption on maturity.

## Key Points

- Corrigendum to earlier circular NSE/CML/72044 dated December 29, 2025
- Three Treasury Bills suspended from trading due to maturity
- Suspension effective from January 12, 2026
- Based on Clearing Corporation Circular No. NCL/CMPT/72224 dated January 09, 2026
- All three securities are TB (Treasury Bill) series

## Securities Affected

| Symbol | Series | ISIN | Suspension Date | Reason |
|--------|--------|------|-----------------|--------|
| 91D150126 | TB | IN002025X299 | January 12, 2026 | Maturity |
| 182D150126 | TB | IN002025Y164 | January 12, 2026 | Maturity |
| 364D150126 | TB | IN002024Z404 | January 12, 2026 | Maturity |

## Compliance Requirements

- All members must note the suspension of trading in the specified Treasury Bills
- No trading permitted in these securities from January 12, 2026 onwards
- Members should update their trading systems accordingly

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** January 09, 2026
- **Trading Suspension Date:** January 12, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative circular with minimal market impact. The suspension affects only three specific Treasury Bills reaching maturity. Investors holding these securities will receive redemption proceeds on the maturity date. This is standard practice for maturing debt instruments and does not affect broader market operations or other securities.
