title: Change in Name of HDFC AMC ETF Schemes - Gold, SENSEX, and BSE 500 ETFs
---

## Summary

NSE has informed all members that HDFC Asset Management Company Limited is renaming three of its Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) schemes with effect from February 27, 2026. The changes involve dropping the 'HDFC Mutual Fund' prefix and simplifying scheme names. ISINs and trading symbols remain unchanged.

## Key Points

- Three HDFC AMC ETF schemes will have their names changed effective February 27, 2026
- ISINs and NSE symbols are unaffected by the renaming
- HDFC Gold Exchange Traded Fund (INF179KC1981, symbol: HDFCGOLD) renamed to **HDFC Gold ETF**
- HDFC S&P BSE SENSEX ETF (INF179KC1HX2, symbol: HDFCSENSEX) renamed to **HDFC BSE SENSEX ETF**
- HDFC Mutual Fund - HDFC S&P BSE 500 ETF (INF179KC1EZ4, symbol: HDFCBSE500) renamed to **HDFC BSE 500 ETF**

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are involved. This is a scheme name update notified by NSE to all exchange members under the Listing department circular NSE/CML/72944 (Circular Ref. No. 0299/2026).

## Compliance Requirements

Members and market participants should update their internal systems, client-facing documentation, and records to reflect the new ETF scheme names from February 27, 2026 onwards. No other compliance action is required as ISINs and trading symbols remain the same.

## Important Dates

- **February 23, 2026**: Circular issued by NSE
- **February 27, 2026**: New scheme names become effective

## Impact Assessment

Market impact is minimal. The renaming is a branding exercise by HDFC AMC to simplify ETF scheme names by removing the 'HDFC Mutual Fund' prefix. Since ISINs (INF179KC1981, INF179KC1HX2, INF179KC1EZ4) and trading symbols (HDFCGOLD, HDFCSENSEX, HDFCBSE500) are unchanged, there is no disruption to trading, settlement, or investor holdings. Investors holding these ETFs need not take any action.
