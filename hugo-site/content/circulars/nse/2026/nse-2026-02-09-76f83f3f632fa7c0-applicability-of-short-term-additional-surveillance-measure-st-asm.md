title: Applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

NSE has announced the inclusion of securities under the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective February 11, 2026. Five securities are being placed in ST-ASM Stage I with 50% minimum margin requirements, one security is moving from Stage I to Stage II (100% margin), and one security is moving from Stage II to Stage I. The measure is a surveillance action and not an adverse action against the companies.

## Key Points

- 5 securities included in ST-ASM Stage I: AVPINFRA, CONSOFINVT, IZMO, PRESSTONIC, and VIVIANA
- No new securities in ST-ASM Stage II
- COOLCAPS moving from Stage I to Stage II (higher margin requirement)
- VIVIMEDLAB moving from Stage II to Stage I (reduced margin requirement)
- ST-ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Action is purely for market surveillance purposes, not an adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

**ST-ASM Stage I Securities:**
- Applicable margin: 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at 100%
- Applies to all open positions as on February 10, 2026 and new positions from February 11, 2026

**ST-ASM Stage II Securities:**
- Applicable margin: 100% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at 100%
- Applies to all open positions as on February 10, 2026 and new positions from February 11, 2026

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with enhanced margin requirements for affected securities
- Members should note that ASM framework works alongside other surveillance measures
- Participants can refer to FAQs at https://www.nseindia.com/regulations/additional-surveillance-measure
- Queries should be directed to surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 09, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 11, 2026
- Enhanced margins apply to open positions as on February 10, 2026 and new positions from February 11, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Trading:**
The enhanced margin requirements significantly impact liquidity and trading in affected securities. Stage I securities require minimum 50% margin, while Stage II requires 100% margin, substantially increasing capital requirements for traders. COOLCAPS traders face doubled margin requirements moving to Stage II. VIVIMEDLAB traders benefit from reduced requirements moving to Stage I. This surveillance action indicates heightened volatility or price movement concerns in these securities, potentially deterring speculative trading and encouraging more cautious market participation.
