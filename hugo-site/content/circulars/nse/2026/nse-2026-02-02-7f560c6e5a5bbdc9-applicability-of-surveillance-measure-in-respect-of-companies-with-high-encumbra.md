## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure minimum 35% margin is collected on all positions in the 8 newly added securities
- Margin requirement applies to both:
  - All open positions existing as on February 4, 2026
  - All new positions created from February 5, 2026 onwards
- Margin applies across both Equity and Equity Derivatives segments
- This surveillance measure operates in conjunction with all other existing surveillance measures
- Members must monitor and comply with margin requirements for the consolidated list of 13 securities

## Important Dates

- **February 2, 2026**: Circular issued
- **February 3, 2026**: 6 securities removed from surveillance framework
- **February 4, 2026**: Last day before margin requirements apply to new additions
- **February 5, 2026**: 35% margin requirement becomes effective for 8 newly added securities (applies to existing open positions and all new positions)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Significant margin increase (35%) will increase capital requirements for traders holding positions in the 8 newly added securities
- Notable inclusion of large-cap stock VEDL (Vedanta Limited) indicates high promoter encumbrance across market capitalizations
- Infrastructure and power sector heavily represented (AFCONS, GMR Power, Patel Engineering, RattanIndia Power)

**Trading Impact:**
- Higher margin requirements will reduce leverage available to traders
- May lead to position unwinding or reduced trading volumes in affected securities
- Increased cost of carry for both equity and derivatives positions
- Traders with existing open positions must arrange additional margin by February 4, 2026

**Risk Management:**
- Measure addresses systemic risk from high promoter share pledging/encumbrance
- Aligns with SEBI (SAST) Regulation 28(3) disclosure requirements
- Provides additional buffer against potential promoter share invocation scenarios
- Six securities graduating out indicates improved encumbrance levels for those companies
