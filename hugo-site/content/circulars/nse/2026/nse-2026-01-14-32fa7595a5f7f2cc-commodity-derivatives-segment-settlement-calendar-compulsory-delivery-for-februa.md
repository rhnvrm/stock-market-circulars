## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - affects members with delivery obligations in commodity futures contracts. Requires timely submission of delivery intentions and arrangement of physical commodities/funds.

**Market Impact:** Low - routine monthly settlement schedule with no changes to existing delivery mechanisms or timelines.

**Trader Impact:** Medium for those holding positions into expiry - must plan for physical delivery or square off positions before expiry. Gold contracts with additional delivery centres have extended delivery windows (Jan 27-Feb 4) compared to primary delivery centre contracts.

**Compliance Impact:** Low - standard operational compliance required for delivery settlement process. Members familiar with existing T+1 IMS settlement procedures.
