The ~10x increase in all SLB position limits for ANGELONE significantly expands the capacity for securities lending and borrowing activity in this scrip. This may enhance liquidity in the SLB market for ANGELONE and allow participants and institutional clients to take larger positions. The change is administrative in nature and is a partial modification of a prior monthly revision circular. Direct impact is limited to SLB participants and clients active in ANGELONE; broader equity market trading is unaffected.
