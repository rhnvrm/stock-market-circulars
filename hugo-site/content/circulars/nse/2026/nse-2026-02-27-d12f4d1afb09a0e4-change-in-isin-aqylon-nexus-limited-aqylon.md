title: Change in ISIN for Aqylon Nexus Limited (AQYLON) Due to Share Sub-Division
---

## Summary

NSE has notified all exchange members that the ISIN code for the equity shares of Aqylon Nexus Limited (symbol: AQYLON) will be changed effective March 05, 2026. The change is a result of a sub-division of the company's equity shares from a face value of Rs. 10/- per share to Re. 1/- per share.

## Key Points

- The ISIN for Aqylon Nexus Limited (AQYLON) will change to **INE416A01051**.
- The change is consequent to a share sub-division (stock split) from Rs. 10/- face value to Re. 1/- face value.
- The new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date, i.e., **March 05, 2026**.
- All exchange members are required to take note of the new ISIN for settlement and trading purposes.

## Regulatory Changes

The ISIN reassignment is in accordance with standard NSE procedures governing corporate actions. Upon sub-division of equity shares, the existing ISIN is retired and a new ISIN is assigned to reflect the changed face value of the security.

## Compliance Requirements

- All members must update their trading and back-office systems to reflect the new ISIN (INE416A01051) for Aqylon Nexus Limited prior to March 05, 2026.
- Settlement of trades from the ex-date onwards must reference the new ISIN only.
- Members should communicate the ISIN change to their clients holding or transacting in AQYLON shares.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 27, 2026
- **Ex-Date / Effective Date:** March 05, 2026 — New ISIN (INE416A01051) becomes operative for all trades.

## Impact Assessment

This change is operationally significant for members and custodians holding or trading Aqylon Nexus Limited shares. Failure to update systems with the new ISIN prior to the ex-date could result in settlement failures or mismatches. The sub-division increases the number of shares in circulation while proportionally reducing the face value, which may improve liquidity for retail investors. The impact is confined to participants directly dealing in AQYLON securities.
