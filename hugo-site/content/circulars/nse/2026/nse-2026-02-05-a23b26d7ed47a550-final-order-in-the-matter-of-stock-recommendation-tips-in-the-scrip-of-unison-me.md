## Summary

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Limited direct market impact as the debarment applies to specific individuals rather than institutional participants. However, it serves as a strong deterrent against fraudulent stock recommendation services.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and trading members must update their systems to prevent these entities from trading. The order reinforces the need for robust KYC and client verification processes.

**Regulatory Significance:** Demonstrates SEBI's commitment to protecting retail investors from fraudulent tip providers and maintaining market integrity. The varying debarment periods (1-3 years) indicate proportionate penalties based on the degree of involvement.
