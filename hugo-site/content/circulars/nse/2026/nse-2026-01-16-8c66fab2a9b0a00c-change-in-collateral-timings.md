title: Change in Collateral Timings - Currency Derivatives Segment
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has revised the timings for collateral addition and release in the Currency Derivatives Segment based on feedback from members. The new timings extend the cut-off time for cash and FDR deposits to 7:30 PM and provide multiple batch timings throughout the day for pledged securities release, ranging from 9:00 AM to 8:00 PM.

## Key Points

- Cut-off time for cash and Fixed Deposit Receipt (FDR) collateral deposit extended to 7:30 PM on all settlement days
- Release of cash/FDR/bank guarantee collateral allowed until 8:00 PM for both immediate and EOD/value date requests
- Pledged securities release available in 10 batches throughout the day with cut-off times from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM for immediate requests
- Pledged securities can also be released with immediate/EOD requests until 8:00 PM
- Special requirement for repledge securities: requests must be made one day prior to pay-in, not on the pay-in date itself

## Regulatory Changes

This circular supersedes the timing provisions in circular ref. no. 043/2025 (Download Ref No: NCL/CMPT/67752 dated April 29, 2025). The revised timings provide greater flexibility to members by:

- Extending deposit cut-off times from earlier schedules
- Introducing multiple batch processing windows for pledged securities
- Allowing members to manage collateral throughout the trading day
