title: Scrips Not Available for T+0 Rolling Settlement Cycle on March 30, 2026
---

## Summary

NSE has notified all members that 20 securities listed on the Capital Market Segment will not be available for trading under the T+0 rolling settlement cycle on March 30, 2026. This restriction applies due to index rebalancing — the affected securities are either moving into or out of an index on which derivatives contracts are available for trading.

## Key Points

- 20 securities are restricted from T+0 rolling settlement trading on March 30, 2026
- The restriction is triggered by index rebalancing affecting indices with active derivative contracts
- This circular references the Capital Market Consolidated Circular NSE/CMTR/67774 dated April 30, 2025 (Chapter 1.6 — trading parameters)
- The restriction is specific to T+0 settlement; normal T+1 and T+2 settlement cycles are not affected
- Issued by Khushal Shah, Associate Vice President, NSE

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes are introduced. This circular enforces an existing provision under Chapter 1.6 of the Capital Market Consolidated Circular (NSE/CMTR/67774, April 30, 2025), which specifies that T+0 securities moving in or out of derivative-linked indices during rebalancing shall be temporarily unavailable for T+0 trading.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must ensure that the 20 listed securities are not offered or processed under the T+0 rolling settlement cycle on March 30, 2026
- Members should update their trading systems and risk controls accordingly ahead of March 30, 2026
- Members may contact NSE via Toll Free No: 1800-266-0050 (Option 1) or email msm@nse.co.in for clarifications

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 24, 2026
- **Restriction Effective Date:** March 30, 2026 (T+0 settlement unavailable for listed securities)

## Impact Assessment

The restriction affects 20 securities spanning banking, insurance, finance, healthcare, IT, energy, and consumer sectors. Traders relying on same-day T+0 settlement for these scrips will need to use standard T+1 settlement on March 30, 2026. The impact is operationally contained and temporary, limited to a single trading day. The underlying cause — index rebalancing — is a routine market event. Affected securities include large-cap names such as HDFCAMC, ICICIGI, ICICIPRULI, LICI, HAVELLS, GODREJPROP, and INDIANB, meaning liquidity in T+0 for these names will be absent on that date.
