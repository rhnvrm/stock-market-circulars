## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected as this is a routine administrative action for listing ESOP allotments. The relatively small number of shares being listed (ranging from 24,132 to 237,656 shares per company) represents marginal dilution to existing equity capital. No trading restrictions or lock-in periods apply, allowing immediate liquidity. This is standard corporate action for employee compensation programs.
