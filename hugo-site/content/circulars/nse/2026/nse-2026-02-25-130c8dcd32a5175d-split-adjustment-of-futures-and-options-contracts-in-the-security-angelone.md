---

## Summary

NSE has announced the adjustment of Futures and Options (F&O) contracts for ANGEL ONE LIMITED (Symbol: ANGELONE) following a 10:1 stock split. The ex-date and effective date for this adjustment is February 26, 2026. The adjustment factor is 10, resulting in revised market lots, strike prices, and quantity freeze limits. Members must update their trading applications with the revised contract files before trading on the ex-date.

## Key Points

- **Company:** ANGEL ONE LIMITED (ANGELONE)
- **Corporate Action:** Stock Split at a ratio of 10:1
- **Face Value:** Rs 10/- (pre-split)
- **Ex-date / Effective Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Adjustment Factor:** 10
- **Revised Market Lot:** 2,500
- **Revised Quantity Freeze Limit:** 1,00,000
- All existing option strike prices are divided by 10 (e.g., Rs 2,850 becomes Rs 285)
- Revised strike scheme will be effective from the trade date after the ex-date
- Members must load updated `contract.gz` / MII contract and spread files before trading on the ex-date

## Regulatory Changes

In pursuance of SEBI guidelines for adjustments to F&O contracts on announcement of corporate actions, all open Futures and Options contracts on ANGELONE will be adjusted as follows:
- Strike prices revised downward by the adjustment factor of 10
- Market lot revised to 2,500
- Quantity freeze limit revised to 1,00,000
- Base prices for futures and adjusted strike prices may appear in decimal places, rounded to the nearest tick size; lot sizes rounded to the nearest integer

## Compliance Requirements

- Members are required to download and load the updated contract file (`NSE_FO_contract_ddmmyyyy.csv.gz`) and spread file (`NSE_FO_spdcontract_ddmmyyyy.csv.gz`) from the `faoftp/faocommon` directory on the Extranet server before trading on the ex-date (February 26, 2026)
- Updated files are also available on the NSE website under All Reports > Derivatives section
- Position adjustment methodology will be separately communicated by the respective Clearing Corporation

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 25, 2026
- **Ex-date / Effective Date for contract adjustments:** February 26, 2026
- **Revised strike scheme effective date:** First trade date after February 26, 2026
- **Affected expiry:** March 30, 2026 (OPTSTK contracts listed in Annexure 1)

## Impact Assessment

This adjustment has a **high operational and market impact** for traders and members holding F&O positions in ANGELONE. All open positions will be adjusted automatically per SEBI guidelines; however, traders must reconcile their positions post-adjustment. The 10:1 split significantly lowers individual strike prices (e.g., from Rs 2,850 to Rs 285), making the stock more accessible at lower notional values per contract. The revised lot size of 2,500 (from the adjustment factor) and increased freeze limit of 1,00,000 reflect the higher number of shares post-split. Failure to update contract files before the ex-date could result in trading errors or system mismatches.
