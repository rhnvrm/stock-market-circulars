## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is an administrative listing of a long-dated government security that expands the range of sovereign debt instruments available on NSE's capital market segment. The 50-year maturity makes this suitable for long-term institutional investors and pension funds.

**Operational Impact:** Low. Members need to update security master data to include the new G-Sec. No changes to trading systems, margin requirements, or operational procedures required beyond standard new security addition protocols.

**Trading Impact:** Limited immediate trading activity expected as government securities typically have specialized investor base and lower retail participation compared to equity markets.
