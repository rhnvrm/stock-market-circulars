## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a routine administrative notification for debt market listings. The commercial papers provide short to medium-term debt instruments for institutional investors.

**Issuer Profile:** Mix of financial services companies (housing finance, securities, capital) and one manufacturing company (CEAT), indicating diverse corporate fundraising activity through commercial paper route.

**Liquidity:** Commercial papers are typically held till maturity by institutional investors, so secondary market trading impact is expected to be limited.
