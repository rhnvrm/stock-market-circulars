## Summary

NSE has issued an extension circular regarding POP (Point of Presence) network changes for member connectivity. The circular includes the updated Sify handbook with escalation matrices for members who use Sify-managed or self-service leased line connectivity to NSE infrastructure.

## Key Points

- Extension granted for POP network changes affecting member connectivity
- Members using Sify Managed Service leased lines should use the NOC escalation matrix for post-commissioning issues
- Members using Sify Self-Service leased lines may use the escalation matrix only for new line configuration and link health at POP level
- Onsite Team escalation matrix provided for new application requests before commissioning
- Members can also refer to the Aakash Portal for additional information provided by Sify

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory rule changes. This is an operational/infrastructure notice providing an extension to previously announced POP network changes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members experiencing connectivity issues with Sify managed leased lines should follow the NOC escalation matrix
- For new application or link commissioning requests, members should contact the Onsite Team as per the provided escalation matrix
- Immediate escalation contact: NSE Service Desk at 18004199963 / 044-61332900 or nse.servicedesk@sifycorp.com

## Important Dates

- Circular date: 2026-02-27
- Extension effective: as specified in the accompanying circular notice (specific revised date not extracted from available content)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal broad market impact. This circular affects only NSE trading members who rely on Sify-provided leased line connectivity (managed or self-service) to access NSE systems. Members should update their internal helpdesk contacts with the latest Sify escalation matrix to ensure timely resolution of connectivity issues. No impact on trading rules, margins, or listed securities.
