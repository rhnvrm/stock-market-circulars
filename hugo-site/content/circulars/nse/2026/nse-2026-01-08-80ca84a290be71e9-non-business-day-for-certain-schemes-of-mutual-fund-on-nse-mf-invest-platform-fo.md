## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:**
- Limited to investors in specific international and global equity schemes
- Likely related to holidays in underlying markets (US markets closed on January 20, 2026 for Martin Luther King Jr. Day; Japanese markets may have holiday considerations)
- Investors with systematic plans (SIP/STP/SWP) scheduled on these dates will have their transactions skipped for that installment
- No impact on schemes investing in domestic Indian markets

**Market Impact:**
- Minimal overall market impact as this affects only specific international/global schemes
- Routine occurrence when underlying international markets are closed for holidays
- Investors should plan redemptions or subscriptions around these dates if immediate execution is required
