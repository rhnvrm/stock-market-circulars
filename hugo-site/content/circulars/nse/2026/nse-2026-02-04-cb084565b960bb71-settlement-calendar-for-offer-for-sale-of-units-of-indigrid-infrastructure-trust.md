## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium operational impact limited to participants in the IndiGrid Infrastructure Trust OFS. Members and custodians dealing with this specific OFS must ensure compliance with the specified settlement calendar and timing requirements. The differentiated margin requirements (100% vs 0%) and confirmation timings create operational complexities that require careful coordination.
