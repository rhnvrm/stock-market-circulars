## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market-wide impact as it is a routine NFO launch announcement. The fund is a Specialized Investment Fund (SIF) which typically caters to a specific investor segment. The hybrid long-short strategy offers an alternative investment option for investors seeking both long and short equity exposure. Impact is primarily limited to investors interested in alternative investment strategies and does not affect broader market operations or existing securities.
