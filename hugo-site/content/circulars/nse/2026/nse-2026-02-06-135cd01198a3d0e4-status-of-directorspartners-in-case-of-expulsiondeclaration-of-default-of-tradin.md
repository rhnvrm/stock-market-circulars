## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it pertains to an administrative update regarding a member that was already expelled in 2019. The information is relevant for compliance and record-keeping purposes for trading members. The directors listed may face restrictions on their ability to be associated with other trading members as per regulatory provisions governing expelled/defaulter members. This is primarily an informational update following judicial proceedings at the SAT level.
