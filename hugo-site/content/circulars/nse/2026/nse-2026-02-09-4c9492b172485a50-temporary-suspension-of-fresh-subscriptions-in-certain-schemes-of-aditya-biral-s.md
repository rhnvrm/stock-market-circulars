title: Temporary Suspension of Fresh Subscriptions in Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual
  Fund Schemes
---

## Summary

NSE has disabled fresh subscriptions for three international equity schemes of Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund on the NSE MF Invest Platform effective February 10, 2026. The suspension applies to fresh subscriptions, switch-ins, and new SIP/STP registrations. Existing SIPs/STPs registered before the effective date will continue to be processed, and redemptions, SWPs, switch-outs, and STP-outs remain unrestricted.

## Key Points

- Fresh subscriptions and switch-in applications received after cutoff timing on February 10, 2026 will not be processed
- No fresh registrations under SIP and STP will be accepted from the effective date
- No units will be allotted under SIP/STP installments falling on or after February 10, 2026
- Existing SIP/STP registered prior to the effective date will continue to be processed
- Redemptions, Systematic Withdrawal Plans (SWP), switch-out, and STP-out transactions remain operational without restrictions
- Three international equity schemes affected: International Equity Fund, Global Emerging Opportunities Fund, and Global Excellence Equity Fund of Fund

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is an operational action by the Asset Management Company (AMC) communicated through NSE to temporarily restrict inflows into specific schemes while maintaining investor exit options.

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must ensure fresh subscription applications for the three specified schemes are not processed after February 10, 2026 cutoff
- Members should communicate the suspension to investors attempting fresh subscriptions or new SIP/STP registrations
- Continue processing existing SIP/STP installments registered before the effective date
- Ensure all redemption and withdrawal requests are processed normally
- Update scheme information documents (SID) and key information memorandums (KIM) to reflect the changes

## Important Dates

- **February 9, 2026**: Circular issued by NSE; Notice-cum-Addendum issued by Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC
- **February 10, 2026**: Effective date for suspension of fresh subscriptions, switch-ins, and new SIP/STP registrations

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Moderate impact on investors planning new investments in these international equity schemes. Existing investors can continue their SIPs and have full redemption flexibility. Investors seeking exposure to international markets through Aditya Birla Sun Life MF will need to consider alternative schemes.

**Market Impact**: Limited market-wide impact as this affects only three schemes of one AMC. The suspension likely indicates the AMC's portfolio management decision to control fund size or manage international market exposures.

**Operational Impact**: NSE MF Invest Platform and distributors must update systems to block fresh subscriptions while maintaining existing transaction processing. Clear communication to investors is essential to avoid confusion about subscription rejections.
