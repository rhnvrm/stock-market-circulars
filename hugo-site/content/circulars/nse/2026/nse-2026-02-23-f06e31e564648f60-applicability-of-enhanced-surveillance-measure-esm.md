## Regulatory Changes

This circular references and operates under the existing ESM framework established via earlier circulars: NSE/SURV/56948 (June 02, 2023), NSE/SURV/57609 (July 18, 2023), NSE/SURV/63361 (August 09, 2024), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), NSE/SURV/64400 (October 04, 2024), and NSE/SURV/69315 (July 25, 2025). No new regulatory framework is introduced; this circular applies the existing ESM criteria to newly qualifying securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- **NSE Members**: Must note the updated ESM securities list and enforce applicable margin requirements (minimum 100%) for BLBLIMITED on all open and new positions.
- **Market Participants**: Must comply with Trade-for-Trade settlement restrictions for BLBLIMITED from February 25, 2026.
- **Stage II Securities**: Must be traded under Periodic Call Auction with a 2% price band from February 24, 2026.
- Members may direct queries to surveillance@nse.co.in.

## Important Dates

- **February 23, 2026**: Circular issuance date.
- **February 24, 2026**: ESM Stage I inclusion effective date for BLBLIMITED; Stage II price band (2%) under Periodic Call Auction becomes applicable; 100% margin applies to all open positions as of this date.
- **February 25, 2026**: BLBLIMITED shifts from EQ/SM (Rolling Settlement) to BE/ST (Trade-for-Trade) segment; 100% margin applies to all new positions from this date.

## Impact Assessment

**BLBLIMITED (BLB Limited)**: Directly and significantly impacted — trading shifts to Trade-for-Trade, 100% margin is mandatory, and liquidity will be constrained. Investors holding or trading this security must ensure full margin availability.

**Consolidated ESM List**: The framework continues to cover multiple securities at Stage II including CBAZAAR (Net Avenue Technologies Limited), CURAA (Cura Technologies Limited), DHARIWAL (Dhariwalcorp Limited), and others. These continue to face restrictive trading conditions.

**Broader Market**: Limited systemic impact; ESM is a targeted surveillance tool. NSE explicitly notes that ESM shortlisting is a market surveillance action and should not be construed as an adverse action against the company or entity.
