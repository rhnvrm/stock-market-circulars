- Cancellation effective date: January 20, 2026
- Scheme: Selective Reduction of Capital between the Company and its shareholders and creditors
- The cancellation covers shares across multiple distinctive number ranges as detailed in Annexure I

## Important Dates

- **January 19, 2026**: Circular issued by NSE
- **January 20, 2026**: Effective date of share cancellation and extinguishment

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The cancellation of 1.45 million shares will reduce the outstanding share capital of Keynote Financial Services Limited, potentially affecting the stock's float and liquidity. This is a selective reduction targeting shares held by Keynote Trust rather than a broad-based buyback.

**Shareholder Impact**: Only affects Keynote Trust as the holder of the cancelled shares. Other shareholders are not directly impacted by the extinguishment, though the reduced share base may affect ownership percentages and voting rights proportionally.

**Corporate Governance**: The court-approved scheme demonstrates compliance with statutory requirements under the Companies Act, 2013 and NCLT Rules, 2016, providing legal certainty to the capital reduction process.
