## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Inform all clients about the commencement of trading in REs, mentioning the ISIN (INE788H20025)
- Clarify to clients that REs should not be mistaken for ordinary shares
- Include a prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases stating:
  - Purchase of REs only gives the right to participate in the ongoing Rights Issue by making an application with requisite application money OR renounce the REs before issue closes
  - REs which are neither subscribed nor renounced on or before the Issue Closing Date shall lapse and be extinguished

**For Investors:**

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** January 01, 2026
- **Effective Date:** January 05, 2026

- **Suspension Date:** January 08, 2026
- **Issue Closing Date:** On or before which REs must be subscribed or renounced to avoid lapsing

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Limited to shareholders of Hilton Metal Forging Limited who hold Rights Entitlements. The 3-day trading window provides a brief opportunity for renunciation.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure proper client communication and disclaimer inclusion in contract notes. The Trade to Trade segment classification requires settlement on a T+1 basis with no intraday squaring off.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders must act within the short trading window (3 days) to either trade their REs or make decisions about subscription. Failure to act will result in lapsing of entitlements after the Issue Closing Date.
