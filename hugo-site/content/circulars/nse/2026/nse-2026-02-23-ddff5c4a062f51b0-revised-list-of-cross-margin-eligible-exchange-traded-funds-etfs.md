## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited (NCL) has issued a revised list of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) eligible for cross margining in the Futures & Options segment. This circular (Ref. No. 0026/2026, Download Ref: NCL/CMPT/72953) supersedes the previous list issued via circular 0012/2026 dated January 23, 2026. The revised list of 31 eligible ETFs, along with their respective minimum quantity requirements, comes into effect from **February 25, 2026**.

## Key Points

- Revised list replaces the earlier eligible ETF list from circular 0012/2026 (NCL/CMPT/72473) dated January 23, 2026.

This update primarily impacts institutional and retail F&O traders who use the cross margining facility to reduce margin requirements by pledging ETF holdings. Members must verify that their cross margin portfolios comply with the revised list and updated minimum quantities before February 25, 2026. ETFs with high minimum quantities (e.g., BSLNIFTY at 65,000 units, PHARMABEES and MIDCAPETF at 25,000 units) may require larger capital commitments for cross margin eligibility.
