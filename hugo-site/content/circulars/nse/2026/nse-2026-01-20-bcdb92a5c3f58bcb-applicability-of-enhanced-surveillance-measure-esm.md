## Summary

These securities - Ausom Enterprise Limited (AUSOMENT), Best Agrolife Limited (BESTAGRO), Milton Industries Limited (MILTON), and SMVD Poly Pack Limited (SMVD) - will be subject to minimum 100% margin requirement and shifted from Rolling Settlement segment to Trade-for-Trade segment. This measure is applied purely on account of market surveillance and should not be construed as adverse action against the companies.

- No securities moving between Stage I and Stage II
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Action is purely surveillance-based, not adverse action against companies
