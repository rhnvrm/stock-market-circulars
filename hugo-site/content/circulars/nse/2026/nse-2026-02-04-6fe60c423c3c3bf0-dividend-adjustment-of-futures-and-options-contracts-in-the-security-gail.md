## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** All existing Futures and Options positions in GAIL will be adjusted to reflect the dividend payment. Option strike prices will be reduced by Rs 5/-, affecting 66+ option strike prices listed in the circular's annexure. The adjustment ensures fair pricing post-dividend but requires traders to update their systems and understand the new strike prices.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure their systems are updated with new contract specifications before market opening on February 05, 2026. Failure to update could result in pricing errors or trade rejections. The adjustment follows standard procedures, minimizing operational disruption for members familiar with corporate action adjustments.

**Trading Impact:** Traders holding GAIL F&O positions should note that their contracts will be automatically adjusted. Open interest will be transferred to adjusted strikes. The strike price range from 136-167 (old) becomes 131-162 (revised) for February 24, 2026 expiry contracts.
