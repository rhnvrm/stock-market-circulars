## Summary

NSE has announced changes in ISIN codes for two ETFs of Groww Mutual Fund - Groww Gold ETF and Groww Silver ETF. The change is effective from February 06, 2026 and is necessitated by the sub-division of face value from Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/- for both ETFs.

## Key Points

- GROWWGOLD (Groww Gold ETF) will have new ISIN: INF666M01OE7
- GROWWSLVR (Groww Silver ETF) will have new ISIN: INF666M01OF4
- Both ETFs undergoing face value sub-division from Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/-
- New ISINs effective for all trades from ex-date February 06, 2026
- Change applies to equity shares of the ETFs

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is an administrative update related to corporate action (face value sub-division) undertaken by Groww Mutual Fund for its two ETF schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must use the new ISIN codes for all trades executed on and from February 06, 2026
- Settlement systems must be updated to reflect the new ISIN codes
- Existing holdings will be adjusted to reflect the 1:10 sub-division ratio

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: February 04, 2026
- **Ex-Date**: February 06, 2026 (new ISINs become effective)

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these ETFs will see their holdings adjusted to reflect the face value split. Each unit of Rs. 10/- face value will be converted to 10 units of Re. 1/- face value. The total investment value remains unchanged.

**Trading Impact**: Traders must use the new ISIN codes for transactions from February 06, 2026 onwards. The sub-division typically makes the ETF units more affordable and may improve liquidity.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers, depository participants, and market participants need to update their systems to reflect the new ISIN codes and ensure smooth settlement of trades post ex-date.
