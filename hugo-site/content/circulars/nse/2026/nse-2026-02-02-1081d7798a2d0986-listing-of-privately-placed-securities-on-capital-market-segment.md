## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it relates to the routine listing of two privately placed debt securities. The listing expands the available debt instruments on NSE's Capital Market segment. Impact is limited to investors interested in corporate bonds (Lloyds Metals) and public sector bonds (NABARD). The securities are privately placed, indicating institutional investor participation rather than retail market impact.
