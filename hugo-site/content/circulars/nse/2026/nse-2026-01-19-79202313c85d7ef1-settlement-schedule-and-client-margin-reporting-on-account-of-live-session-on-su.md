Pay-in/pay-out transactions for February 01 trades will be settled on February 02, 2026 in sequential rounds alongside the regular settlement due that day.

## Key Points

- Special trading session scheduled on Sunday, February 01, 2026 for Union Budget presentation
- Pay-in/pay-out for February 01 trades will be settled on February 02, 2026
- Two sequential settlement rounds on February 02: trades from January 30 (1st round) and February 01 (2nd round)
- Both settlement rounds will have pay-in time at 9:00 hrs on February 02, 2026
- Modified client margin reporting sign-off dates from February 01-06, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must adhere to sequential settlement schedule on February 02, 2026
- Pay-in transactions for both settlement rounds must be completed by 9:00 hrs on February 02
- Client margin reporting must follow the revised sign-off schedule
- Members should prepare systems for handling two settlement rounds on the same day

## Important Dates

- **February 01, 2026**: Special live trading session (Sunday)
- **February 02, 2026**: Dual settlement rounds - trades from January 30 (1st) and February 01 (2nd) at 9:00 hrs

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Members need to adjust operational processes to handle two settlement rounds on the same day (February 02). System configurations and staffing arrangements must accommodate the sequential settlement process.

**Market Impact**: Low - This is purely an operational adjustment that does not affect trading rules or margin requirements. The sequential settlement approach ensures orderly processing of obligations.

**Compliance Impact**: Medium - Members must track and adhere to modified timelines for both settlements and client margin reporting. Failure to meet the 9:00 hrs pay-in deadline for either round could result in penalties.

**Reference**: This circular refers to NSE circular no. 07/2025 (Download Ref No. NSE/FAOP/72352) dated January 16, 2026 regarding the Live Trading session announcement.
