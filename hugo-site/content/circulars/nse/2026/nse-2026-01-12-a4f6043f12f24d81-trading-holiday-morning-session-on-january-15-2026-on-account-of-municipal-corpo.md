title: Trading Holiday (Morning Session) on January 15, 2026 - Municipal Corporation
  Election in Maharashtra - Commodity Derivatives Segment
---

## Summary

NSE has announced a partial trading holiday for the Commodity Derivatives segment on January 15, 2026, due to Municipal Corporation Elections in Maharashtra. This circular partially modifies the earlier notification (NSE/COM/71784 dated December 15, 2025). The morning trading session will be closed, while the evening session will operate normally from 17:00 to 23:55 hours.

## Key Points

- Morning session of Commodity Derivatives segment will be closed on January 15, 2026
- Evening trading session will remain open and operational
- This is a partial modification to the earlier circular NSE/COM/71784 dated December 15, 2025
- The closure is due to Municipal Corporation Election in Maharashtra
- Only the Commodity Derivatives (COM) segment is affected by this circular

## Regulatory Changes

This circular modifies the previously announced trading schedule for January 15, 2026. The original circular reference NSE/COM/71784 dated December 15, 2025 is partially modified to reflect the partial trading day instead of a complete holiday.

## Compliance Requirements

- All members of the Commodity Derivatives segment must note the modified trading hours
- Members should inform their clients about the morning session closure
- Members must ensure readiness for evening session trading operations
- No trading activity should be scheduled during the closed morning session

## Important Dates

- **January 15, 2026**: Partial trading holiday
  - Morning Session: Closed (entire morning session)
  - Evening Session: Open from 17:00 hours to 23:55 hours
- **Circular Date**: January 12, 2026
- **Reference Circular**: NSE/COM/71784 dated December 15, 2025 (partially modified)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium impact on commodity derivatives trading. While morning session closure will affect traders who typically operate during standard hours, the availability of evening session trading from 17:00 to 23:55 hours provides approximately 7 hours of trading opportunity, which partially mitigates the disruption.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to adjust their operational schedules and inform clients about the modified trading hours. Risk management systems and position monitoring should be adjusted for the condensed trading day.

**Geographic Scope**: This trading holiday is specific to Maharashtra's Municipal Corporation Election and affects the NSE Commodity Derivatives segment. The evening session allows for continued price discovery and risk management capabilities for commodity derivatives market participants.
