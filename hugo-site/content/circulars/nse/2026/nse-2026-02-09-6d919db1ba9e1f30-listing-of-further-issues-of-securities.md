## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected as this is a routine administrative listing of ESOP-allotted shares. The quantum of shares is relatively small compared to the outstanding equity of these established companies. No trading restrictions or lock-in periods apply, allowing immediate liquidity. This reflects normal employee compensation practices and represents minor dilution for existing shareholders.
