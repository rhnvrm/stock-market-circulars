---

## Summary

NSE has conducted a periodic review of securities under the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework in coordination with other exchanges. Seven securities have been found eligible to move to lower GSM stages effective February 09, 2026. This relaxation indicates improved compliance or risk metrics for the affected securities. Three securities (SADBHAV, BLUECHIP, and GLFL) will also see their trading series upgraded from BE to EQ.

## Key Points

- 7 securities eligible for lower GSM stages effective February 09, 2026
- Review conducted in coordination with other exchanges as per GSM framework provisions
- 3 securities moving from GSM Stage II to Stage I with series change from BE to EQ
- 4 securities moving down by one GSM stage (from Stage III to II, and Stage IV to III)
- Circular references previous GSM framework circulars dating back to February 2017

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements the existing periodic review mechanism under the GSM framework established through:

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: February 06, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 09, 2026 - New GSM stages become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact**: Securities moving to lower GSM stages face reduced surveillance restrictions, potentially improving liquidity and investor sentiment. The series change from BE to EQ for SADBHAV, BLUECHIP, and GLFL represents a significant upgrade in trading status.

**Securities Details**:
- **Stage II to I** (with BE to EQ upgrade): SADBHAV ENGINEERING LIMITED, BLUE CHIP INDIA LIMITED, GUJARAT LEASE FINANCING LIMITED
- **Stage III to II**: SUPREME ENGINEERING LIMITED (Series BZ)
- **Stage IV to III**: GAYATRI PROJECTS LIMITED (Series BZ), GRAND FOUNDRY LIMITED (Series BE), UNIVA FOODS LIMITED (Series BE)

Lower GSM stages generally indicate reduced surveillance concerns and may result in lower Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) requirements and fewer trading restrictions for these securities.
