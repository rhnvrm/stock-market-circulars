title: Applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework, adding two securities to Stage I effective January 21, 2026. IFCI Limited and Owais Metal And Mineral Processing Limited will be subject to enhanced margin requirements of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at 100%. Additionally, Ahlada Engineers Limited and Ausom Enterprise Limited are being excluded from the ASM framework.

## Key Points

- Two securities added to ST-ASM Stage I: IFCI Limited (INE039A01010) and Owais Metal And Mineral Processing Limited (INE0R8M01017)
- No securities added to ST-ASM Stage II
- No securities moving between stages
- Two securities excluded from ASM framework: Ahlada Engineers Limited and Ausom Enterprise Limited (moved to ESM framework)
- Margin rate of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at 100%
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance purposes and not an adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework as per previous Exchange circulars (NSE/SURV/39265, NSE/SURV/46557, NSE/SURV/52144, NSE/SURV/58558, and NSE/SURV/64066). The ST-ASM framework is designed to monitor securities showing unusual trading patterns or price movements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must apply applicable margin of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher) on all open positions as on January 21, 2026
- Same margin requirements apply to new positions created from January 22, 2026 onwards
- Maximum margin rate is capped at 100%
- Members must ensure compliance with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- For queries, members can contact surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **January 20, 2026**: Circular issued
- **January 21, 2026**: Securities included in ST-ASM Stage I (effective date)
- **January 22, 2026**: Enhanced margin requirements applicable on all positions

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Traders holding positions in IFCI and OWAIS will face significantly higher margin requirements, potentially reducing leverage and trading volumes in these securities. The 50% minimum margin requirement may lead to position closures or reduced participation.

**Market Impact**: Limited to two securities, so broader market impact is minimal. However, affected stocks may experience increased volatility as traders adjust positions to meet margin requirements.

**Positive Development**: Two securities (AHLADA and AUSOMENT) are being excluded from ASM framework, allowing normal trading conditions to resume for these stocks.

**Investor Awareness**: Exchange clarifies that ASM inclusion is a surveillance measure and should not be interpreted as adverse action against the companies, helping prevent negative perception impact.
