## Summary

NSE has announced surveillance actions moving securities to Trade for Trade (T2T) segment effective February 05, 2026. PARAS PETROFILS LIMITED will be shifted from rolling segment (EQ series) to T2T segment (BE series) with a 5% or lower price band. The circular also lists securities continuing under T2T surveillance. All T2T securities will have trade-to-trade settlement with no netting off allowed.

## Key Points

- PARAS PETROFILS LIMITED (PARASPETRO) moved to T2T segment (BE series) due to Price Earnings Multiple, Price Variation & Market Capitalization criteria
- No securities from SM series being moved to ST series in this review
- 3 securities continue in BE/BZ series: SAB EVENTS & GOVERNANCE NOW MEDIA LIMITED, KSR FOOTWEAR LIMITED, and LANCOR HOLDINGS LIMITED
- 2 securities continue in ST/SZ series: SABAR FLEX INDIA LIMITED and VILIN BIO MED LIMITED
- Securities will be removed from rolling segment (EQ/SM series) and only available in T2T segment
- Price band of 5% or lower applies to all affected securities
- Settlement on trade-to-trade basis with no netting off permitted

## Regulatory Changes

In pursuance of Capital Market Segment Trading Regulations Part - A, 2.6, the Exchange has implemented movement of securities based on surveillance review. The action is purely for market safety and investor protection, and should not be construed as adverse action against the concerned companies.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must take adequate precaution while trading in T2T securities
- No netting off will be allowed in settlement
- Members should note affected securities are not available in rolling segment from effective date
- Queries should be directed to surveillance@nse.co.in
- Members should refer to NSE website for criteria on shifting securities to/from T2T segment: https://www.nseindia.com/regulations/movement-securities-periodic-review

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: February 02, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 05, 2026 (Thursday)

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Trading**: Movement to T2T segment significantly impacts liquidity and trading patterns. Securities in T2T segment experience:
- Reduced liquidity due to mandatory delivery-based settlement
- No intraday squaring off or netting of positions
- Limited to 5% or lower daily price movement
- Higher capital requirement as all trades must result in delivery
- Potential for reduced trading volumes

**Affected Securities**: PARASPETRO faces immediate impact with existing rolling segment positions needing attention before February 05, 2026. Continuing T2T securities (SABEVENTS, KSR, LANCORHOL, SABAR, VILINBIO) remain under surveillance measures.

**Market Safety Measure**: The action is part of NSE's fortnightly surveillance review to ensure market safety and protect investor interests in securities exhibiting specific risk criteria.
