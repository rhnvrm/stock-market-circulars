## Regulatory Changes

The OFS is being conducted in accordance with the Interoperability among Clearing Corporations framework as per exchange circular NSE/CMTR/72975 dated February 24, 2026. No standalone new regulatory framework is introduced; this circular operationalizes an existing scheme for the specific IRFC OFS event.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must ensure compliant UCCs (for self/PRO and clients) are updated in the Unique Client Identification (UCI) system at least one day prior to the OFS bidding session.
- Members or clients whose UCC becomes compliant on the day of the OFS bidding session will not be permitted to participate; orders will not be accepted.
- UCCs identified as compliant for the Capital Market segment by 10:00 PM on the previous day will be considered permitted to trade for the next bidding day.
- Members must ensure sufficient collaterals before initiating carry-forward of orders on T+1 day. Orders rejected once due to insufficient margins cannot be re-placed.
- Members should refer to Annexure 3 of circular NSE/CMTR/43529 dated February 13, 2020 for features and limit settings for their users.

## Important Dates

- **February 24, 2026**: Circular issued; Admin user ID requests received after 3:00 PM processed next day by 8:45 AM.
- **February 25, 2026**: OFS Day 1 (bidding session); seller to intimate Exchange on oversubscription exercise intention by 5:00 PM.
- **February 26, 2026**: OFS Day 2 (bidding session).
- **Day prior to OFS**: Deadline for updating compliant UCCs in the UCI system.

## Impact Assessment

This is a significant market event involving a large government-owned entity (IRFC). The combined offer size (base + oversubscription) could amount to over 52 crore equity shares, making it a high-impact liquidity event for the capital markets. Trading members and their clients wishing to participate must act immediately to ensure UCC compliance and adequate collateral levels before February 25, 2026. Failure to meet UCC or collateral requirements will result in exclusion from bidding. The use of the interoperable clearing mechanism adds operational complexity that members should prepare for in advance.
