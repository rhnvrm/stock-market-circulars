## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal to negligible. The listing of ESOP shares is a routine administrative process with no direct trading restrictions or special conditions. The quantities being listed are relatively small compared to the total outstanding shares of most companies involved, particularly for large-cap entities like ICICI Bank and Wipro.

**Operational Impact:** Standard operational update for trading members to update their systems with new security codes and distinctive number ranges. No changes to trading mechanisms or lot sizes (all remain at 1 share market lot).

**Shareholder Impact:** Dilution effect is minimal given the small quantities relative to existing share capital. All shares are pari passu with no preferential rights, ensuring equal treatment with existing shareholders.
