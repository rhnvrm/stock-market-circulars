## Summary

The National Stock Exchange has moved Supreme Engineering Limited (Symbol: SUPREMEENG, ISIN: INE319Z01021) to Stage III of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective January 8, 2026. This action imposes stringent trading restrictions including trade-for-trade settlement, weekly trading only (Mondays or first trading day), 5% price band, and 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit requirement for buyers.

## Key Points

- Supreme Engineering Limited moved to GSM Stage III effective January 8, 2026
- Trading permitted only once a week (every Monday or first trading day of the week)
- Trade-for-trade basis with no netting off allowed
- Price band restricted to 5% or lower
- 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) required from buyers
- Settlement on trade-to-trade basis only
- Members advised to take adequate precautions while trading

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements Stage III surveillance measures under the GSM framework previously established through circulars NSE/SURV/34262 (February 23, 2017), NSE/SURV/38389 (July 20, 2018), NSE/SURV/42790 (November 29, 2019), NSE/SURV/59425 (November 17, 2023), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), and NSE/SURV/71670 (December 5, 2025).

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must ensure trades in SUPREMEENG comply with weekly trading restrictions (Mondays/first trading day only)
- **Buyers**: Must deposit 100% ASD of trade value
- **Settlement**: All trades must be settled on trade-to-trade basis with no netting off
- **Price Limits**: Adhere to 5% or lower price band as applicable
- **Risk Management**: Members must take adequate precautions given the restricted trading environment

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: January 7, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 8, 2026
- **Trading Frequency**: Every Monday or first trading day of each week starting January 8, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The movement to GSM Stage III represents the third-highest surveillance level and significantly restricts liquidity for Supreme Engineering Limited. The weekly-only trading window drastically reduces trading opportunities compared to daily trading.

**Investor Impact**: Buyers face substantial capital commitment requirements with 100% ASD, while both buyers and sellers experience reduced liquidity and limited price discovery due to the 5% price band and weekly trading restriction. The trade-for-trade settlement eliminates position netting flexibility.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must implement controls to prevent unauthorized trades outside the permitted Monday/first trading day window and ensure proper ASD collection from buyers. The lack of netting increases settlement obligations and capital requirements for market participants.

**Escalation Risk**: Stage III is one level below Stage IV (the most restrictive level), which additionally prohibits upward price movement. Continued concerns could lead to further restrictions or potential suspension.
