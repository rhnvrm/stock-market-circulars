title: Face Value Split of Quantum Nifty 50 ETF from Rs. 10 to Re. 1
---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has announced a face value split for the Quantum Nifty 50 ETF (Symbol: QNIFTY) managed by Quantum Asset Management Company Private Limited. The face value and paid-up value will be reduced from Rs. 10 to Re. 1, representing a 1:10 split ratio, effective from February 13, 2026.

## Key Points

- ETF affected: Quantum Nifty 50 ETF (QNIFTY)
- Current face value and paid-up value: Rs. 10
- New face value and paid-up value: Re. 1
- Split ratio: 1:10 (each unit will be split into 10 units)
- Asset Management Company: Quantum Asset Management Company Private Limited
- Circular issued by: Ruchi Jaiswal, Manager, NSE Listing Department

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action involving denomination change of ETF units.

## Compliance Requirements

- Exchange members must update their systems to reflect the new face value and paid-up value
- Trading and settlement systems must be adjusted to accommodate the split
- Investor portfolios will automatically reflect the increased number of units at proportionately reduced price

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: February 04, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 13, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The face value split will make the ETF units more affordable for retail investors by reducing the per-unit price to one-tenth of the current value. Existing investors will hold 10 units for every 1 unit previously held, with no change to their total investment value.

**Liquidity Impact**: Lower per-unit price typically enhances liquidity and makes the ETF more accessible to smaller investors, potentially increasing trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: This is a neutral corporate action for existing unitholders - while the number of units increases 10-fold, the per-unit price decreases proportionately, maintaining the same total investment value. No action is required from investors as the adjustment happens automatically.
