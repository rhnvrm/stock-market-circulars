## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact (Medium):**
Commodity derivatives segment members need to adjust their settlement operations to accommodate the Sunday trading session. Staff and systems must be available on Sunday (February 01) for trading and on Monday (February 02) for dual settlement rounds.

**Market Impact (Low to Medium):**
The special trading session allows market participants to respond to Union Budget announcements in real-time. The compressed settlement and margin reporting timeline requires careful operational planning by members.

**Compliance Impact (Medium):**
Members must ensure their back-office systems and processes are configured for the modified settlement schedule and extended client margin reporting sign-off dates. Contact details provided: Phone 1800 266 0050 (IVR Option 2), Email: fao_clearing_ops@nsccl.co.in for queries.
