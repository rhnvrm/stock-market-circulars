## Regulatory Changes

This circular is issued in reference to prior Exchange Circulars: NSE/SURV/56948 (June 02, 2023), NSE/SURV/57609 (July 18, 2023), NSE/SURV/63361 (August 09, 2024), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), NSE/SURV/64400 (October 04, 2024), and NSE/SURV/69315 (July 25, 2025). The ESM framework is an ongoing surveillance mechanism; this circular constitutes a periodic update adding two new securities to Stage I.

- **NSE Members** must ensure a minimum 100% margin is collected on all open positions in SADBHAV and SILKFLEX as on February 27, 2026, and on all new positions created from March 02, 2026
- Members must note the segment migration of SADBHAV and SILKFLEX from EQ/SM to BE/ST effective March 02, 2026, and update their trading systems accordingly
- Market participants holding or trading in ESM Stage II securities (CBAZAAR, CURAA) must comply with the 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- NSE has clarified that ESM inclusion is purely a market surveillance action and should not be construed as an adverse action against the concerned company/entity
- For queries, members may write to surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| February 27, 2026 | SADBHAV and SILKFLEX placed under ESM Stage I; 100% margin applies to open positions; Stage II Periodic Call Auction 2% price band effective |
| March 02, 2026 | SADBHAV and SILKFLEX shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade (BE/ST); 100% margin applies to all new positions |

## Impact Assessment

**High impact** on the directly named securities:

- **SADBHAV (Sadbhav Engineering Limited)** and **SILKFLEX (Silkflex Polymers (India) Limited)** face significantly reduced liquidity due to the shift to Trade-for-Trade segment, eliminating netting of positions and requiring 100% upfront margin. This typically deters speculative activity and can cause short-term price volatility.
- **CBAZAAR** and **CURAA** remain in Stage II with stricter 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction, severely limiting price discovery and intraday trading.
- Institutional and retail investors holding these securities should be aware of the increased margin burden and restricted settlement mechanism.
- The ESM framework aims to protect investors from excessive speculation in stocks exhibiting abnormal market behavior, but inclusion often results in temporary selling pressure due to increased compliance costs for brokers and traders.
