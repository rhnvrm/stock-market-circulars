- **Lock-in expiry (GPIL preferential shares):** September 10, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing of these further issues has a minimal market impact as they represent incremental dilution through ESOP allotments and one preferential issue across ten companies. The largest single issuance is GPIL's preferential allotment of 1,372,500 shares at Rs. 245, which is locked in until September 10, 2026 and thus will not immediately increase free float. ESOP allotments for the remaining companies are small relative to their overall share capital. Existing shareholders face minor dilution; no systemic or broad market effect is expected.
