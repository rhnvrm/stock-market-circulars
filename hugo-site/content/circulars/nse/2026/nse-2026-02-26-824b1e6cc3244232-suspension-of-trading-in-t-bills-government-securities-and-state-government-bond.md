## Impact Assessment

This is a routine, low-impact circular. The suspension of these 22 instruments is a natural consequence of their reaching maturity and does not indicate any market disruption or regulatory concern. Investors holding these securities will receive redemption proceeds as scheduled. No broader market impact is anticipated. The circular affects participants in the debt/government securities segment only.
