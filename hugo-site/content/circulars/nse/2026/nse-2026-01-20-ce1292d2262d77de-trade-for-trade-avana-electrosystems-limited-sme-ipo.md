## Impact Assessment

The segment transfer will enable normal intraday trading and settlement cycles for AVANA stock. This is a positive development for liquidity as the trade for trade segment requires full upfront payment and delivery, while the rolling segment allows for T+1 settlement. The impact is limited to this single SME stock and represents a routine post-IPO progression.
