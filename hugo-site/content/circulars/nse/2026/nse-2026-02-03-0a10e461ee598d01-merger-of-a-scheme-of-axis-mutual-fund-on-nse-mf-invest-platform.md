## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Existing investors in Axis CRISIL IBX SDL June 2034 Debt Index Fund will see their holdings transferred to Axis Gilt Fund. The investment strategy changes from a target maturity index fund tracking CRISIL IBX SDL Index June 2034 (focused on state government securities) to a broader gilt fund investing in government securities across maturities. Both schemes maintain moderate risk classification.

**Operational Impact**: NSE MF Invest platform requires scheme mapping updates. All systematic investment arrangements continue seamlessly without investor action. The merger simplifies Axis Mutual Fund's product lineup by consolidating two government securities-focused schemes.

**Risk Profile**: Both schemes carry relatively high interest rate risk and relatively low credit risk. The surviving scheme (Axis Gilt Fund) offers broader maturity exposure compared to the target maturity approach of the merging scheme.
