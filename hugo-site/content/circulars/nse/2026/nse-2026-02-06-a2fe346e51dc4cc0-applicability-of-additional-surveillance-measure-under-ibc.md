## Compliance Requirements

- Members must note the applicability of ASM IBC to CLC Industries Limited effective February 09, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: February 06, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 09, 2026 - ASM IBC Stage I applicability for CLC Industries Limited

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: CLC Industries Limited will face enhanced surveillance with potential price band restrictions and trading limitations under ASM IBC Stage I. This may result in reduced liquidity and increased volatility monitoring for the scrip.

**Market Impact**: Limited broader market impact as only one security is affected. The measure is company-specific and relates to insolvency proceedings.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in CLCIND should be aware of the enhanced surveillance status, which indicates the company is undergoing or has been subject to IBC proceedings. This does not constitute an adverse regulatory action but serves as an informational surveillance measure.

**Operational Impact**: The scrip will be subject to stage-based surveillance conditions, and any future movement between stages or exclusion will be communicated through subsequent circulars. Members should monitor for further updates regarding this security.
