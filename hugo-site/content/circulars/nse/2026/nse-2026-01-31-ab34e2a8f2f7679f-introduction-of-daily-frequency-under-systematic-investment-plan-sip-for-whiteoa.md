- Minimum installments required: 12
- STP cycle applicable on all business days
- Start date defaults to 5th business day following submission if not specified
- End date is perpetual unless specified, but registration ceases after three consecutive failed installments
- Trustees/AMC reserve the right to modify or discontinue this facility prospectively

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

This is a low-impact operational change that provides enhanced flexibility for mutual fund investors on the NSE MF Invest Platform. The introduction of daily frequency under SIP offers investors more granular investment options, particularly beneficial for those seeking to dollar-cost average on a more frequent basis. The impact is limited to investors of Whiteoak Mutual Fund who choose to utilize this new feature. No mandatory compliance changes are required for existing investors or market participants.
