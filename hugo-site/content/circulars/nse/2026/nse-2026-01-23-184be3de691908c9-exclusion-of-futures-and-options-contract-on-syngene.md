## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High impact on derivative traders using SYNGENE F&O contracts for trading or hedging purposes. Traders with positions in SYNGENE derivatives must plan exit strategies before March 2026 expiry. The removal affects liquidity in SYNGENE derivatives and eliminates hedging opportunities for institutional investors holding the underlying stock.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update risk management systems, margin calculators, and client communication regarding the phased exclusion. Portfolio hedging strategies involving SYNGENE will need restructuring using alternative instruments.
