## Regulatory Changes

The capital restructuring was implemented pursuant to a Resolution Plan approved by NCLT on May 12, 2023.

The company also underwent a name change from Spentex Industries Limited to CLC Industries Limited.

## Compliance Requirements

- Shareholding pattern filed under Regulation 31(1)(c) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015
- Capital Restructuring report submitted to NSE
- Updated shareholding disclosure showing promoter and public shareholding percentages
- Dematerialization compliance maintained at 99.95%

## Important Dates

- NCLT Order Date: May 12, 2023
- Date of Allotment/Extinguishment: January 12, 2024
- Shareholding Pattern Quarter Ended: January 28, 2026
- Trading Recommencement: Post-capital restructuring completion

## Impact Assessment

The recommencement of trading provides liquidity to existing shareholders after the capital restructuring process. With 90% of shares locked-in and promoter holding at 95%, the free float available for trading is limited to approximately 5% public shareholding. The high concentration of promoter holding and significant locked-in shares may result in lower liquidity and higher volatility in the counter. Investors should note the capital restructuring background and the company's emergence from the resolution plan approved by NCLT.
