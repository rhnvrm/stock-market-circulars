---

## Summary

NSE has issued surveillance measures under the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework, placing TechEra Engineering (India) Limited (Symbol: TECHERA, ISIN: INE0JQS01019) under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I effective February 6, 2026. The company has been moved from Short-Term ASM (STASM) to Long-Term ASM (LTASM) framework. A 100% margin requirement will apply to all positions starting February 10, 2026.

## Key Points

- TechEra Engineering (India) Limited moved from STASM to LTASM Framework Stage-I
- 100% margin rate applicable on all open positions and new positions from February 10, 2026
- Margin applies to positions as on February 9, 2026 and new positions created from February 10, 2026 onwards
- No securities qualified for Stage-IV (Trade-for-Trade) placement in this circular
- No securities moved between stages (Stage-I to Stage-II, Stage-II to Stage-III, etc.)
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework as established under previous NSE circulars (NSE/SURV/39265, NSE/SURV/45111, NSE/SURV/46557, NSE/SURV/48506, NSE/SURV/52090, NSE/SURV/63362, and NSE/SURV/64066). The measure escalates surveillance on TechEra Engineering from short-term to long-term framework, indicating sustained concerns requiring heightened monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must ensure 100% margin collection on TECHERA stock for all positions
- **Margin Collection**: Applicable to both existing open positions (as on February 9, 2026) and all new positions created from February 10, 2026
- **Investors/Traders**: Must maintain 100% upfront margin to trade or hold positions in TECHERA
- **Risk Management**: Members must update their risk management systems to reflect the enhanced margin requirements
- For queries, members can contact NSE at surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **February 5, 2026**: Circular issuance date
- **February 6, 2026**: Effective date for inclusion in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- **February 9, 2026**: Last day positions assessed for margin requirements
- **February 10, 2026**: 100% margin requirement becomes applicable on all positions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The 100% margin requirement will significantly reduce leverage availability for TECHERA stock, likely resulting in reduced trading volumes and liquidity. This creates substantial barriers for intraday traders and leveraged positions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading TECHERA will need to fund 100% of position value upfront, eliminating margin trading benefits. This may force position closures for traders unable to meet the full funding requirement.

**Stock-Specific Impact**: TECHERA's transition from STASM to LTASM indicates persistent surveillance concerns. The enhanced measure may create downward pressure on the stock price due to reduced market participation and increased trading costs.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers must update margin systems and communicate requirements to clients holding TECHERA positions before February 10, 2026 to avoid forced liquidations.

Note: NSE clarifies that ASM placement is a surveillance tool and should not be construed as adverse regulatory action against TechEra Engineering (India) Limited.
