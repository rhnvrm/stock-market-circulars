## Summary

NSE has communicated a Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) order dated February 13, 2026, in Appeal No. 32 of 2026, staying the one-year debarment of Vyas Jitendrakumar Hasmukhlal HUF (PAN: AAKHV6316C) in the matter of trading activities in the scrip of DU Digital Technologies Limited. The stay is conditional upon deposit of 50% of the penalty amount. SEBI has confirmed that the entity has paid the penalty of Rs. 5,00,000/- and directed compliance with the SAT order.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This circular updates the status of a prior SEBI debarment order (referenced in NSE circular NSE/INVG/72109 dated January 01, 2026) following a SAT stay order. The debarment of Vyas Jitendrakumar Hasmukhlal HUF is now conditionally stayed pending the outcome of the SAT appeal.

## Important Dates

- December 31, 2025: Original SEBI debarment order (QJA/MN/IVD/ID7/31947/2025-26)
- January 01, 2026: NSE circular NSE/INVG/72109 notifying the debarment
- February 13, 2026: SAT order staying the debarment conditionally
- February 25, 2026: NSE circular confirming penalty payment and SAT order compliance
- May 06, 2026: Next hearing date before SAT

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to the single HUF entity (Vyas Jitendrakumar Hasmukhlal HUF) whose debarment has been conditionally stayed. The entity carried out limited trades (one trade by the HUF, two by the associated appellant) in DU Digital Technologies Limited. With the penalty of Rs. 5,00,000/- paid and the stay granted, the entity may resume market participation pending the SAT appeal outcome on May 06, 2026. NSE members handling this entity's accounts should update their compliance records accordingly. Broader market impact on DU Digital Technologies scrip is minimal.
