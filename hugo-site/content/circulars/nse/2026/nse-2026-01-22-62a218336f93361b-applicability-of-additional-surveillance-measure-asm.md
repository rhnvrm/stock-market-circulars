## Summary

NSE has issued Circular No. 56/2026 regarding the inclusion of securities under the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework. Two securities - Capital Trust Limited (CAPTRUST) and Tridhya Tech Limited (TRIDHYA) - have been shortlisted under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I. A 100% margin requirement will be applicable on all open positions and new positions from January 28, 2026. No securities have been moved to Stage-IV or between other stages in this circular.

## Key Points

- Two securities added to Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I: Capital Trust Limited (CAPTRUST) and Tridhya Tech Limited (TRIDHYA)
- 100% margin requirement will apply on all open positions as on January 27, 2026 and new positions from January 28, 2026 onwards
- No securities qualified under Criteria VII for shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ) to Trade-for-Trade (BE) segment
- No securities moved between ASM stages (Stage-I to Stage-II, Stage-II to Stage-III, or to Stage-IV)
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely on account of market surveillance and should not be construed as adverse action against the companies

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The 100% margin requirement will significantly reduce leverage available for trading in CAPTRUST and TRIDHYA, likely resulting in reduced trading volumes and liquidity in these securities.

**Market Participants**: Traders and investors holding positions in these securities must arrange for full margin coverage, which may lead to position unwinding if adequate margins cannot be arranged.

**Securities Covered**:
- Capital Trust Limited (CAPTRUST) - ISIN: INE707C01018
- Tridhya Tech Limited (TRIDHYA) - ISIN: INE0LWY01029

**Surveillance Context**: The inclusion under ASM indicates these securities have met specific surveillance criteria, warranting enhanced monitoring and risk mitigation measures to protect market integrity.
