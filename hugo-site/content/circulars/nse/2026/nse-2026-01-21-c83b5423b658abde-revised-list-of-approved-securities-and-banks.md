- Trading members must ensure each security deposited does not exceed 25% of their total margin requirements
- Deposits must be within the overall permitted quantities specified for each security
- Securities must be from the approved list only for non-cash collateral purposes

## Important Dates

Circular issued: January 21, 2026
Effective date: Immediate (not explicitly stated, typical for such revisions)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - Routine administrative update
**Operational Impact**: Medium - Members need to review current collateral positions against updated permitted quantities
**Risk Management**: The 25% concentration limit per security helps diversify collateral risk across the clearing system
