## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Date of Allotment | February 25, 2026 |
| Circular Date | February 27, 2026 |
| Listing Effective Date | March 02, 2026 |
| Lock-in Expiry Date | March 03, 2027 |

## Impact Assessment

The listing adds approximately 59.5 million new units of ANZEN to the tradeable pool on NSE from March 02, 2026, which could increase liquidity. However, the one-year lock-in (until March 03, 2027) means these preferentially allotted units cannot be sold in the market immediately, limiting any near-term dilution impact on existing unitholders. At the issue price of Rs. 117, the total value of newly listed units is approximately Rs. 696.6 crore. Existing unitholders should note the pari passu nature of the new units, which means equal rights and entitlements with previously issued units.
