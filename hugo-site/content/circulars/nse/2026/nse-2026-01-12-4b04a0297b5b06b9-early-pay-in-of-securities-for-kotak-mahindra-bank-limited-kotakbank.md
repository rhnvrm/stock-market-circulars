## Summary

NSE Clearing has issued instructions for early pay-in (EPI) of Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited (KOTAKBANK) securities during the face value split corporate action. The stock will undergo sub-division from Rs 5 per share to Re 1 per share with record date and ex-date on January 14, 2026. Members must follow specific ISIN-based pay-in procedures on different settlement dates to ensure proper margin exemption and settlement.

## Key Points

- Face value split: Rs 5 per share to Re 1 per share (5:1 ratio)
- Record Date and Ex-Date: January 14, 2026
- Old ISIN: INE237A01028
- Members must use old ISIN for early pay-in on January 14-15, 2026
- New ISIN to be used from January 16, 2026 onwards
- Early pay-in quantity must be in old ISIN terms (e.g., 1 share in old ISIN for 5 shares sold)
- Client-wise allocation file should reflect actual traded quantity
- Block mechanism applies as per SEBI circular NCL/CMPT/53386 dated August 22, 2022

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements Item 10.18 'Early Pay-in of Securities for Margin Exemption' from the consolidated circular (Download Ref No: NCL/CMPT/67751) dated April 29, 2025. The specific process addresses the temporary ISIN transition period during corporate action to maintain proper settlement and margin exemption benefits.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Members/Market Participants:**
- Execute early pay-in instructions in Old ISIN (INE237A01028) for settlements on January 14-15, 2026
- Adjust quantity proportionally (1 old share = 5 new shares) when doing early pay-in
- Adhere to block mechanism requirements per NCL/CMPT/53386 circular
- Do NOT upload client-wise early pay-in allocation file when using block mechanism
- Switch to New ISIN for pay-in/early pay-in after record date (from January 16, 2026)

**For Custodians:**
- Provide early pay-in through pool account where applicable
- Upload client-wise early pay-in allocation details based on actual traded quantity (not adjusted quantity)
- Example: For 5 shares sold, allocation file shows 5 shares even though depository pay-in is 1 share in old ISIN

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact (High):**
Market participants must modify their operational procedures for a 3-day period to handle dual ISIN requirements. Incorrect ISIN usage or quantity adjustments will result in settlement failures and loss of margin exemption benefits.

**Trading Impact (High):**
All members trading KOTAKBANK during the transition period must implement special handling. The 5:1 split ratio requires careful quantity conversion for early pay-in while maintaining actual trade quantity for client allocations.

**Client Impact (Medium):**
Clients undertaking sale transactions must ensure their demat accounts have proper blocks in place. The conversion ratio affects margin calculations and settlement obligations during the transition period.
