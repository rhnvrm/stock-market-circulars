title: Imposition of Additional Margin on Silver and Gold Futures During Tender Period
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued a circular continuing the imposition of additional margin on Silver and Gold Futures contracts (all variants) during the tender period. This is a risk containment measure in partial modification to previous circular dated October 29, 2025. The additional margins range from 1% for Gold contracts to 4.50% for Silver contracts.

## Key Points

- Additional margin of 4.50% continues on Silver Futures (SILVERM, SILVERMIC) expiring January 30, 2026
- Additional margin of 1% continues on Gold Futures (GOLD, GOLD1G, GOLDGUINEA, GOLDM) expiring January 30, 2026 and February 5, 2026
- These margins apply during the Tender Period only
- This is issued as a risk containment measure
- Partially modifies previous circular no. 0344/2025 dated October 29, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Continuation of existing additional margin framework for commodity futures during tender period:

**Silver Futures Contracts:**
- SILVERM (Expiry: 30-01-2026): 4.50% additional margin
- SILVERMIC (Expiry: 30-01-2026): 4.50% additional margin

**Gold Futures Contracts:**
- GOLD (Expiry: 05-02-2026): 1.00% additional margin
- GOLD1G (Expiry: 05-02-2026): 1.00% additional margin
- GOLDGUINEA (Expiry: 30-01-2026): 1.00% additional margin
- GOLDM (Expiry: 05-02-2026): 1.00% additional margin

## Compliance Requirements

- All members trading in Silver and Gold Futures contracts must maintain the specified additional margins during tender periods
- Members must ensure adequate collateral coverage for positions in affected contracts
- Risk management systems should be updated to reflect these margin requirements

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** January 23, 2026
- **Silver Futures Expiry:** January 30, 2026
- **Gold Futures Expiry (GOLDGUINEA):** January 30, 2026
- **Gold Futures Expiry (GOLD, GOLD1G, GOLDM):** February 5, 2026
- Additional margins applicable during respective tender periods

## Impact Assessment

The continuation of additional margins affects commodity derivative traders holding positions in Silver and Gold futures during tender periods. The higher 4.50% margin on Silver contracts indicates elevated risk concerns compared to 1% on Gold contracts. This may impact:

- Increased capital requirements for position holders during tender period
- Potential reduction in open interest as traders may close positions to avoid higher margins
- Enhanced risk mitigation for the clearing corporation
- Short-term liquidity impact on traders holding deliverable positions

Members should factor these additional margin requirements into their trading and risk management strategies for commodity futures positions approaching tender period.
