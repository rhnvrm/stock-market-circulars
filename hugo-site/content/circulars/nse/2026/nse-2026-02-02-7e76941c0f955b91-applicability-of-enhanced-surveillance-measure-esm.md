title: Applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - February 2026
---

## Summary

NSE has updated its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework, adding two securities to Stage I effective February 03, 2026. The affected securities will attract a minimum 100% margin requirement and will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST) starting February 04, 2026. This surveillance action applies to both open positions as on February 03, 2026 and new positions created from February 04, 2026 onwards.

## Key Points

- Two securities added to ESM Stage I: Paras Petrofils Limited (PARASPETRO) and Vilin Bio Med Limited (VILINBIO)
- No securities moving between Stage I and Stage II
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework
- Securities shifting to Stage II will be under Trade for Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- This is a market surveillance action and not an adverse action against the companies

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements the following changes under the Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework:

1. **Stage I Additions**: PARASPETRO and VILINBIO newly included in ESM Stage I
2. **Segment Transfer**: Securities will move from Rolling Settlement (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST)
3. **Margin Requirements**: Minimum 100% margin applicable on all positions
4. **Stage II Requirements**: Securities in Stage II operate under Trade for Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction mechanism

## Compliance Requirements

**For Market Participants:**
- Ensure adequate margin coverage of 100% minimum for positions in affected securities
- Adjust trading strategies for Trade-for-Trade settlement requirement
- Monitor consolidated list of ESM securities (currently includes ANONDITA and DHARIWAL in Stage II)
- Comply with all prevailing surveillance measures applicable to these securities

**For Brokers/Trading Members:**
- Update risk management systems to reflect new margin requirements
- Communicate changes to clients holding positions in affected securities
- Direct queries to surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **February 02, 2026**: Circular issued (Circular Ref. No: 81/2026, Download Ref: NSE/SURV/72575)
- **February 03, 2026**: Securities added to ESM Stage I; 100% margin applicable on open positions; Stage II securities move to Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band
- **February 04, 2026**: 100% margin applicable on new positions; segment shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST effective

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:**
- Significantly reduced liquidity for PARASPETRO and VILINBIO due to Trade-for-Trade requirement
- Higher capital requirements for traders due to 100% margin mandate
- Limited intraday trading opportunities in affected securities
- Potential price volatility during transition period

**Market Impact:**
- Enhanced scrutiny indicates potential concerns about price movements or trading patterns
- Investor confidence may be affected in the short term
- Long-only investors less impacted compared to active traders

**Reference Information:**
- Consolidated ESM list includes Stage II securities: Anondita Medicare Limited (ANONDITA) and Dhariwalcorp Limited (DHARIWAL)
