## Summary

NSE has revised the date for shifting E To E Transportation Infrastructure Limited from the trade for trade segment (Series: ST) to the rolling segment (Series: SM). The transition will now occur on January 19, 2026, instead of the previously announced date of January 16, 2026. This revision pertains to the company's SME IPO listing.

## Key Points

- E To E Transportation Infrastructure Limited will move from trade for trade segment to rolling segment
- Revised effective date: January 19, 2026 (previously January 16, 2026)
- Series change: From ST (trade for trade) to SM (rolling segment)
- All other details from the original circular (NSE/CML/72127 dated January 02, 2026) remain unchanged
- This applies to the SME IPO of the company

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a date revision to an existing circular regarding segment classification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members should note the revised date for the segment transition
- Trading in E To E Transportation Infrastructure Limited will continue in trade for trade mode (Series: ST) until January 18, 2026
- From January 19, 2026, the stock will trade in rolling segment (Series: SM)

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** January 12, 2026
- **Original Transition Date:** January 16, 2026 (now revised)
- **Revised Transition Date:** January 19, 2026
- **Reference Circular:** NSE/CML/72127 dated January 02, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine administrative adjustment affecting only one SME stock. The three-day delay in segment transition provides members additional time but does not significantly alter trading operations. The shift from trade for trade to rolling segment typically indicates improved liquidity conditions for the stock post-IPO.
