title: Change in Collateral Timings - Revised Cut-off Times for Addition and Release
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has revised the timings for collateral addition and release in the debt segment based on member feedback. The changes extend the cut-off time for cash and Fixed Deposit Receipt (FDR) deposits to 7:30 PM and introduce a structured batch system for pledged securities release with multiple cut-off times throughout the day. These changes will be effective from January 19, 2026.

## Key Points

- Cut-off time for cash and FDR collateral deposits extended to 7:30 PM on all settlement days (previously earlier timing)
- Pledged securities release now available in 10 batches throughout the day with cut-off times ranging from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM
- Cash/FDR/Bank Guarantee immediate release requests accepted until 8:00 PM
- Cash/FDR/Bank Guarantee EOD/Value date release requests accepted until 8:00 PM
- Additional immediate release option for pledged securities available until 8:00 PM
- Special requirement: Repledge securities for pay-in must be requested one day prior, not on pay-in date
- Changes apply to all members, custodians, and PCMs in the debt segment

## Regulatory Changes

This circular supersedes the previous circular ref. no. 0122/2025 (Download Ref No: NCL/DS/67767 dated April 30, 2025) regarding collateral timings. The revision introduces:

1. **Extended Cash/FDR Addition Window**: Cut-off time moved to 7:30 PM on all settlement days

2. **Structured Batch Release System**: Introduction of 10 distinct batches for pledged securities with staggered cut-off times:
   - Batch 1: 9:00 AM
   - Batch 2: 9:30 AM
   - Batch 3: 10:00 AM
   - Batch 4: 12:00 PM
   - Batch 5: 2:00 PM
   - Batch 6: 3:00 PM
   - Batch 7: 4:00 PM
   - Batch 8: 5:00 PM
   - Batch 9: 6:00 PM
   - Batch 10: 7:00 PM

3. **Uniform 8:00 PM Cut-off**: All immediate and EOD release requests for cash, FDR, bank guarantees, and pledged securities accepted until 8:00 PM

## Compliance Requirements

**For Members/Custodians/PCM:**

1. Ensure cash and FDR deposits are made by 7:30 PM on settlement days to meet collateral requirements

2. Submit release requests for cash/FDR/bank guarantees by 8:00 PM for same-day processing

3. Plan pledged securities release requests according to the appropriate batch timing (9:00 AM to 7:00 PM)

4. **Critical Requirement**: For repledge securities needed for pay-in requirements, submit release requests one day prior to pay-in date, not on the pay-in date itself

5. Update internal systems and operational procedures to align with new timings

6. Coordinate with back-office teams to ensure compliance with extended cut-off times

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: January 16, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:**
- **Positive**: Extended timings provide greater flexibility for members to manage collateral requirements, particularly beneficial for end-of-day liquidity management
- **Efficiency**: Multiple batch options for pledged securities release allow better intraday collateral optimization
- **Resource Planning**: Members may need to extend operational hours to utilize the full window until 8:00 PM

**Risk Management:**
- Enhanced ability to meet margin requirements with extended deposit cut-off times
- Reduced risk of collateral shortfalls due to timing constraints
- Better liquidity management through multiple release windows

**Market Impact:**
- Low direct market impact as this is an operational/administrative change
- Improves operational efficiency in debt segment clearing and settlement
- Responds to member feedback, indicating industry-driven improvement

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Members have 3 days (January 16-19, 2026) to update systems and procedures
- Back-office teams need to adjust staffing for extended operational hours
- Technology systems may require configuration changes to accommodate new cut-off times
