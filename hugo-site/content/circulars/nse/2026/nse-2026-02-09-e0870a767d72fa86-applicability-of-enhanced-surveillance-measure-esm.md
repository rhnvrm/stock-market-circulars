## Summary

NSE has issued updates to its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective February 10-11, 2026. Three securities are being included in ESM Stage-I with 100% minimum margin requirement and shift to trade-for-trade segment. One security (SALSTEEL) is being moved from Stage-I to Stage-II with stricter 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction. No securities are being excluded from the ESM framework.

## Key Points

- Three securities added to ESM Stage-I: Medistep Healthcare Limited (MEDISTEP), Niraj Ispat Industries Limited (NIRAJISPAT), and Vijaypd Ceutical Limited (VIJAYPD)
- 100% minimum margin applicable on all open positions as on February 10, 2026 and new positions from February 11, 2026
- Securities shifting from Rolling Settlement segment (EQ/SM series) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST series) effective February 11, 2026
- S.A.L. Steel Limited (SALSTEEL) moving from Stage-I to Stage-II with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- No securities moving from Stage-II to Stage-I
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

The circular updates the Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework based on previous circulars NSE/SURV/56948 (June 02, 2023), NSE/SURV/57609 (July 18, 2023), NSE/SURV/63361 (August 09, 2024), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), NSE/SURV/64400 (October 04, 2024), and NSE/SURV/69315 (July 25, 2025).

Securities under ESM are subject to:
- Mandatory 100% margin requirement
- Trade-for-Trade settlement (no intraday squaring off)
- Stage-II securities additionally subject to 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- Shift from normal rolling settlement to restricted trading segments

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure 100% upfront margin for the listed securities effective February 11, 2026
- All open positions in affected securities as on February 10, 2026 must meet the enhanced margin requirement
- Trading members must comply with trade-for-trade settlement for MEDISTEP, NIRAJISPAT, and VIJAYPD
- SALSTEEL will trade under Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band restriction
- Members should refer to Annexure III for consolidated list of all securities under ESM framework

## Important Dates

- **February 09, 2026**: Circular issuance date
- **February 10, 2026**: 100% margin applicable on existing open positions; SALSTEEL moves to Stage-II with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- **February 11, 2026**: New securities shift to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST series); 100% margin applicable on new positions

## Impact Assessment

**High impact on affected securities**: The inclusion of securities in ESM framework significantly impacts trading liquidity and capital requirements. The 100% margin requirement substantially increases capital costs for traders and investors holding positions in these securities. The shift to trade-for-trade settlement eliminates intraday trading opportunities, further reducing liquidity.

**Stage-II implications**: SALSTEEL's movement to Stage-II represents escalated surveillance with the additional constraint of 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction, severely restricting price volatility and trading flexibility.

**Investor considerations**: The exchange clarifies that ESM inclusion is purely a market surveillance measure and should not be construed as adverse action against the companies. However, investors should exercise heightened caution and conduct thorough due diligence before trading in these securities.

**Capital allocation**: Market participants with existing positions must arrange for additional capital to meet the 100% margin requirement by February 10, 2026, or face potential position squaring-off.
