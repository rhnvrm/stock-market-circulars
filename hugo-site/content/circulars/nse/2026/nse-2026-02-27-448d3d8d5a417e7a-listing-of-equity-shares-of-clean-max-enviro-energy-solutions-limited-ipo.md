## Impact Assessment

The listing of Clean Max Enviro Energy Solutions Limited represents a significant new entrant in the renewable/clean energy sector on NSE. With an issue price of Rs. 1053 and over 117 million shares, the company's market capitalisation at listing is approximately Rs. 12,315 crore (~Rs. 1.23 lakh crore scale), making it a notable mid-to-large cap debut. The staggered lock-in structure across multiple tranches (with the longest lock-in extending to February 2029 for promoter/anchor portions) limits immediate supply and may support price stability in early trading. The inclusion in the pre-open IPO session allows price discovery before regular market hours on listing day. Market participants and members should update their systems to recognise the CLEANMAX symbol effective March 02, 2026.
