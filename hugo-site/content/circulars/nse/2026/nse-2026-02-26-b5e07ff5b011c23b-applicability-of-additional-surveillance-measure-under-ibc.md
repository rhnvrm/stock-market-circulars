## Summary

NSE has announced the applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) for companies under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) effective February 27, 2026. One new security — Eastern Silk Industries Limited (EASTSILK) — has been added to ASM Stage I. No securities have been moved between stages or excluded in this update. A consolidated list of 17+ securities under IBC-related ASM is provided, spanning Stage I and the 'Receipt of Corporate Announcement' category.

- No securities moved to or excluded from the 'Receipt of Corporate Announcement' category in this update
- Consolidated IBC-ASM list now contains at least 17 securities across Stage I and corporate announcement receipt categories

## Regulatory Changes

Under the ASM framework for IBC companies, NSE classifies securities into:
