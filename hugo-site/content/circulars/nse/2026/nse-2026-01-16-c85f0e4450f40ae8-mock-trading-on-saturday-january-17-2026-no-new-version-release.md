**Market Impact**: None - Mock trading does not result in any fund pay-in or pay-out obligations. No financial transactions will be processed.

**Technical Impact**: Minimal - No new version deployment reduces technical risk. Members can use existing connectivity parameters and infrastructure. The session tests both primary and disaster recovery site operations.

**Member Action Required**: Members should ensure participation to verify system readiness for Monday trading and confirm connectivity through live re-login process.
