## Regulatory Changes

ICICI Prudential Trust Limited approved the resumption of subscriptions in the affected schemes with specified investment limits per PAN. The AMC reserves the right to discontinue subscriptions if overseas investment limits are nearing the capped threshold.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investment limits apply only to fresh subscriptions and systematic registrations
- Limits are enforced at PAN level per scheme
- Members must ensure compliance with the specified investment caps for different SIP/STP frequencies
- Investors should periodically review and update KYC details including mobile number and email ID

- **Effective Date**: January 27, 2026 - Resumption of subscriptions with investment limits
- **Circular Date**: January 23, 2026
- **AMC Notice Date**: January 21, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The resumption allows retail investors to restart investments in these overseas-focused schemes while maintaining regulatory oversight through investment caps. The limits ensure controlled inflows to manage overseas investment allocation within regulatory caps. Existing SIP/STP investors continue unaffected, while new investors face monthly contribution limits. This measured approach balances investor access with fund management constraints related to overseas investment regulations.
