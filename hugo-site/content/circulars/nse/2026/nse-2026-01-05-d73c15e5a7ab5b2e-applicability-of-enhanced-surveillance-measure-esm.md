## Summary

NSE has issued updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework. Mahamaya Steel Industries Limited (MAHASTEEL) is moving from ESM Stage-I to Stage-II effective January 06, 2026. Securities under ESM will attract minimum 100% margin and shift from Rolling Settlement segment to Trade-for-Trade segment starting January 07, 2026. No new securities are being added to Stage-I, and no securities are being excluded from the ESM framework.

## Key Points

- No new securities added to ESM Stage-I
- MAHASTEEL (Mahamaya Steel Industries Limited, ISIN: INE451L01014) moves from Stage-I to Stage-II
- No securities moving from Stage-II to Stage-I
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework
- 100% margin requirement applies to all open positions as on January 06, 2026 and new positions from January 07, 2026
- Securities in ESM will shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM series) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST series)
- Stage-II securities will be under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- ESM framework works in conjunction with all other surveillance measures
- ESM shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements changes to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework as per previous circulars NSE/SURV/56948 (June 02, 2023), NSE/SURV/57609 (July 18, 2023), NSE/SURV/63361 (August 09, 2024), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), NSE/SURV/64400 (October 04, 2024), and NSE/SURV/69315 (July 25, 2025).

Securities qualifying under ESM will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment to Trade-for-Trade segment, with Stage-II securities additionally subject to Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure 100% margin coverage for all securities under ESM framework
- Margin requirement applies to both existing open positions (as on January 06, 2026) and new positions created from January 07, 2026
- Trading members must transition securities from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment
- For queries, members should contact NSE at surveillance@nse.co.in
- Refer to NSE FAQs on ESM at https://www.nseindia.com/regulations/enhanced-surveillance-measure-esm

## Important Dates

- **January 06, 2026**: MAHASTEEL moves to ESM Stage-II; Stage-II securities come under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- **January 07, 2026**: 100% margin requirement becomes effective on all open positions and new positions; securities shift from Rolling Settlement segment (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST)

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Affected Securities**: The shift to Trade-for-Trade segment with 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for traders and reduces liquidity in affected securities. MAHASTEEL traders will face stricter trading conditions with the move to Stage-II, including Periodic Call Auction mechanism with limited 2% price band.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to ensure adequate margin collection and adjust their risk management systems to accommodate the 100% margin requirement. The transition from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade will affect settlement procedures and intraday trading strategies.

**Market Surveillance Objective**: The measure aims to curb excessive volatility and speculative trading in securities exhibiting unusual price movements, protecting investor interests while maintaining market integrity.
