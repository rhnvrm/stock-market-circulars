- Total Rights Entitlements: 14,535,790
- Market lot size: 1
- Trading in Trade to Trade (T2T) segment, compulsory demat for all investors

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform all clients about the commencement of trading in REs, specifying the ISIN (INE075B20012) and clarifying that REs are not ordinary shares.
- Trading members must include a prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases, stating that:
  - Purchase of REs only gives the right to participate in the ongoing Rights Issue or renounce the REs before issue closes.
  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced on or before the Issue Closing Date shall lapse and be extinguished.

## Important Dates

- **February 26, 2026**: Trading in Rights Entitlements commences on NSE

- **March 6, 2026**: Date of suspension of trading in REs

## Impact Assessment

This circular primarily affects existing shareholders of Sical Logistics Limited who have been allotted Rights Entitlements. Shareholders have three options: subscribe to the rights issue by paying the application money, renounce (sell) their REs on the exchange during the trading window (February 26 – March 5, 2026), or allow the REs to lapse after the issue closing date. Trading in the T2T segment means each transaction results in mandatory delivery, reducing speculative activity. The overall market impact is limited and localized to Sical Logistics shareholders and interested investors.
