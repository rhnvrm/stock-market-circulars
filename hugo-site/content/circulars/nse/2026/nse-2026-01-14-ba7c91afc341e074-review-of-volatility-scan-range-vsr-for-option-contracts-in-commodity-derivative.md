title: Review of Volatility Scan Range (VSR) for Option Contracts in Commodity Derivatives
  Segment - February 2026
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has announced the updated Volatility Scan Range (VSR) parameters for option contracts in the Commodity Derivatives Segment, applicable for February 2026. The VSR ranges from 4% for Gold to 33% for Crude Oil across six commodity groups including their variants. This circular is part of the periodic review mechanism mandated by SEBI.

## Key Points

- VSR update applicable for February 2026 across six commodity categories
- Copper: 5% VSR
- Gold: 4% VSR (lowest)
- Silver: 6% VSR
- Zinc: 6% VSR
- Crude Oil: 33% VSR (highest)
- Natural Gas: 6% VSR
- Circular references SEBI guidelines SEBI/HO/CDMRD/DRMP/CIR/P/2021/08 dated January 11, 2021
- Continuation of previous circular 0392/2025 dated December 15, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

This represents a routine periodic review of VSR parameters as mandated by SEBI circular SEBI/HO/CDMRD/DRMP/CIR/P/2021/08. The VSR directly impacts the SPAN (Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk) margin calculation for commodity option contracts. The significant 33% VSR for Crude Oil reflects higher volatility expectations in energy markets compared to precious and base metals.

## Compliance Requirements

- All members trading commodity options must implement the updated VSR parameters
- Risk management systems must be updated to reflect the new VSR values for February 2026
- Margin calculations for commodity option positions will be based on these updated parameters
- Members should ensure their systems are configured correctly before February 2026 contracts become active

## Important Dates

- Circular Issue Date: January 14, 2026
- Effective Period: February 2026
- Reference to Previous Circular: December 15, 2025 (circular 0392/2025)

## Impact Assessment

The updated VSR parameters will directly affect margin requirements for traders holding option positions in commodity derivatives. The 33% VSR for Crude Oil indicates significantly higher margin requirements compared to other commodities, reflecting increased volatility and risk in energy markets. Gold maintains the lowest VSR at 4%, indicating relatively stable market conditions. Members and traders should adjust their risk management strategies and capital allocation accordingly, particularly for positions in Crude Oil which carries the highest volatility expectation.
