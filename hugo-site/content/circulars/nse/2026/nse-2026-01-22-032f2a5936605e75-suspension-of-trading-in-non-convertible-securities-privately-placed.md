The National Stock Exchange of India has announced the suspension of trading for four non-convertible securities (privately placed) effective January 23, 2026. The suspension is pursuant to Regulation 3.1.2 of the NSE Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A and applies to debt instruments issued by IDBI Bank Limited, SMFG India Home Finance Company Limited, Maithon Power Limited, and Tata Capital Limited. All suspensions are due to redemption of the securities.

## Key Points

- All suspensions are due to redemption of the securities
- Circular issued under NSE Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A, Regulation 3.1.2
- Circular Reference Number: 0120/2026

## Affected Securities

1. **IDBI Bank Limited** - ISIN: INE008A08V26
2. **SMFG India Home Finance Company Limited** - ISIN: INE213W07244
3. **Maithon Power Limited** - ISIN: INE082G07055
4. **Tata Capital Limited** - ISIN: INE306N08136

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements existing provisions under Regulation 3.1.2 of the National Stock Exchange Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A regarding suspension of securities upon redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must note that trading in the listed ISINs will be suspended from January 23, 2026
- No new trades can be executed in these securities post suspension date
- Settlement of existing trades (if any) should follow standard settlement procedures

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: January 22, 2026
- **Suspension Date**: January 23, 2026 (for all four securities)

## Impact Assessment

The suspension has limited market impact as it relates to scheduled redemption of privately placed debt securities. Investors holding these securities will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms of the respective instruments. This is a routine administrative action that follows the normal lifecycle of debt securities. Trading suspension prevents any inadvertent trades post-redemption and ensures orderly market operations. The impact is specific to holders of the four identified ISINs and does not affect broader market operations.
