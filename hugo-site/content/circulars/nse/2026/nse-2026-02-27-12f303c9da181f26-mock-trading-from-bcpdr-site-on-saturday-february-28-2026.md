The session runs from 09:00 to 17:00 hrs. No actual financial obligations arise from trades during this session. Members are required to re-login to the live environment post-session to ensure smooth connectivity for Monday, March 2, 2026.

- NOTIS application will be accessible during the mock session
- Trades carry no fund pay-in or pay-out obligations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational drill referencing existing circulars:
- NSE/MSD/67674 (April 24, 2025) and NSE/COM/71599 (December 2, 2025) for connectivity details
- NSE/MSD/71601 (December 2, 2025) for NEAT Adapter version guidance
- NSE/MSD/46441 and SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD1/DSAP/CIR/P/2020/234 for software testing requirements

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must use NEAT version 1.5.4 with the correct NEAT Adapter version and corresponding GR port
- Only UCC/PAN uploaded and approved before the cut-off will be permitted for order entry
- Members using NNF software must manually clear outstanding orders in their systems
- Members should participate using all trading software and re-login to the live environment after the session to confirm connectivity for March 2, 2026
- For UCC/PAN queries, contact: uci@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **February 28, 2026**: Mock trading session from DR site (09:00–17:00 hrs)
- **February 28, 2026, 18:30–19:00 hrs**: Live re-login window
- **March 2, 2026 (Monday)**: Next live trading day; smooth connectivity to be verified via re-login

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a standard BCP/DR drill confined to the Commodity Derivatives segment. No trades result in financial settlement. The primary operational requirement for members is to install the correct NEAT version, participate in the mock session, and complete the live re-login. Firms not participating risk connectivity issues on the subsequent live trading day (March 2, 2026).
