## Summary

NSE's Listing Department has notified all exchange members of a change in the ISIN code for Angel One Limited (Symbol: ANGELONE). The change is necessitated by a sub-division of the company's equity shares from a face value of Rs. 10/- per share to Re. 1/- per share. The new ISIN (INE732I01021) will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date of February 26, 2026.

- New ISIN: **INE732I01021**
- Reason: Sub-division of equity shares from face value Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/- per share.
- All trades on or after the ex-date (February 26, 2026) must use the new ISIN.
- Circular reference: NSE/CML/72914 | Circular Ref. No: 0305/2026.

## Regulatory Changes

The ISIN for Angel One Limited (ANGELONE) is being updated in NSE's systems to reflect the corporate action of share sub-division. The old ISIN will be replaced by INE732I01021 for all settlement and depository purposes from the ex-date.

## Compliance Requirements

- All exchange members must update their trading and back-office systems to use the new ISIN (INE732I01021) for Angel One Limited from February 26, 2026.
- Members must ensure that client holdings and pledges are updated with depositories using the new ISIN post the effective date.
- Any orders or transactions referencing the old ISIN after the ex-date may result in settlement issues.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 24, 2026
- **Ex-Date / Effective Date for New ISIN:** February 26, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This change has a moderate operational impact on members, brokers, and investors holding Angel One Limited shares. The share sub-division will increase the number of shares outstanding while proportionally reducing the face value, which typically affects liquidity positively. Investors and custodians must ensure their depository accounts reflect the updated ISIN to avoid any discrepancies in holdings, pledges, or settlement. Automated trading systems referencing ISIN codes will need to be updated before market open on February 26, 2026.
