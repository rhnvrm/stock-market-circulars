## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The face value split will make shares more affordable and may improve liquidity by reducing the trading price per share. The split does not change the company's market capitalization or shareholders' proportional ownership.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares for every 1 share held, with the price adjusting proportionally. Total investment value remains unchanged.

**Trading Impact**: Post-split, the stock will trade at approximately one-fifth of its pre-split price, potentially attracting more retail investors due to lower price per share.
