No. 0304/2026, Download Ref No: NSE/CML/72955) notifying the suspension of trading in privately placed Non-Convertible Securities of three companies effective February 24, 2026. The suspension is triggered by the upcoming redemption of these debt instruments, in accordance with Regulation 3.1.2 of the NSE Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A.

## Key Points

- Trading in three privately placed Non-Convertible Securities will be suspended from February 24, 2026
- All three suspensions are due to redemption of the respective instruments
- Regulation 3.1.2 of the NSE Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A governs this suspension
- Circular issued by Vishakha Kine, Manager, on behalf of NSE

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular is issued in routine pursuance of Regulation 3.1.2 of the National Stock Exchange Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A, which mandates notification of trading suspensions prior to redemption dates.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members are notified to cease trading in the listed securities from the suspension date
- Members must ensure no trades are executed in the affected ISINs on or after February 24, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 23, 2026
- **Suspension Effective Date:** February 24, 2026 (for all three securities)

| Sr. No. | Company Name | ISIN | Suspension Date | Reason |
|---------|-------------|------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | Torrent Power Limited | INE813H07184 | 24-Feb-2026 | Redemption |
| 2 | NHPC Limited | INE848E07153 | 24-Feb-2026 | Redemption |
| 3 | Muthoot Finance Limited | INE414G07HJ5 | 24-Feb-2026 | Redemption |

## Impact Assessment

The impact is routine and limited. Suspension of trading due to redemption is a standard lifecycle event for debt instruments. Investors holding these securities will receive redemption proceeds as scheduled. No adverse market impact is expected as redemptions are pre-announced events. The affected companies — Torrent Power (infrastructure/utilities), NHPC (hydropower PSU), and Muthoot Finance (NBFC) — are well-established entities, and this action pertains solely to specific debt instrument ISINs, not their equity shares.
