title: Revised Settlement Calendar for AKG Exim Limited Takeover Tender Offer
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued a revised settlement calendar for the Takeover offer under the Tender Offer scheme of AKG Exim Limited (Circular Ref. No: 0080/2026, Download Ref No: NCL/CMPT/72937). This revision supersedes the schedule communicated in the earlier circular NCL/CMPT/72514 dated January 29, 2026.

## Key Points

- Settlement Type X, Settlement No. 2026010 has been revised with updated obligation download and settlement dates.
- Trade period remains January 4, 2026 to February 17, 2026 (unchanged).
- Obligation Download date updated to **March 4, 2026**.
- Settlement Date updated to **March 5, 2026**.
- All other terms and conditions from circular NCL/CMPT/72514 dated January 29, 2026 continue to apply.
- Clearing Corporation may further revise the schedule in case of delays in receipt of acceptance details from RTA or delays in fund pay-in by the buying trading member.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This circular revises the operational settlement schedule previously notified under circular NCL/CMPT/72514 (Jan 29, 2026) and NSE/CMTR/72498 (Jan 28, 2026) for the AKG Exim Limited takeover tender offer.

## Compliance Requirements

- All Members, Custodians, and PCMs (Primary Clearing Members) are required to take note of the revised settlement schedule.
- Buying trading members must ensure timely fund pay-in to avoid further schedule revision.
- Parties should refer to NSE Clearing's helpdesk (Toll Free: 1800 266 00 50, Option 2; Email: ncl_tenderoffer@nsccl.co.in) for clarifications.

## Important Dates

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Trade Start Date | February 4, 2026 |
| Trade End Date | February 17, 2026 |
| Obligation Download | March 4, 2026 |
| Settlement Date | March 5, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

This revision has a **medium operational impact** limited to Members, Custodians, and PCMs participating in the AKG Exim Limited takeover offer. The updated settlement dates push obligations into early March 2026, requiring participants to plan fund availability and back-office processes accordingly. No broader market impact is anticipated as this is specific to a single company's tender offer settlement.
