It is issued in pursuance of circular no. 043/2025 (NCL/CMPT/67750) dated April 29, 2025, which governs the framework for computing MWPL and related limits.

## Compliance Requirements

- FII/FPI (Category I & II) and Mutual Funds must adhere to the respective stock-level limits as specified.

## Impact Assessment

The revision updates position ceilings for all participant categories trading ANGELONE in the F&O segment. Trading members, FIIs/FPIs, and mutual funds holding or planning positions in ANGELONE derivatives must review their existing positions against the new limits before market open on February 26, 2026. Breaching these limits could attract regulatory action from NSE Clearing Limited. The update is procedural in nature and reflects periodic recalibration of limits based on changes in free-float or share capital.
