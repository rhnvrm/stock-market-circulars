## Summary

NSE has notified the suspension of trading in privately placed non-convertible securities of two companies — Piramal Finance Limited and TVS Motor Company Limited — effective February 25, 2026. The suspension is pursuant to Regulation 3.1.2 of the National Stock Exchange Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A and is triggered by the redemption of these instruments.

## Key Points

- Trading in two privately placed non-convertible securities will be suspended from February 25, 2026
- Both suspensions are due to redemption of the respective instruments
- Piramal Finance Limited (ISIN: INE516Y07261) is suspended effective 25-Feb-2026
- TVS Motor Company Limited (ISIN: INE494B08036) is suspended effective 25-Feb-2026
- Circular issued under Regulation 3.1.2 of NSE Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular is an administrative notification under the existing framework of NSE Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A, Regulation 3.1.2, which governs suspension of trading in non-convertible securities upon occurrence of specified events such as redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members are notified to cease trading in the two specified ISINs from the effective suspension date
- Members must ensure no new trades are executed in INE516Y07261 and INE494B08036 on or after February 25, 2026

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 24, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Impact is limited and routine. Both suspensions are due to scheduled redemptions, meaning the instruments are reaching maturity. Holders of these securities will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms of the instrument. No broader market disruption is expected. This is a standard end-of-life action for debt instruments on the NSE debt market segment.
