## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market impact as it pertains to a standard sectoral mutual fund NFO launch. Members operating on the NSE MF Invest Platform need to operationally enable the six new ISINs for transaction processing. Investors interested in the banking and financial services sector can participate through Regular or Direct plans with Growth or IDCW options. No systemic or broad market implications are expected.
