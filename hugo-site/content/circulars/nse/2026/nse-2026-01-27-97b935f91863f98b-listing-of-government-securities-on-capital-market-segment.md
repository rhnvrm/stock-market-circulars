## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative circular with minimal market impact. The addition of two government securities expands the debt instrument universe available on NSE's capital market segment. The relatively attractive coupon rates (6.03% and 6.68%) may provide investment opportunities for debt market participants. There are no operational or compliance burdens on members beyond system updates to recognize the new securities. The circular does not affect equity trading or introduce new regulations.
