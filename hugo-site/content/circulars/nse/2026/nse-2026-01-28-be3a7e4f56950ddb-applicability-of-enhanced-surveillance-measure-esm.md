title: Applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM)
---

## Summary

NSE has issued Circular 65/2026 regarding Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) applicability. One security, Borana Weaves Limited (BORANA), has been shortlisted for inclusion under ESM Stage-I effective January 30, 2026. The security will attract a minimum 100% margin on all open and new positions and will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment to Trade-for-Trade segment. No securities are being moved between stages or excluded from the ESM framework in this update.

## Key Points

- Borana Weaves Limited (BORANA, ISIN: INE16SF01016) included in ESM Stage-I
- 100% margin requirement applicable on all open positions as of January 29, 2026
- 100% margin requirement on new positions created from January 30, 2026
- Security shifting from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM series) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST series)
- No securities moving from Stage-I to Stage-II or vice versa
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements NSE's Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework, continuing actions under previous circulars NSE/SURV/56948, NSE/SURV/57609, NSE/SURV/63361, NSE/SURV/64066, NSE/SURV/64400, and NSE/SURV/69315. Securities qualifying under ESM are subject to enhanced margin requirements and trading restrictions to address surveillance concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure 100% margin coverage for BORANA positions from January 30, 2026
- All trading in BORANA must be conducted in Trade-for-Trade segment (no intraday trading)
- Members must adjust their risk management systems to account for the enhanced margin requirements
- Positions existing as of January 29, 2026 will attract the 100% margin from January 30, 2026

## Important Dates

- **January 28, 2026**: Circular issue date
- **January 29, 2026**: Last day before ESM Stage-I implementation for BORANA; securities moving to Stage-II come under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- **January 30, 2026**: Effective date for 100% margin requirement on BORANA; shift to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST series) from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM series)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The inclusion of Borana Weaves Limited under ESM Stage-I significantly restricts trading flexibility by mandating Trade-for-Trade settlement, eliminating intraday trading opportunities. The 100% margin requirement substantially increases capital requirements for traders holding positions in this security.

**Liquidity Impact**: Trade-for-Trade segment placement typically reduces liquidity as it requires full upfront payment and delivery, discouraging speculative trading activity.

**Risk Management**: The enhanced surveillance measure serves as a market protection mechanism, indicating elevated surveillance concerns. Market participants should exercise increased caution when trading this security.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members must update their systems to reflect the segment change and margin requirements, and communicate these changes to clients holding or interested in trading BORANA.

Note: NSE clarifies that ESM shortlisting is purely a market surveillance action and should not be construed as adverse action against the company.
