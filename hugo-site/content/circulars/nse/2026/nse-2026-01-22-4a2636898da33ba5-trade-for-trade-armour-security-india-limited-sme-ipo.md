This follows the earlier circular NSE/CML/72428 dated January 21, 2026, and is in accordance with SEBI guidelines (CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012).

## Regulatory Changes

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: January 22, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 05, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Medium - The transfer to rolling segment will improve liquidity and ease of trading for ARMOUR shares. Trade-for-trade segment requires compulsory delivery and restricts intraday trading, while rolling segment allows normal trading with T+1 settlement. This is a positive development for investors and traders in the stock.

**Market Participants**: Brokers and traders can conduct normal intraday and delivery-based trades in ARMOUR from February 05, 2026, subject to standard margin requirements.
