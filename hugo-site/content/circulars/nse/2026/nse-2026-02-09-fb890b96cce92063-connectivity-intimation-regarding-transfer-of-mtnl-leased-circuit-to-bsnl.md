title: Connectivity - Intimation regarding Transfer of MTNL Leased Circuit to BSNL
---

## Summary

NSE has informed members that Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) leased circuit services have been taken over by Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL). Last mile connectivity services previously provided by MTNL under managed services of Telecom Network Integrator (TNI) Sify Technologies Limited will now be serviced and invoiced by BSNL. This change applies to all POPs under both "Managed" and "Self Service" mode leased lines wherever MTNL last mile services were available.

## Key Points

- MTNL leased circuit services transferred to BSNL effective immediately
- Change applies to all POPs under both Managed and Self Service mode leased lines where MTNL services were available
- Members can request TCP IP based requests (New Activation, Scenario Change, Bandwidth Change, Location shifting) through BSNL via ENIT online interface
- NSE will update telecom vendor details to "BSNL" for all existing active/pending MTNL links
- TNI (Sify Technologies Limited) continues to own and manage POPs as per circular NSE/MSD/61119 dated March 13, 2024
- Other connectivity procurement modalities remain unchanged as per circular NSE/MSD/67754 dated April 29, 2025
- Circular modifies section I C. of Exchange circular NSE/MSD/67754 dated April 29, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Partial modification to section I C. of Exchange circular NSE/MSD/67754 dated April 29, 2025 regarding telecom service provider for MTNL circuits. The regulatory framework for connectivity procurement remains unchanged, with only the service provider entity changing from MTNL to BSNL.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members using MTNL last mile connectivity must note that services will now be provided by BSNL
- For TCP IP based requests (New Activation, Scenario Change, Bandwidth Change, Location shifting), members should use BSNL as service provider via Exchange online interface ENIT at path: ENIT > Membership > TCP IP Scenario
- Members should expect invoicing from BSNL instead of MTNL going forward
- Members can refer to updated Sify escalation matrix (Annexure 1) for support:
  - NOC escalation for post-commissioning issues (Managed Services): 18004199963 / 044-61332900, email: nse.servicedesk@sifycorp.com
  - Onsite team escalation for new application requests: Contact details provided in annexure
  - Self Service mode members can use escalation matrix for new line configuration and link health at POP level

## Important Dates

- **February 09, 2026**: Circular issued
- **Immediate effect**: BSNL replaces MTNL as service provider for affected leased circuits

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Members currently using MTNL last mile connectivity services will experience a change in service provider and invoicing entity. While the transition is administrative in nature, members need to be aware of the new service provider for any future requests or issues.

**Member Impact**: Members with MTNL connectivity links will need to:
- Direct all future service requests to BSNL through ENIT interface
- Expect invoices from BSNL instead of MTNL
- Update internal records with new vendor information

**Service Continuity**: No disruption expected as this is a transfer of ownership rather than a service discontinuation. TNI (Sify) continues to manage POPs and provide escalation support as before.

**Financial Impact**: No change in connectivity procurement processes or costs indicated. Members will be invoiced by BSNL instead of MTNL for the same services.
