## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited (NCL) has issued Circular Ref. No. 004/2026 (Download Ref No: NCL/DS/72929) on February 20, 2026, providing the revised list of approved securities and empaneled banks for the Debt Segment. This supersedes circular 003/2026 (NCL/DS/72435) dated January 21, 2026. The revised lists are effective for the month of **March 2026**.

## Key Points

- **Annexure 1**: Updated list of GOI Securities (G-Sec) / T-Bills and Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) accepted as cash component of liquid assets, along with applicable haircut rates. All SGB/G-Sec/T-Bills issued by RBI during the month are accepted from the date of issue.
- **Annexure 2**: Updated list of Corporate Bonds accepted as non-cash component of liquid assets, with market-wide applicable limits and haircut rates.
- **Annexure 3**: Updated list of banks empaneled for issuance of Bank Guarantees (BGs) and Fixed Deposit Receipts (FDRs).
- All listed Sovereign Gold Bonds carry a uniform **haircut rate of 10%** (0.10).
- G-Sec/T-Bills have a **shut period of two days**; members must release these instruments at least two days before maturity.
- Member-banks must ensure that G-Sec provided as collateral are **not reckoned for SLR purposes** and are not used for trading.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework is introduced. This is a periodic revision to the approved collateral list in line with ongoing debt segment operations. The update reflects changes in eligible securities and empaneled bank details for March 2026.

## Compliance Requirements

- All Members, Custodians, and PCMs (Primary Clearing Members) in the Debt Segment must update their collateral management systems to reflect the revised Annexure 1, 2, and 3 lists effective March 2026.
- Members holding G-Sec/T-Bills as collateral must plan releases at least **two business days before maturity** to respect the shut period.
- Members who are also banks must segregate G-Sec pledged as collateral and ensure these are excluded from SLR calculations and are not traded.
- Contact for queries: collaterals_ops@nsccl.co.in | IVR: 1800 266 0050 (option 2).

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: February 20, 2026
- **Effective Period**: March 2026
- **Supersedes**: Circular 003/2026 dated January 21, 2026 (NCL/DS/72435)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine monthly operational update with medium operational impact for Debt Segment participants. Members must review the updated annexures to ensure their collateral portfolio remains compliant. The consistent 10% haircut on all Sovereign Gold Bonds and the two-day shut period rule for G-Sec/T-Bills are unchanged. Failure to comply with the revised approved list could result in collateral shortfalls or margin obligations not being met. No broad market or price impact is expected.
