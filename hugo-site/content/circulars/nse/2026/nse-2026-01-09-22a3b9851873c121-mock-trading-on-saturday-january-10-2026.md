The Unique Client Code (UCC) live environment will be unavailable from 10 AM until midnight on January 10, 2026.

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must avoid adding or modifying UCC records between 10 AM and midnight on Saturday, January 10, 2026
- Members should plan UCC updates before 10 AM on January 10, 2026, or after midnight to ensure validity for live trading sessions
- Members must ensure all necessary UCC records are updated before the blackout period to avoid disruption in live trading from January 12, 2026

- **January 10, 2026**: Mock trading session; UCC system unavailable from 10 AM to midnight
- **January 10, 2026**: End of day - UCC records added/modified during blackout period will be purged
- **January 12, 2026**: Live trading resumes (Monday)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Members must plan their UCC management activities around the blackout period. Failure to comply may result in invalid client codes and inability to trade for affected clients when live trading resumes on January 12, 2026.

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine mock trading exercise with no impact on live markets. However, members must coordinate internally to ensure no critical UCC updates are scheduled during the blackout window.

**Member Action Required**: Members should communicate this blackout period to relevant teams handling client onboarding and UCC management to prevent operational issues.
