## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**

- Higher capital requirements for positions in these stocks, both in cash and F&O segments
- Potential liquidity impact as traders may reduce exposure due to higher margin costs

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members must update margin files and risk management systems by January 7, 2026
- Clients holding positions in newly added securities will face margin calls
- Brokers need to communicate changes to affected clients before effective date

**Risk Management:**
- Framework aims to mitigate risks associated with high promoter shareholding encumbrance
- Protects market integrity by ensuring adequate margins in securities with elevated risk profiles
- Part of NSE's ongoing surveillance to prevent market manipulation and protect investors

**Note:** NSE clarifies that inclusion in this framework is purely for market surveillance purposes and should not be construed as adverse action against the companies.
