  to Rs. 2
---

## Summary

NSE has announced that Silver Touch Technologies Limited (Symbol: SILVERTUC) will undergo a face value split of its equity shares. The face value and paid-up value per share will be reduced from Rs. 10 to Rs. 2, effective March 06, 2026.

## Key Points

- Silver Touch Technologies Limited (SILVERTUC) equity shares will undergo a face value split
- Existing face value and paid-up value: Rs. 10 per share
- New face value and paid-up value: Rs. 2 per share
- Split ratio: 5:1 (each Rs. 10 share becomes five Rs. 2 shares)
- Circular issued by NSE Listing Department under Download Ref No: NSE/CML/72947

## Regulatory Changes

The face value and paid-up value of equity shares of Silver Touch Technologies Limited will be formally changed in NSE records with effect from March 06, 2026. This change is mandated under NSE Circular Ref. No: 0297/2026.

## Compliance Requirements

- All members of NSE are informed and must take note of the revised face value effective March 06, 2026
- Trading systems and back-office records should be updated to reflect the new face value of Rs. 2 per share for SILVERTUC

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 23, 2026
- **Effective Date:** March 06, 2026 (date from which new face value of Rs. 2 is applicable)

## Impact Assessment

The face value split from Rs. 10 to Rs. 2 represents a 5:1 split ratio. This typically increases share affordability and liquidity by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by 5 while proportionally reducing the price per share. Market capitalization remains unchanged. Existing shareholders will hold five times the number of shares at one-fifth the face value. Members and market participants must update their systems accordingly before the effective date of March 06, 2026.
