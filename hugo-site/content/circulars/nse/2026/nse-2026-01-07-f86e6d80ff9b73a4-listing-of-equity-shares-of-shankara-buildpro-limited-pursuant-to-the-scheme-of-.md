## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - New listing creates a separate tradable entity for the demerged trading business. Initial placement in Trade for Trade segment limits liquidity and speculative activity until migration to regular EQ segment.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders of Shankara Building Products Limited receive equivalent shares in the new entity (1:1 ratio), maintaining their proportionate ownership in the demerged business without dilution.

**Operational Impact**: The demerger separates the trading business into an independent listed entity, allowing focused operations and potentially better valuation discovery for both entities.
