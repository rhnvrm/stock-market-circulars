## Impact Assessment

This is a routine NFO launch notification with limited market-wide impact. It provides members an opportunity to facilitate client investments in a banking-sector ETF tracking the BSE Top 10 Banks index. The short subscription window (6 days) and sector-specific focus limit the broader market impact. Members dealing in mutual fund transactions should update their platforms accordingly to accept subscriptions.
