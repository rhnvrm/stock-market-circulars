The suspension is pursuant to Regulation 3.1.2 of the NSE Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A. All five securities are being suspended due to redemption activities, including two cases where issuers are exercising call options.

- Three securities are suspended due to regular redemption
- Two securities are suspended due to redemption for exercising call option
- Action taken under Regulation 3.1.2 of NSE Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Exchange members must cease trading in the specified ISINs from January 14, 2026
- Members should update their trading systems to reflect the suspension status
- Bondholders of affected securities should coordinate with issuers for redemption procedures

## Important Dates

- **Suspension Effective Date**: January 14, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The suspension affects bondholders and traders in five debt securities across banking, financial services, and development finance sectors. Impact is limited and procedural, as suspensions are due to scheduled redemptions. Bondholders will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms of their securities. No broader market implications expected as these are privately placed securities with limited secondary market trading activity.
