## Summary

NSE has issued a circular regarding the applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) effective January 14, 2026. The exchange will impose enhanced surveillance measures including increased margin requirements on select securities that meet specific surveillance criteria. The margin rate will be 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at 100%, applicable to all open positions as of January 14, 2026 and new positions from January 16, 2026.

## Key Points

- Ausom Enterprise Limited (AUSOMENT) added to ST-ASM Stage I effective January 14, 2026
- Vivimed Labs Limited (VIVIMEDLAB) moved from ST-ASM Stage I to Stage II
- Three securities excluded from ASM framework: K2 Infragen Limited, Sheetal Cool Products Limited, and Shivalic Power Control Limited
- Margin requirement set at 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), maximum capped at 100%
- ASM framework works in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not adverse action against companies

- **Margin Requirements**: Applicable rate of margin shall be 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher, subject to maximum rate capped at 100%
- **Application Scope**: Applies to all open positions as on January 14, 2026 and new positions created from January 16, 2026

## Important Dates

- **January 14, 2026**: Effective date for securities shortlisted under ST-ASM framework
- **January 16, 2026**: Enhanced margin requirements become applicable on all open positions and new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:**
- Increased capital requirements for trading in affected securities due to 50% minimum margin
- Higher margin requirements may reduce trading volumes and liquidity in affected stocks
- Existing position holders must maintain enhanced margins from January 16, 2026

**Market Impact:**
- Enhanced surveillance aims to curb excessive speculation and volatility
- May lead to temporary price corrections in affected securities
- Stage movement (e.g., VIVIMEDLAB to Stage II) indicates escalating surveillance concerns

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers need to update margin collection systems before January 16, 2026
- Risk management systems require reconfiguration for affected securities
- Client communication and education about enhanced requirements necessary

**Risk Management:**
- Framework designed to protect market integrity through preventive surveillance
- Exclusion of three securities (K2INFRA, SCPL, SPCL) indicates improved compliance or risk profile
- Consolidated ASM list maintains ongoing surveillance on multiple securities across stages
