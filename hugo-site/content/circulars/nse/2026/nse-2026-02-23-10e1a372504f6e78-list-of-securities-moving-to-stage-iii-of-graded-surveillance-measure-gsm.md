## Summary

NSE's Surveillance Department has issued Circular Ref. No. 137/2026 (Download Ref: NSE/SURV/72938) dated February 23, 2026, notifying that **Blue Chip India Limited** (Symbol: `BLUECHIP`, ISIN: `INE657B01025`) will be moved to **Stage III of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM)** effective February 24, 2026. This escalation imposes significant trading restrictions on the security, including mandatory trade-to-trade settlement, weekly trading frequency, and a 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) requirement for buyers.

## Key Points

- Trading will be permitted **only once a week** — every Monday, or the first trading day of the week.
- **Price band** is restricted to **5% or lower** as applicable.
- **Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD)** of **100% of the trade value** must be deposited by buyers.
- Settlement shall be done on a **trade-to-trade basis** — no netting off is allowed.

## Regulatory Changes

This circular continues a series of GSM-related circulars (NSE/SURV/34262, NSE/SURV/38389, NSE/SURV/42790, NSE/SURV/59425, NSE/SURV/64066, and NSE/SURV/71670) spanning February 2017 to December 2025. The escalation to Stage III from a lower GSM stage represents an increase in surveillance stringency. Stage III requirements include:

- Trade for Trade (T2T) settlement with a 5% or lower price band
- Trading permitted only once a week (Every Monday / 1st trading day of the week)
- ASD of 100% of trade value to be deposited by buyers

For reference, Stage IV adds a further restriction of no upward price movement, while Stages I and II carry lighter restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- **NSE Members** must ensure all trades in BLUECHIP are settled on a trade-to-trade basis with no netting off.
- **Buyers** must deposit an ASD equal to **100% of the trade value** before executing trades.
- Members must restrict trading in BLUECHIP to **once per week** (Mondays or first trading day).
- Members should refer to the GSM FAQs on the NSE website for detailed framework guidance.
- Queries may be directed to: **surveillance@nse.co.in**

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 23, 2026
- **Effective Date of Stage III GSM:** February 24, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The move to Stage III GSM severely restricts trading activity in Blue Chip India Limited. With weekly trading limits, a 100% ASD obligation, and mandatory T2T settlement, liquidity in this security will be substantially reduced. Investors holding or wishing to trade this stock will face significant operational constraints. The 5% price band further limits intraday price movement. This action signals heightened regulatory concern about the stock's trading patterns or fundamentals, and market participants should exercise extreme caution.
