## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Low - This is a routine mock trading session with no financial obligations. No actual trades will result in fund pay-in or pay-out.

**System Impact**: Members need to prepare for testing on Saturday with limited Extranet/member portal availability from 12:00 pm onwards. NOTIS application will have limited functionality (only trade download accessible).

**Member Impact**: Members can use this session for software testing and regulatory compliance requirements. No new version deployment reduces complexity and risk.

**Market Impact**: None - Mock session only, no impact on live trading operations or settlement processes.
