## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

The transaction holiday specifically affects the Securities Lending & Borrowing Scheme segment. Participants and custodians will be unable to execute SLBS transactions on January 15, 2026. This is a localized impact related to Maharashtra state elections and affects only SLBS operations while other market segments may operate differently as per their respective circulars. Market participants should adjust their securities lending and borrowing strategies to account for this one-day closure.
