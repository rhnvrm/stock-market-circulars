## Summary

NSE has issued Circular No. 14/2026 implementing Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) on three securities under the Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I. The affected securities will be subject to 100% margin requirements on all open and new positions effective January 9, 2026. This action is part of NSE's ongoing market surveillance framework and should not be construed as adverse action against the companies.

## Key Points

- Three securities included in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I effective January 7, 2026
- 100% margin requirement applicable on all open positions as on January 8, 2026
- 100% margin requirement on all new positions created from January 9, 2026 onwards
- No securities moved to Stage-IV or Trade-for-Trade segment in this circular
- No securities progressed between ASM stages (I to II, II to III, or I to IV)
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance purposes

## Securities Affected

**Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I (w.e.f. January 7, 2026):**

1. **Goyal Aluminiums Limited** (Symbol: GOYALALUM, ISIN: INE705X01026)
2. **Lokesh Machines Limited** (Symbol: LOKESHMACH, ISIN: INE397H01017)
3. **S&S Power Switchgears Limited** (Symbol: S&SPOWER, ISIN: INE902B01017)

## Regulatory Changes

This circular reinforces the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework previously established through circulars dated October 27, 2018, July 22, 2020, December 04, 2020, June 04, 2021, April 22, 2022, August 09, 2024, and September 20, 2024. The applicable surveillance action is a 100% margin requirement for the three identified securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- **January 8, 2026**: Last day before margin requirements take effect
- **January 9, 2026**: 100% margin requirement becomes effective on all open and new positions

## Impact Assessment

- Risk management systems need to be adjusted for these securities

**Investor Impact:**
- High - Investors cannot use leverage for trading these securities
- Existing leveraged positions must be fully funded or squared off
- Increased capital requirements for maintaining positions
