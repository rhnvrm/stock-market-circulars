title: Revised List of Approved Securities and Banks for Non-Cash Liquid Assets (F&O
  Segment)
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a revised list of equity shares eligible as the non-cash component of liquid assets for the Futures & Options (F&O) segment. The circular specifies 39 large-cap securities (Annexure 1), their ISINs, overall permitted quantities across all segments, and member-wise permitted quantities. The applicable haircut for all listed securities is the Value at Risk (VAR) based haircut.

## Key Points

- A total of 39 equity shares are approved as non-cash liquid assets for the F&O segment.
- Applicable haircut for all listed securities is VAR (Value at Risk) based.
- Value-based prudential norm: exclusion of a pledged security must not result in a margin shortfall of more than 25% at the Clearing Member level.
- Member-wise permitted quantity for the F&O segment is listed as "N.A" for all securities, meaning no individual member-level cap is specified.
- The list includes all major Nifty 50 constituents and blue-chip stocks.

## Regulatory Changes

This circular represents a revised/updated version of the approved securities list. The inclusion of **ETERNAL LIMITED** (INE758T01015) with a large permitted quantity of 1,822,429,145 units is notable and may reflect a recent addition or renaming. All other securities are well-established large-cap stocks previously on the approved list.

## Compliance Requirements

- Clearing Members must ensure that pledged securities used as non-cash collateral are drawn from this approved list.
- Clearing Members must monitor that the exclusion of any single pledged security does not cause a margin shortfall exceeding 25% at the Clearing Member level.
- Members should update their internal collateral management systems to reflect the revised permitted quantities per this circular.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** 2026-02-20 (date of circular issuance). Members should treat this as the operative list from the date of publication.

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine but operationally important update for clearing members and institutional participants in the F&O segment. The 39 approved securities represent India's most liquid large-cap stocks, ensuring systemic robustness in margin collateral. Clearing members holding or accepting pledges of any of the listed securities as non-cash margin must verify their internal permitted quantity limits align with this revised circular. The 25% prudential norm on margin shortfall from a single excluded security is a risk-control measure that directly affects collateral portfolio construction for large clearing members.
