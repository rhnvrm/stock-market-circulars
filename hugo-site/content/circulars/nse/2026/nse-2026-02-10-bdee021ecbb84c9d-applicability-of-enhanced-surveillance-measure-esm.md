title: Applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Loyal Textile Mills
  Added to Stage I
---

## Summary

NSE has issued circular 105/2026 regarding the applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM). Loyal Textile Mills Limited (LOYALTEX, ISIN: INE970D01010) has been added to ESM Stage I effective February 11, 2026. The security will attract a minimum 100% margin requirement and will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (EQ/SM series) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST series) from February 12, 2026. No securities are being moved between stages or excluded from the ESM framework in this update.

## Key Points

- One security added to ESM Stage I: Loyal Textile Mills Limited (LOYALTEX)
- 100% minimum margin applicable on all open positions as on February 11, 2026 and new positions from February 12, 2026
- Security will shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST) effective February 12, 2026
- No securities moving from Stage I to Stage II or vice versa
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework
- Consolidated ESM list includes multiple securities across Stage I and Stage II (partial list showing CURAA, DHARIWAL, DPEL in Stage II)
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework continues to be applied based on predefined market surveillance criteria. Securities qualifying under ESM are subject to:

- Mandatory shift from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade settlement mechanism
- Enhanced margin requirements of minimum 100%
- Securities moving to Stage II are additionally placed under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction

This action is purely on account of market surveillance and should not be construed as adverse action against the concerned company.

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must ensure 100% margin collection on LOYALTEX for all open positions as on February 11, 2026
- 100% margin must be collected on all new positions in LOYALTEX created from February 12, 2026 onwards
- Trading members must adapt to Trade-for-Trade settlement mechanism for the affected security from February 12, 2026
- Market participants must comply with all other prevailing surveillance measures in conjunction with ESM
- For queries, members may contact NSE at surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **February 10, 2026**: Circular issue date
- **February 11, 2026**: ESM Stage I applicability date; 100% margin applies to existing open positions
- **February 12, 2026**: Security shifts from EQ/SM to BE/ST series; 100% margin applies to all new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The inclusion of Loyal Textile Mills Limited in ESM Stage I will significantly impact its trading dynamics. The 100% margin requirement substantially increases capital costs for traders and investors holding positions in this security.

**Liquidity Impact**: The shift to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST series) eliminates the possibility of netting positions and requires delivery-based settlement for all transactions, which typically reduces liquidity and trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: Existing position holders must arrange for 100% margin by February 11, 2026. The trade-for-trade mechanism from February 12, 2026 means investors cannot engage in intraday trading and must take/give delivery of shares.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to update their risk management systems to ensure mandatory 100% margin collection and adjust settlement processes for trade-for-trade mechanism. The surveillance measure aims to curb excessive speculation and ensure price stability in the affected security.
