  Shareholding Pattern Requirements
---

## Summary

NSE has announced the suspension of trading in securities of four companies - Debock Industries Limited (DIL), Future Consumer Limited (FCONSUMER), Rajesh Exports Limited (RAJESHEXPO), and Shree Ram Proteins Limited (SRPL) - effective February 12, 2026. The suspension is due to non-compliance with Regulation 31 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, specifically the failure to submit shareholding patterns for two consecutive quarters ending June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025. This action is taken pursuant to SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024.

## Key Points

- Four companies face trading suspension for non-submission of shareholding pattern for Q2 and Q3 FY2025-26
- Suspension effective from February 12, 2026
- Companies have until February 09, 2026 to comply and avoid suspension
- After 15 days of suspension, trading will be allowed on Trade for Trade basis (Z category) on first trading day of every week for six months
- Non-compliance pertains to Regulation 31 of SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular enforces existing provisions of SEBI Master Circular dated November 11, 2024 and Regulation 31 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 regarding mandatory submission of shareholding patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Affected Companies:**
- Must submit pending shareholding patterns for June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025 quarters
- Compliance deadline: On or before February 09, 2026 to avoid suspension
- Failure to comply will result in complete trading suspension from February 12, 2026

**Post-Suspension Trading Restrictions:**
- If suspension occurs, it continues until full compliance with Master Circular
- After 15 days of suspension, trading shifts to Trade for Trade basis (Z category)
- Restricted trading allowed only on first trading day of each week for six months

## Important Dates

- **January 12, 2026**: Circular issued
- **February 09, 2026**: Final deadline for companies to comply and avoid suspension
- **February 12, 2026**: Trading suspension effective date
- **February 27, 2026** (approximately): After 15 days of suspension, Trade for Trade basis trading begins (if non-compliance continues)

**Affected Quarters:**
- Q2 FY2025-26: June 30, 2025
- Q3 FY2025-26: September 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Complete halt in trading of four company securities affects investor liquidity
- Investors holding these securities will be unable to exit positions during suspension period
- Potential price impact when trading resumes due to pent-up sell pressure

**Investor Impact:**
- High impact on shareholders of DIL, FCONSUMER, RAJESHEXPO, and SRPL
- Loss of liquidity and inability to trade for potentially extended period
- If moved to Z category, extremely limited trading opportunities (once per week only)

**Company Impact:**
- Reputational damage from regulatory non-compliance
- Reduced market capitalization and investor confidence
- Difficulty in raising capital or conducting corporate actions during suspension
- Trade for Trade basis increases transaction costs and reduces liquidity further

**Severity Assessment:**
This is a high-severity action affecting four listed companies. The progression from complete suspension to restricted weekly trading demonstrates escalating regulatory enforcement. Rajesh Exports Limited (RAJESHEXPO) is particularly notable as it is a larger, more prominent company in the gems and jewelry sector, making this suspension significant for that industry segment.
