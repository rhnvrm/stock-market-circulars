title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Addition of Securities to Stage I
---

## Summary

NSE has announced the inclusion of two securities under Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Stage I effective January 29, 2026. The affected securities—Ascom Leasing & Investments Limited and Excellent Wires and Packaging Limited—will be subject to a minimum 100% margin requirement and shifted from rolling settlement to trade-for-trade segment. This surveillance action is taken to safeguard market integrity and does not constitute adverse action against the companies.

## Key Points

- Two securities added to ESM Stage I: ASCOM (Ascom Leasing & Investments Limited) and EXCELLENT (Excellent Wires and Packaging Limited)
- 100% minimum margin applicable on all open positions as on January 28, 2026, and new positions from January 29, 2026
- Securities shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST)
- No securities moving from Stage I to Stage II or vice versa
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Action is purely surveillance-based and not an adverse action against the companies

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework continues to be applied based on predefined criteria. Securities qualifying under ESM are subject to:

1. **Margin Requirements**: Minimum 100% margin on all positions
2. **Settlement Changes**: Shift from rolling settlement to trade-for-trade settlement
3. **Series Migration**: Movement from EQ/SM series to BE/ST series
4. **Stage II Provisions**: Securities moving to Stage II will be under trade-for-trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction (though no securities moved to Stage II in this circular)

This measure references previous circulars: NSE/SURV/56948 (June 02, 2023), NSE/SURV/57609 (July 18, 2023), NSE/SURV/63361 (August 09, 2024), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), NSE/SURV/64400 (October 04, 2024), and NSE/SURV/69315 (July 25, 2025).

## Important Dates

- **January 27, 2026**: Circular issued (Circular Ref. No: 63/2026)
- **January 28, 2026**: 100% margin applicable on all open positions in ASCOM and EXCELLENT

  - 100% margin applicable on new positions
  - Securities shifted from EQ/SM to BE/ST series (trade-for-trade settlement begins)
  - EXCELLENT specifically noted for EQ/SM to BE/ST transition

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- **Liquidity Reduction**: Trade-for-trade settlement significantly reduces liquidity as intraday trading is eliminated
- **Trading Volume**: Expected decline in trading volumes for affected securities due to delivery-only requirement
- **Price Discovery**: May experience reduced price efficiency due to lower liquidity

**Operational Impact:**
- **Margin Requirements**: 100% margin requirement substantially increases capital requirements for traders
- **Position Management**: Existing position holders must arrange additional margins or square off positions
- **Settlement Changes**: Shift to compulsory delivery settlement affects trading strategies

**Investor Impact:**
- Short-term traders and speculators will be discouraged from trading these securities
- Only delivery-based investors can participate, limiting market participation
- Increased capital lock-in due to full upfront margin requirement

**Risk Mitigation:**
- The ESM framework aims to protect investor interests by curbing excessive speculation
- Enhanced margins reduce leverage-related risks in securities showing concerning trading patterns
- The measure is surveillance-based and not a reflection on company fundamentals

**Scope:**
The consolidated ESM list includes multiple securities across Stage I and Stage II, with this circular adding 2 securities to Stage I. The framework remains dynamic with regular reviews for inclusion and exclusion based on surveillance criteria.
