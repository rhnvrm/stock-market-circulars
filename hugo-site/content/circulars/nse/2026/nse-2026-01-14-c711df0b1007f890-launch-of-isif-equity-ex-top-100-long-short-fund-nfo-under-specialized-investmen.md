## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to a new mutual fund offering under the Specialized Investment Fund category. The impact is limited to:

- **Investors**: Provides a new investment opportunity in equity long-short strategy focusing on stocks outside the top 100
- **NSE Members**: Routine operational requirement to facilitate NFO subscriptions through the NSE MF Invest Platform
- **Market Operations**: Standard NFO launch with no changes to existing trading or settlement procedures

The fund's specialized nature (long-short strategy on Ex-Top 100 stocks) targets sophisticated investors but does not affect broader market operations or compliance frameworks.
