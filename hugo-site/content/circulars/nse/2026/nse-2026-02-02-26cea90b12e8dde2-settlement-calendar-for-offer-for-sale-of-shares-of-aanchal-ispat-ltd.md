## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - This circular affects members, custodians, and Portfolio Custodial Managers (PCMs) participating in the Aanchal Ispat Ltd. OFS. The staggered settlement schedule across multiple days requires careful operational coordination.

**Market Impact:** Medium - The OFS provides liquidity for Aanchal Ispat shares with separate retail and institutional windows. The differentiated margin requirements (0% and 100%) for non-retail participants may influence bidding strategies.

**Compliance Impact:** The standard T+1 settlement cycle applies with specific custodial confirmation requirements for institutional participants. Failure to meet confirmation deadlines or pay-in timings could result in settlement failures.
