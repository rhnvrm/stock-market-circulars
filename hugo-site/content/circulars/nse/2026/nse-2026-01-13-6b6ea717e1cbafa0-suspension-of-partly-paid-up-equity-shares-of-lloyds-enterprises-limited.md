---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has issued a circular suspending trading of partly paid-up equity shares of Lloyds Enterprises Limited (Symbol: LLOYDPP, ISIN: IN9080I01015) effective from January 16, 2026. The suspension is being implemented on account of first and final call money, pursuant to Regulation 3.1.2 of the NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies specifically to partly paid-up equity shares of Lloyds Enterprises Limited
- Symbol: LLOYDPP
- ISIN: IN9080I01015
- Suspension reason: First and final call money
- Regulatory authority: NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A, Regulation 3.1.2

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes introduced. This is an operational trading suspension measure for a specific security based on existing regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members and market participants must cease trading in LLOYDPP shares from the effective date
- Shareholders of partly paid-up shares must respond to the call money notice as per company requirements
- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the suspended status of this security

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: January 13, 2026
- **Last Trading Day**: January 14, 2026 (closing hours)
- **Suspension Effective Date**: January 16, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High for holders of LLOYDPP partly paid-up shares as they will be unable to trade these securities until the suspension is lifted. This suspension relates to the company's call money process, where shareholders with partly paid-up shares are required to pay the remaining amount.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems reflect the suspension status. Shareholders holding these partly paid-up shares need to respond to the company's call money requirement to convert them to fully paid-up shares, which would then be eligible for normal trading under the regular symbol.
