The face value and paid-up value of equity shares will be reduced from Rs. 10 to Rs. 5 per share, effective March 02, 2026. This is a standard corporate action that will proportionally increase the number of shares in circulation while keeping total market capitalization unchanged.

- Existing face value and paid-up value: Rs. 10 per share
- New face value and paid-up value: Rs. 5 per share
- Split ratio: 2-for-1 (each Rs. 10 share becomes two Rs. 5 shares)
- Effective date: March 02, 2026
- Circular issued by NSE Department of Listing (Ref: NSE/CML/72934, Circular 0296/2026)

## Regulatory Changes
