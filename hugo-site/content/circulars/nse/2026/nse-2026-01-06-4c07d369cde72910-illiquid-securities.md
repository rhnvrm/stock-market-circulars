## Summary

NSE has issued an update on illiquid securities subject to periodic call auction mechanism effective January 09, 2026. The circular is issued in continuance of Exchange circular NSE/CMTR/25320 dated December 20, 2013, and pursuant to SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/38/2013 dated December 19, 2013. The list is based on trading activity during July 2025 - December 2025. No securities are being added to or removed from the periodic call auction mechanism.

## Key Points

- Effective date: January 09, 2026 (Friday)
- Review period: July 2025 - December 2025
- Annexure 1 (securities moving into periodic call auction): Nil
- Annexure 2 (securities moving out of periodic call auction): Nil
- Members advised to exercise additional due diligence while trading in illiquid securities
- Trading applies to both proprietary and client accounts

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular continues the existing framework established by:
- NSE circular NSE/CMTR/25320 dated December 20, 2013
- SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/38/2013 dated December 19, 2013 on rationalization of periodic call auction for illiquid scrips

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must exercise additional due diligence while trading in illiquid securities
- This applies to trading on own account or on behalf of clients
- For queries, members should contact surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: January 06, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 09, 2026 (Friday)
- **Review Period**: July 2025 - December 2025

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as no securities are being added to or removed from the periodic call auction mechanism. This is a routine update confirming the status quo. The periodic call auction framework continues to apply to existing illiquid securities to ensure fair price discovery and investor protection in low-liquidity securities.
