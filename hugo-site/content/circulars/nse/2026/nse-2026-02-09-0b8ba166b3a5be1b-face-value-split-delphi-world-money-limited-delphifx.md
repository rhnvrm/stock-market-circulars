## Summary

National Stock Exchange of India has announced a face value split for Delphi World Money Limited (DELPHIFX). The face value and paid-up value of equity shares will be subdivided from Rs. 10 per share to Rs. 2 per share, representing a 1:5 split ratio. This change will be effective from February 13, 2026.

## Key Points

- Company: Delphi World Money Limited
- Stock Symbol: DELPHIFX
- Existing face value: Rs. 10 per share
- New face value: Rs. 2 per share
- Split ratio: 1:5 (each existing share will become 5 shares)
- Effective date: February 13, 2026
- Circular reference: NSE/CML/72694, Circular No. 0202/2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action initiated by the company and approved through proper channels. The split follows standard procedures for face value subdivision of equity shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note the change in face value for trading and settlement purposes
- Existing shareholders will automatically receive shares in the new denomination in the ratio of 5:1
- All trading systems and records must reflect the new face value from the effective date
- Brokers and trading members should update their systems accordingly

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date:** February 09, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 13, 2026 - New face value comes into effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The face value split will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the price per share proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors due to lower absolute price per share. Existing shareholders' total investment value remains unchanged.

**Operational Impact:** Trading systems, settlement mechanisms, and shareholder records will need to reflect the new share structure. The split does not affect the company's market capitalization or shareholders' proportional ownership.
