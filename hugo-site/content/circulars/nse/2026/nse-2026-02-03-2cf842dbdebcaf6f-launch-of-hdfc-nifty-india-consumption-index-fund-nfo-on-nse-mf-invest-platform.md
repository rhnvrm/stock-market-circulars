## Impact Assessment

This is a routine NFO launch with minimal market impact. The circular is informational in nature, notifying NSE members about the availability of a new index fund tracking the Nifty India Consumption Index. The launch expands product offerings on the NSE MF Invest Platform but does not affect existing securities, trading operations, or compliance frameworks. Impact is limited to members who choose to facilitate client investments in this specific NFO.
