## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and traders of these specific privately placed non-convertible securities. This is a routine administrative action following the normal lifecycle of debt instruments. The suspension affects only the debt market segment and does not impact equity trading of LIC Housing Finance Limited. Market-wide impact is minimal as this involves only two specific debt ISINs reaching maturity/redemption. Investors holding these securities will follow standard redemption procedures as per the terms of the instruments.
