---

## Summary

NSE has issued a surveillance circular regarding the applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM). Four securities have been identified for inclusion under ST-ASM Stage I effective January 7, 2026, with enhanced margin requirements of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher, capped at 100%). Additionally, eight securities are being excluded from the ASM framework from the same date.

## Key Points

- 4 securities included in ST-ASM Stage I: CSB Bank Limited, Esprit Stones Limited, Manaksia Aluminium Company Limited, and Robust Hotels Limited
- Margin requirement: 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher, capped at 100%
- 8 securities to be excluded from ASM framework
- No securities shortlisted for ST-ASM Stage II
- No movements between Stage I and Stage II
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

This circular builds upon previous ASM circulars (NSE/SURV/39265 dated October 27, 2018, NSE/SURV/46557 dated December 04, 2020, NSE/SURV/52144 dated April 28, 2022, NSE/SURV/58558 dated September 25, 2023, and NSE/SURV/64066 dated September 20, 2024).

## Impact Assessment

**For Included Securities:**
The inclusion of 4 securities under ST-ASM Stage I will result in higher margin requirements, potentially reducing speculative trading activity and improving price stability. Traders and investors in these securities will face increased capital requirements, which may impact liquidity and trading volumes.

**For Excluded Securities:**
The exclusion of 8 securities from ASM framework provides relief by removing enhanced surveillance measures, potentially improving liquidity and reducing trading costs for market participants. This indicates that these securities have demonstrated improved price behavior and compliance with market norms.

**Market-Wide Impact:**
The surveillance measure is designed to curb excessive speculation and ensure orderly market conditions. Market participants should review their positions in affected securities and ensure adequate margin availability.
