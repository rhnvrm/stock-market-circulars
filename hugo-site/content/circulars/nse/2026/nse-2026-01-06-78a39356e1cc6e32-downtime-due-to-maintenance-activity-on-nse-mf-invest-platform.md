## Summary

NSE has announced a scheduled maintenance downtime for the NSE MF Invest Platform on January 10, 2026. The platform will be completely unavailable from 00:00 hrs to 02:00 hrs (2-hour window). Members are advised to refrain from all activities and transactions during this period and inform their technical teams and API vendors accordingly.

## Key Points

- Complete platform downtime scheduled for maintenance activity
- Duration: 2 hours (00:00 to 02:00 hrs on January 10, 2026)
- All transactions and activities must be suspended during the downtime window
- Members using API connectivity must inform their technical teams and vendors
- Contact support available at 1800 2100 940 or support@nseinvest.com

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational maintenance notification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must refrain from carrying out any activities and transactions on NSE MF Invest Platform during the specified downtime window
- Members connecting via API must notify their technical teams and vendors about the scheduled maintenance
- Members should plan their mutual fund investment activities accordingly to avoid disruption

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: January 6, 2026
- **Maintenance Start**: January 10, 2026, 00:00 hrs
- **Maintenance End**: January 10, 2026, 02:00 hrs
- **Total Downtime**: 2 hours

## Impact Assessment

The impact is moderate as the maintenance is scheduled during early morning hours (midnight to 2 AM) when mutual fund transaction activity is typically minimal. Members have 4 days advance notice to plan their operations. The 2-hour window is relatively short and should not significantly disrupt regular business operations. Members with automated systems or API integrations need to ensure their systems handle the downtime gracefully to avoid transaction failures.
