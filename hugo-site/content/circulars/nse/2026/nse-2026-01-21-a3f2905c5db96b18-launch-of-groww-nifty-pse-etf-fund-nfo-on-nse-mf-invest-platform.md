## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to a routine NFO launch. The impact is limited to:

- **Mutual Fund Distributors**: Need to onboard and offer the new ETF scheme to clients during the NFO period
- **Investors**: Opportunity to invest in a Public Sector Enterprises (PSE) focused ETF tracking the Nifty PSE index
- **Operational Impact**: Members must ensure proper fund settlement processes are in place for the NFO period

The launch expands investment options in the PSE sector through an ETF structure, providing cost-effective exposure to public sector enterprises for retail and institutional investors.
