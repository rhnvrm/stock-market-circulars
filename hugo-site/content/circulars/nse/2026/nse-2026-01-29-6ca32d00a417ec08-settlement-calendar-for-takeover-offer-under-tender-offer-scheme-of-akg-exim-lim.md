## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Members and custodians participating in the AKG Exim takeover offer must adjust their operations to comply with the specified settlement timeline. The requirement for early pay-in by 3:30 PM on the trade end date necessitates advance planning for demat share transfers.

**Market Impact**: Limited to participants in the AKG Exim tender offer. The 26 rejection codes provide clarity on potential order rejection scenarios, reducing uncertainty for participants. The conditional nature of the settlement schedule (subject to RTA and fund pay-in timing) may create some uncertainty.

**Administrative Impact**: Members must coordinate with depositories for early pay-in mechanism and monitor Tender Offer Acceptance Reports for order status. Contact support available via toll-free number 1800 266 00 50 (Option 2) or email ncl_tenderoffer@nsccl.co.in for clarifications.
