## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** High - This circular has significant operational implications for all market participants in the Capital Market Segment. The compression of three T+1 settlements into a single day (January 16, 2026) with staggered pay-in and pay-out timings requires careful coordination and resource planning.

**Settlement Operations:** Members must adjust their settlement processes to handle multiple settlement numbers on the same day with different pay-in/pay-out windows ranging from 08:00 hrs to 21:00 hrs.

**Liquidity Management:** The revised schedule may impact liquidity management as three settlements will be processed on January 16 instead of being spread across two days.

**Auction Cycle:** The auction schedule modification, particularly the skipping of auction for 2026011 with shortages carried forward to 2026012, requires members to adjust their risk management and funding arrangements.

**System Requirements:** Depositories and members need to ensure their systems can handle the revised cut-off timings and the compressed settlement schedule.

**Risk Considerations:** Members should note the extended pay-out time of 21:00 hrs for settlement 2026011, which may affect end-of-day reconciliation and reporting processes.
