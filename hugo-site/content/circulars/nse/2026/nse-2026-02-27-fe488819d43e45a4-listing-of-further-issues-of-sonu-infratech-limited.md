## Impact Assessment

The listing represents a relatively small further issue on the SME EMERGE platform and is unlikely to have any broad market impact. The preferential allotment at Rs. 75 per share increases the total paid-up share capital of Sonu Infratech Limited. A significant portion of newly listed shares (5,70,000 shares, ~40%) carry lock-in periods extending to August 2027, limiting near-term liquidity for those tranches. The remaining ~8,45,764 shares (~60%) have shorter lock-ins expiring in August 2026. Market participants in the SME segment should note the restricted tradability of locked-in shares and the temporary ISIN status pending SEBI activation.
