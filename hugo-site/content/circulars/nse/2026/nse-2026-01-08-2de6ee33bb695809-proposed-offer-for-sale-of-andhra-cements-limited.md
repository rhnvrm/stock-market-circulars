## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The OFS of 75 lakh shares of Andhra Cements Limited provides liquidity opportunity for investors in both retail and non-retail categories. The two-day bidding structure with carry forward mechanism allows flexibility for non-retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure technical readiness with eOFS platform access, admin user IDs, and compliance systems. The strict UCC compliance requirement (must be updated one day prior) and margin sufficiency checks require proactive operational planning. Members without proper setup may face participation barriers.

**Investor Impact**: Retail investors can participate with bids up to Rs. 2 lakhs, while non-retail investors have carry forward flexibility across the two bidding days. The low market lot of 1 share and small tick size (Re. 0.01) enables broad participation.
