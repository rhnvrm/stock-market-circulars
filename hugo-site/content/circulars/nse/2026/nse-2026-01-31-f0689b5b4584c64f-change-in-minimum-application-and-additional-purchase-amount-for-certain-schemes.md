title: Change in Minimum Application and Additional Purchase Amount for Bajaj Finserv
  Index Funds
---

## Summary

Bajaj Finserv Mutual Fund has announced changes to the minimum application and additional purchase amounts for two of its index fund schemes - Bajaj Finserv Nifty 50 Index Fund and Bajaj Finserv Nifty Next 50 Index Fund. The changes significantly increase the entry barrier for new investors, with fresh purchase minimums rising ten-fold from Rs. 500 to Rs. 5,000, and additional purchase minimums increasing from Rs. 100 to Rs. 1,000. These revisions will be effective from February 02, 2026.

## Key Points

- Minimum fresh purchase (lumpsum) amount increased from Rs. 500 to Rs. 5,000
- Additional purchase minimum raised from Rs. 100 to Rs. 1,000
- Minimum switch-in amount increased from Rs. 500 to Rs. 5,000
- Changes apply to Bajaj Finserv Nifty 50 Index Fund and Bajaj Finserv Nifty Next 50 Index Fund only
- All purchases remain in multiples of Re. 1 thereafter
- All other provisions of the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) remain unchanged
- Addendum forms integral part of SID and KIM

## Regulatory Changes

This is an administrative change to scheme parameters rather than a regulatory mandate. The change is being implemented through Notice-cum-Addendum No. 4 of 2026 issued by Bajaj Finserv Asset Management Limited, which serves as an addendum to the existing Scheme Information Documents and Key Information Memorandums.

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE MF Invest platform members must update their systems to reflect the new minimum investment amounts
- Investors seeking to make fresh purchases or additional investments must meet the revised minimum thresholds
- The revised limits apply to both direct purchases and switch-in transactions
- Distributors and intermediaries should inform prospective investors about the new minimum investment requirements

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: January 30, 2026
- **Addendum Date**: January 29, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 02, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this change is limited and primarily affects retail investors looking to enter these two specific index fund schemes. The ten-fold increase in minimum investment amounts may reduce accessibility for small retail investors but could help the fund manage operational costs associated with numerous small-value accounts. Existing investors and SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) contributors are not mentioned as being affected. The change does not impact market operations, trading activities, or listed securities. This is a fund-level administrative decision that aligns investment minimums with fund management preferences.
