- Demat shares initially credited under temporary ISIN IN8423A01049 as per SEBI circulars CIR/MRD/DP/21/2012 and CIR/MRD/DP/24/2012 regarding activation of ISIN for additional issues

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** This further issue represents a significant number of partly paid shares entering the market under a separate trading symbol. Investors should note these are distinct from fully paid shares of Adani Enterprises and will trade separately until fully paid.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to configure systems to recognize the new symbol ADANIENPP1 and ensure proper identification using the designated ISIN codes. The partly paid nature means remaining call money (Re. 0.25 per share) will be payable in future.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders are not directly affected as these shares rank pari passu. Investors purchasing these partly paid shares should be aware of future payment obligations and the temporary ISIN arrangement for demat holdings.
