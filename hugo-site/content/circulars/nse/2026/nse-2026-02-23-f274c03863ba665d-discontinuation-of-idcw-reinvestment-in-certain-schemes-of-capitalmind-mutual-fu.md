  on NSE MF Invest Platform
---

## Summary

NSE has notified members, via Circular Ref. No. NSE/NMFTM/72936 dated February 23, 2026, that Capitalmind Asset Management Private Limited and Capitalmind Trustee Private Limited have decided to discontinue the IDCW (Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal) Reinvestment option in two schemes of Capitalmind Mutual Fund on the NSE MF Invest Platform with immediate effect.

## Key Points

- The IDCW Reinvestment sub-option is discontinued in **Capitalmind Arbitrage Fund** and **Capitalmind Multi Asset Allocation Fund** effective February 23, 2026.
- Both Direct and Regular plans under these schemes are affected.
- The IDCW Payout option remains available; only the Reinvestment facility is being removed.
- The Growth option remains unaffected.
- Notice cum Addendum No. 006/2025-26 has been issued by Capitalmind Mutual Fund to formalize the change to the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM).
- NSE Download Ref No: NSE/NMFTM/72936; Circular Ref. No: 1217/2026.

## Regulatory Changes

The Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) for both affected schemes are being amended to remove the IDCW Reinvestment sub-option/facility. Post-change, the IDCW Option will only offer the Payout of Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) facility. The addendum is issued under SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE Members dealing with the NSE MF Invest Platform must take note of this change and ensure no new subscriptions are processed under the discontinued IDCW Reinvestment option for the affected schemes.
- Members should communicate this change to relevant investors holding or intending to invest in these schemes under the IDCW Reinvestment option.
- For queries, members may contact NSE at Toll Free No. 1800 2100 940 or email support@nseinvest.com.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** February 23, 2026 (immediate effect)
- **Circular Date:** February 23, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited in scope, affecting only existing and prospective investors in two specific Capitalmind Mutual Fund schemes who had opted for or intended to opt for the IDCW Reinvestment sub-option. Investors currently enrolled in IDCW Reinvestment may need to switch to IDCW Payout or the Growth option. There is no broader market or trading segment impact. The change is administrative and scheme-specific, initiated by the AMC and trustee company.
