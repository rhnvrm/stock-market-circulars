## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to a new mutual fund offering launch. The impact is limited to:

- Investors seeking exposure to silver through ETF fund-of-fund route
- NSE MF Invest Platform members who facilitate mutual fund transactions
- Bandhan Mutual Fund distribution network

The launch provides an additional investment option for silver exposure but does not affect broader market operations or introduce new compliance obligations beyond standard NFO procedures.
