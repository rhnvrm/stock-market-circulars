**Operational Impact**: Medium - Requires members and custodians to carefully manage ISIN transitions and quantity adjustments during early pay-in for SKMEGGPROD. Incorrect ISIN usage or quantity errors could lead to settlement failures.

**Market Impact**: Low to Medium - Limited to SKMEGGPROD holders and traders. The face value split increases share count but does not affect overall market capitalization.

**Member Action Required**: Members must update systems and processes to handle the ISIN transition correctly and educate clients about the split ratio and settlement procedures.
