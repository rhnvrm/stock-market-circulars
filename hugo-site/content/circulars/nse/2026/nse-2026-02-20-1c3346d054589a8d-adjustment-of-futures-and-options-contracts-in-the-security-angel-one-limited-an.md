title: Adjustment of Futures and Options Contracts in ANGEL ONE LIMITED (ANGELONE)
  for Face Value Split
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited (NCL) has issued procedures for adjusting Futures and Options (F&O) contracts in ANGEL ONE LIMITED (symbol: ANGELONE) on account of a face value split from Rs.10 per share to Rs.1 per share. The adjustment factor is 10, with an ex-date of February 26, 2026. All open F&O positions as of end of day February 25, 2026 will be adjusted accordingly.

## Key Points

- **Adjustment Factor:** 10 (face value split from Rs.10 to Rs.1 per share)
- **Ex-Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Reference Circulars:** SEBI circular SMDRP/DC/CIR-8/01 (June 21, 2001), NCL/CMPT/67750 (April 29, 2025), and NSE/FAOP/72897 (February 19, 2026)
- Futures positions will be multiplied by the adjusted market lot as per Circular 26/2026
- Futures prices will be divided by the adjustment factor of 10
- Options strike prices will be divided by the adjustment factor of 10
- Options positions will be multiplied by the adjusted market lot
- Carry-forward value computed using pre-adjusted quantity × pre-adjusted settlement price to avoid rounding errors
- Begin-of-day margins on February 26, 2026 will be based on adjusted carry-forward values

## Regulatory Changes

Pursuant to NSCCL Byelaws on Clearing and Settlement and SEBI circular SMDRP/DC/CIR-8/01 dated June 21, 2001, NSE Clearing Ltd. will apply a standardised adjustment methodology to all open ANGELONE F&O contracts. The adjusted market lot is as specified in Circular no. 26/2026 (NSE/FAOP/72897) dated February 19, 2026.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Clearing Members and Trading Members** must ensure awareness of adjusted position sizes and prices effective February 26, 2026
- All open positions in ANGELONE futures and options will be automatically adjusted by NSE Clearing Ltd. — no manual intervention required for the adjustment itself
- Members should update internal risk and margin systems to reflect adjusted contract specifications from February 26, 2026
- Intra-day margins from February 26, 2026 onward will be computed based on relevant traded prices at the time intra-day SPAN risk parameter files are generated

## Important Dates

- **February 25, 2026:** Last day before adjustment; all open ANGELONE F&O positions will be marked-to-market based on daily settlement price; adjusted positions carried forward at adjusted value
- **February 26, 2026 (Ex-Date):** Adjusted contracts take effect; begin-of-day margins computed on adjusted carry-forward values; normal daily MTM settlement resumes under adjusted parameters

## Impact Assessment

All holders of open ANGELONE futures and options contracts will see their positions, prices, and strike prices adjusted by a factor of 10. For futures: the number of contracts (in lots) increases by 10x while the price per unit decreases by 10x, keeping overall economic exposure neutral. For options: strike prices are reduced to 1/10th and position sizes increase proportionally. Traders and risk managers must update their systems before the February 26, 2026 ex-date. Margin requirements will shift in line with adjusted values. The adjustment is value-neutral by design but operationally significant for all market participants with open ANGELONE derivatives positions.
