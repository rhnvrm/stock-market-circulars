## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it announces a routine NFO launch for a sectoral ETF. The impact is limited to:

- **Investors**: Provides a new investment option for gaining exposure to the healthcare sector through the Nifty 500 HealthCare Index
- **NSE Members**: Operational requirement to facilitate NFO subscriptions through the NSE MF Invest Platform
- **Market**: No direct impact on trading or market operations; adds to the growing universe of sectoral ETF products in India

The healthcare sector ETF may attract investors looking for targeted exposure to pharmaceutical, hospital, and healthcare companies within the Nifty 500 universe.
