## Summary

NSE has notified that 24 companies will continue trading in Z Category (BZ/SZ Series) effective January 27, 2026, due to non-compliance with Regulation 33 of SEBI Listing Regulations. These companies failed to submit financial results for two consecutive quarters (June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025; for SME companies March 31, 2025 and September 30, 2025). All securities were already in Z Category under previous circulars and will continue trade-for-trade settlement.

## Key Points

- Non-compliance period: Two consecutive quarters (Q1 and Q2 FY2025-26 for regular companies; Q4 FY2024-25 and Q2 FY2025-26 for SME companies)
- All affected securities already trading in Z Category pursuant to various previous NSE circulars
- Continuation of Z Category classification effective from January 27, 2026
- Trade-for-trade settlement basis mandatory for all transactions
- Action taken pursuant to SEBI Master Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024

## Regulatory Changes

The Z Category classification is a continuation of existing surveillance measures already applied to these securities under previous exchange circulars.
