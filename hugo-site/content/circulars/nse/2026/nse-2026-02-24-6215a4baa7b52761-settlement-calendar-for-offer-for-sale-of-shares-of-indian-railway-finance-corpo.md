## Impact Assessment

This circular has a moderate operational impact on members, custodians, and PCMs participating in the IRFC OFS. Participants must ensure timely custodial confirmations and fund availability to avoid settlement failures. The dual-day OFS structure (non-retail on Day 1, retail + non-retail on Day 2) requires careful scheduling of internal operations. No systemic market impact is anticipated beyond the specific participants in this OFS.
