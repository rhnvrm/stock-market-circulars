title: Introduction of Daily Frequency Under Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) for NJ
  Mutual Fund
---

## Summary

National Stock Exchange of India has announced that NJ Mutual Fund will introduce a Daily frequency option under Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) facility on the NSE MF Invest Platform, effective February 2, 2026. This enhancement allows investors to transfer fixed amounts on a daily basis from eligible source schemes to target schemes, supplementing the existing STP frequency options.

## Key Points

- Daily STP frequency introduced for NJ Mutual Fund schemes effective February 2, 2026
- Minimum transfer amount: Rs. 500/- and multiples of Re. 1/- thereafter
- For ELSS target schemes, amounts must be in multiples of Rs. 500/- only
- Minimum installments required: 12
- STP transfers will occur on all business days
- Default start date: 5th business day following request submission if not specified
- End date considered perpetual unless specified, but STP registration ceases after three consecutive installment failures
- Trustees/AMC reserves right to modify or discontinue facility prospectively

## Regulatory Changes

This is a product enhancement rather than a regulatory change. The notice-cum-addendum will form an integral part of the Scheme Information Document (SID), Key Information Memorandum (KIM), and Statement of Additional Information (SAI) of NJ Mutual Fund schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- NJ Mutual Fund members and distributors should update their systems to accommodate daily STP frequency option
- Investors must ensure minimum transfer amount of Rs. 500/- per installment
- For ELSS target schemes, transfer amounts must be in multiples of Rs. 500/-
- Minimum 12 installments required for daily STP enrollment

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** January 30, 2026
- **Effective Date:** February 2, 2026
- **Notice cum Addendum Date:** January 28, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it represents an operational enhancement to existing mutual fund investment facilities. The introduction of daily STP frequency provides investors with more flexibility in portfolio rebalancing and rupee-cost averaging strategies. Impact is limited to NJ Mutual Fund investors and does not affect broader market operations or compliance requirements for trading members.
