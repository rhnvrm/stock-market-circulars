## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. Routine listing of further issues through ESOP schemes and preferential allotments. The largest addition is Biocon's 171.28 million shares on preferential basis, which will increase the company's equity base. All shares are pari passu with existing securities.

**Trading Impact**: No changes to trading mechanisms. Market lot remains 1 for all securities. Securities identified by designated codes as per standard procedures.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in available shares for the listed companies. ESOP allotments are typically small in number. Biocon's preferential allotment is subject to lock-in until July 13, 2026, limiting immediate trading impact.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should note dilution from new equity issuances. Lock-in periods apply to preferential allotments and warrant conversions, providing some stability during the lock-in phase.
