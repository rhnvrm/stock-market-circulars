## Summary

NSE has issued a circular under Regulation 3.1.2 of the National Stock Exchange Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A, notifying the suspension of trading in two privately placed non-convertible securities effective February 26, 2026. Both securities are being suspended due to redemption — Tata Capital Limited (INE306N07NL3) and Tata Capital Housing Finance Limited (INE033L08254).

## Key Points

- Two non-convertible securities are suspended from trading on the NSE debt market effective February 26, 2026.
- Suspension is triggered by redemption of both instruments.
- Tata Capital Limited: ISIN INE306N07NL3 suspended from 26-Feb-2026.
- Tata Capital Housing Finance Limited: ISIN INE033L08254 suspended from 26-Feb-2026.
- Circular issued under Regulation 3.1.2 of NSE Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular is an operational notification under the existing Regulation 3.1.2 of the National Stock Exchange Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A, which governs suspension of debt securities upon redemption or other qualifying events.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members of NSE are notified to cease trading in the two specified ISINs from February 26, 2026 onwards.
- No action required by members beyond acknowledging the suspension and ensuring no trades are executed in these securities post the effective date.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 25, 2026
- **Suspension Effective Date:** February 26, 2026 (for both ISINs)

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited and routine. Both suspensions are due to redemption, meaning the securities have reached maturity and are being retired. Existing holders will receive redemption proceeds per the terms of the instruments. There is no unexpected market disruption. Members trading in the NSE debt segment should update their systems to reflect the suspension of ISINs INE306N07NL3 and INE033L08254 effective February 26, 2026.
