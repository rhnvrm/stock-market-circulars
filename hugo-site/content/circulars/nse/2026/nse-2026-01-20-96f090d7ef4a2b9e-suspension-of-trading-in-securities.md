## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Complete halt in normal trading for five listed companies
- Significant liquidity impact for existing shareholders
- Limited trading window (once weekly) after initial 15-day suspension period
- Potential price discovery challenges due to restricted trading

**Investor Impact:**
- Existing shareholders unable to exit positions during suspension period
- Increased transaction costs and reduced liquidity in Trade for Trade category
- Higher compliance risk perception for these securities

**Company Impact:**
- Reputational damage from regulatory non-compliance
- Restricted access to capital markets
- Potential delisting risk if non-compliance continues
- Loss of investor confidence

**Severity Assessment:**
High severity due to complete trading suspension affecting investor rights and market access. The progressive penalty structure (full suspension followed by restricted Trade for Trade) indicates serious regulatory concern about ongoing non-compliance with fundamental disclosure requirements.
