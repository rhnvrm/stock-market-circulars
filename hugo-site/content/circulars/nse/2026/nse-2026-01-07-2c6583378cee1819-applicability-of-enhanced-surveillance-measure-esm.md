- Minimum 100% margin on all positions (open and new)
- Shift to Trade-for-Trade segment (no intraday trading)
- Securities moving to Stage-II face additional restrictions including 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction

This circular references previous ESM circulars: NSE/SURV/56948 (June 02, 2023), NSE/SURV/57609 (July 18, 2023), NSE/SURV/63361 (August 09, 2024), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), NSE/SURV/64400 (October 04, 2024), and NSE/SURV/69315 (July 25, 2025).

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**

**For Investors:**
- All purchases and sales must result in delivery (no intraday squaring off)

- **January 09, 2026**: Security shifts from EQ/SM to BE/ST series; 100% margin applies to all new positions; Trade-for-Trade trading begins

## Impact Assessment

- Significantly reduced liquidity for Hardwyn India Limited as intraday trading is prohibited
- Higher capital requirements due to 100% margin mandate will likely reduce trading volumes
- Price discovery may be affected due to Trade-for-Trade restrictions
- Existing position holders will face increased margin requirements

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members must update risk management systems to enforce 100% margins
- Brokers need to communicate changes to clients holding or interested in trading HARDWYN
- Settlement processes shift to compulsory delivery-based settlement

**Investor Impact:**
- High impact on traders and speculators due to elimination of leverage and intraday trading
- Increased holding costs due to full margin requirements
- Potential difficulty in exiting positions due to reduced liquidity
