**Trading Impact:** Negligible impact on liquidity or price discovery. The shares are pari passu with existing shares and have no lock-in restrictions, allowing immediate trading.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders experience minimal dilution. The largest single allotment is Restaurant Brands Asia with 296,835 shares, which is typically a small fraction of total equity.

**Operational Impact:** Standard listing procedures apply. No special systems changes or trading restrictions required.
