## Summary

NSE has issued a circular notifying the withdrawal of admission to dealings (delisting) of equity shares of Fedders Electric and Engineering Limited (Symbol: FEDDERELEC) with effect from March 02, 2026. The delisting is pursuant to a Resolution Plan approved by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Allahabad Bench, Prayagraj, under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.

## Key Points

- Equity shares of Fedders Electric and Engineering Limited (FEDDERELEC) will be delisted from NSE effective March 02, 2026.
- The delisting is classified as voluntary but is driven by an NCLT-approved Resolution Plan under insolvency proceedings.
- The legal basis is Section 31 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, read with Regulation 39(4) of the IBBI (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016.
- The circular is addressed to all NSE members.

## Regulatory Changes

The admission to dealings in securities of Fedders Electric and Engineering Limited on NSE shall be withdrawn (delisted) pursuant to:
- **Section 31, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016**: Pertaining to approval of resolution plans.
- **Regulation 39(4) of IBBI (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016**: Governing the delisting consequent to an approved resolution plan.

## Compliance Requirements

- **NSE Members**: Must cease trading in FEDDERELEC equity shares from March 02, 2026 onwards.
- **Investors/Shareholders**: Should be aware that trading in FEDDERELEC will no longer be available on NSE post the effective date. Shareholders should consult the resolution plan details and relevant NCLT orders for their rights and entitlements.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: February 23, 2026
- **Effective Delisting Date**: March 02, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The delisting of FEDDERELEC will have a significant impact on existing shareholders, as the shares will no longer be tradeable on NSE from March 02, 2026. This is an insolvency-driven delisting under NCLT's resolution plan approval, meaning shareholders' recovery or compensation (if any) will be governed by the terms of the approved Resolution Plan rather than open-market trading. Investors holding FEDDERELEC shares should review the NCLT order and the Resolution Plan for details on their entitlements. Members should update their systems to reflect the suspension of trading in this security from the effective date.
