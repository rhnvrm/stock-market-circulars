## Summary

National Stock Exchange of India has announced a change in the ISIN code for Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited (KOTAKBANK) effective January 14, 2026. The new ISIN code INE237A01036 will replace the existing code due to the sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs. 5/- to Re. 1/-. The new ISIN will be applicable for all trades executed on and from the ex-date.

## Key Points

- New ISIN code: INE237A01036
- Effective date: January 14, 2026 (ex-date)
- Reason: Sub-division of shares from Rs. 5/- to Re. 1/-
- Symbol: KOTAKBANK remains unchanged
- All trades from ex-date onwards will use the new ISIN

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action notification for ISIN modification following share sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members and market participants must update their systems with the new ISIN code INE237A01036 before January 14, 2026
- Ensure all trading and settlement systems reflect the new ISIN for trades executed on or after the ex-date
- Update client holdings and records to reflect the new ISIN post sub-division

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** January 08, 2026
- **Ex-Date (Effective Date):** January 14, 2026 - New ISIN becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on market operations. The ISIN change affects:

- **Trading Systems:** All trading platforms must be updated with the new ISIN code
- **Settlement Systems:** Back-office and settlement systems need configuration changes
- **Investor Holdings:** Depository participants must update client holdings with new ISIN
- **Reporting:** All regulatory reporting must use the new ISIN for trades from ex-date
- **Market Impact:** No direct impact on stock price or liquidity, but system readiness is critical to avoid trading disruptions

The share sub-division (5:1 split) will increase the number of outstanding shares five-fold while reducing the face value, making shares more affordable for retail investors.
