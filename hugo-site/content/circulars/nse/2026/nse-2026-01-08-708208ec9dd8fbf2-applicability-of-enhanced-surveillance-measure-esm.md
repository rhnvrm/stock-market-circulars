## Summary

NSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective January 9-12, 2026. Goyal Aluminiums Limited (GOYALALUM) has been included in ESM Stage-I and will attract a minimum 100% margin requirement on all positions. The security will be shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST). Divine Power Energy Limited (DPEL) is being moved from ESM Stage-I to Stage-II with stricter trading conditions including periodic call auction with 2% price band.

- GOYALALUM to shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM series) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST series) from January 12, 2026
- DPEL (Divine Power Energy Limited, INE0SCO01019) moving from Stage-I to Stage-II ESM
- Stage-II securities placed under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction from January 9, 2026
- No securities excluded from ESM framework in this update
- No securities moving from Stage-II back to Stage-I
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements changes to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework originally established through circulars NSE/SURV/56948 (June 2, 2023), NSE/SURV/57609 (July 18, 2023), NSE/SURV/63361 (August 9, 2024), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), NSE/SURV/64400 (October 4, 2024), and NSE/SURV/69315 (July 25, 2025).

Stage-I ESM now includes:
- Minimum 100% margin on all positions
- Shift to Trade-for-Trade segment (no intraday trading)
- Settlement in demat form only

Stage-II ESM features:
- Trade-for-Trade segment with no intraday trading
- Periodic Call Auction mechanism
- 2% price band restriction
- Enhanced margin requirements

## Compliance Requirements

**For Market Participants:**
- Ensure adequate margin coverage of 100% for GOYALALUM positions by January 12, 2026
- Adjust trading strategies for affected securities moving to Trade-for-Trade segment
- Note segment series changes: EQ/SM to BE/ST for Stage-I securities
- Prepare for Periodic Call Auction trading mechanism for Stage-II securities
- Maintain compliance with all existing surveillance measures in conjunction with ESM

**For Members:**
- Review client positions in affected securities
- Communicate margin requirements and trading restrictions to clients
- Update risk management systems for new ESM classifications

## Important Dates

- **January 8, 2026**: Circular issuance date
- **January 9, 2026**: 
  - ESM changes become effective
  - 100% margin applicable on existing open positions in GOYALALUM
  - DPEL shifts to Stage-II with Periodic Call Auction and 2% price band
- **January 12, 2026**: 
  - GOYALALUM shifts from EQ/SM to BE/ST segment
  - 100% margin applicable on new positions created in GOYALALUM

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- **GOYALALUM**: Severe liquidity impact due to 100% margin requirement and Trade-for-Trade segment classification. No intraday trading permitted, which will significantly reduce trading volumes and liquidity.
- **DPEL**: Movement to Stage-II represents escalation of surveillance concerns. Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band will restrict price discovery and trading flexibility.

**Operational Impact:**
- Increased margin requirements will tie up additional capital for traders holding positions
- Trade-for-Trade mechanism requires delivery-based settlement, eliminating speculative intraday positions
- Periodic Call Auction restricts continuous trading, affecting order execution and timing
- Price band limitation may prevent fair price discovery during volatile periods

**Investor Considerations:**
- ESM classification indicates heightened surveillance concerns but should not be construed as adverse action against the company
- Enhanced margins and trading restrictions aim to curb excessive speculation
- Investors should review positions and assess risk-reward given new trading constraints
- Historical volatility and price movements likely triggered ESM inclusion criteria
