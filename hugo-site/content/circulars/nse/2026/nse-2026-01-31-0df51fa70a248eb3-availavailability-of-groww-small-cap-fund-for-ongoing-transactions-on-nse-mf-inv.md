## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it relates specifically to the operational availability of one mutual fund scheme on the NSE platform. Investors who were previously unable to transact in Groww Small Cap Fund will regain access to subscriptions, redemptions, and systematic investment options. The reopening suggests the fund may have been temporarily closed for new subscriptions, possibly due to asset size management considerations.
