---

## Summary

NSE has notified the listing of further securities for 17 companies on the Capital Market segment, effective February 26, 2026, pursuant to Regulation 3.1.1 of the NSE (Capital Market) Trading Regulations Part A. The majority of allotments are under Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP), with one allotment (Himadri Speciality Chemical) arising from conversion of preferential warrants.

## Key Points

- Securities for 17 companies admitted to dealings on NSE Capital Market segment from February 26, 2026
- Lot sizes for all newly listed securities are 1 (market lot)
- All securities are Pari Passu with existing equity shares
- Most allotments carry no lock-in; Himadri Speciality Chemical warrant conversion shares are locked in until August 30, 2026
- Securities are identified solely by their designated NSE codes for trading purposes
- Allotment dates range from November 2025 to February 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular is issued in routine pursuance of:
- Regulation 3.1.1 of NSE (Capital Market) Trading Regulations Part A — admission of securities to dealings
- Regulation 2.5.5 of NSE (Capital Market) Trading Regulations Part A — lot size specification

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use designated security codes for all transactions in these securities
- Trading must be conducted in the specified lot sizes (market lot of 1 for all listed securities)
- No additional compliance action required from general market participants

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** February 26, 2026 — securities admitted to trading on NSE
- **Allotment Dates by Company:**
  - Centum Electronics Limited: February 14, 2026 (4,833 shares, ESOP)
  - CREDITACCESS GRAMEEN LIMITED: February 19, 2026 (11,675 shares, ESOP)
  - EPL Limited: February 18, 2026 (13,942 shares, ESOP)
  - The Federal Bank Limited: February 23, 2026 (4,18,906 shares, ESOP)

- **Lock-in Expiry:** August 30, 2026 — for Himadri Speciality Chemical warrant conversion shares

## Impact Assessment

The circular has minimal market impact as these are routine further-issue listings of small tranches of equity shares primarily under ESOP schemes. The incremental share counts are small relative to existing paid-up capital for large-cap companies such as ICICI Bank and Federal Bank. The Himadri Speciality Chemical allotment (warrant conversion at Rs. 316 per share) carries a lock-in until August 2026, limiting near-term supply. No broad market or regulatory implications arise from this circular.
