title: Applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - January 2026
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a circular updating the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework. One security (Kody Technolab Limited) has been newly included in ESM Stage-I effective January 23, 2026. The affected security will be shifted from rolling settlement (EQ/SM series) to trade-for-trade segment (BE/ST series) from January 27, 2026, and will attract a minimum 100% margin on all open and new positions. No securities are being excluded from the ESM framework or moved between stages.

## Key Points

- Kody Technolab Limited (Symbol: KODYTECH, ISIN: INE0Q7P01013) added to ESM Stage-I
- 100% margin requirement applicable on all open positions as on January 23, 2026, and new positions from January 27, 2026
- Security will shift from Rolling Settlement segment (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST) from January 27, 2026
- Securities moving to Stage-II will be under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction from January 23, 2026
- No securities are being excluded from ESM framework (Annexure II shows Nil)
- No securities are moving between Stage-I and Stage-II
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Consolidated ESM list includes multiple securities including Alps Industries Limited, Anondita Medicare Limited, Dhariwalcorp Limited, and others in Stage-II

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework continues to apply enhanced surveillance measures on securities meeting specific criteria. Securities under ESM are subject to:

- Minimum 100% margin requirement on all positions
- Migration from normal rolling settlement to trade-for-trade settlement
- Stage-II securities additionally face periodic call auction with 2% price band
- Enhanced monitoring by the exchange surveillance department

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must ensure 100% margin collection for KODYTECH effective January 27, 2026
- Margins apply to both existing open positions (as on January 23, 2026) and all new positions created from January 27, 2026
- Trading members must comply with trade-for-trade settlement requirements (no intraday squaring off)
- Members should inform clients about the enhanced surveillance status and associated trading restrictions
- All positions must be delivered or settled; no netting of buy and sell trades

## Important Dates

- **January 22, 2026**: Circular issued (Ref No: NSE/SURV/72443, Circular No: 55/2026)
- **January 23, 2026**: ESM inclusion effective date; Stage-II securities move to Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- **January 27, 2026**: 100% margin requirement becomes applicable; KODYTECH shifts from EQ/SM to BE/ST series

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ESM face severe liquidity constraints due to trade-for-trade settlement requirements, eliminating intraday trading opportunities. The 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital costs for traders and investors.

**Market Participants**: Retail and institutional traders holding positions in KODYTECH must arrange for full margin by January 27, 2026. Existing positions as on January 23, 2026, will also require 100% margin.

**Investor Implications**: The ESM designation serves as a warning signal about potential price manipulation, volatility, or other surveillance concerns. While not an adverse action against the company, it indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny.

**Liquidity Impact**: Trade-for-trade settlement typically reduces trading volumes and liquidity as it prevents intraday speculation and requires mandatory delivery of all trades.

**Price Volatility**: Enhanced surveillance measures may lead to increased price volatility in the short term as traders adjust positions to meet margin requirements and adapt to new trading restrictions.
