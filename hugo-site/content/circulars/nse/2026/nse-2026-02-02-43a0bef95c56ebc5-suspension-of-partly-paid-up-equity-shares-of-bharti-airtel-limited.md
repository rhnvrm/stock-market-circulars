## Impact Assessment

The suspension specifically affects holders of partly paid-up equity shares of Bharti Airtel Limited (AIRTELPP). This is distinct from the company's regular fully paid equity shares. The suspension is procedural in nature, related to the collection of first and final call money on these partly paid shares. Investors holding AIRTELPP will not be able to trade these securities on NSE after February 05, 2026. This typically occurs as part of the conversion process from partly paid to fully paid shares once call money is collected. The impact is limited to holders of this specific security class and does not affect regular Bharti Airtel equity shares.
