The measure requires a margin of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at 100%, effective January 29, 2026. Additionally, three securities - Dolphin Offshore Enterprises, Excellent Wires and Packaging Limited, and Shree Rama Multi-Tech Limited - are being excluded from the ASM framework.

- Enhanced margin requirement of 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher, subject to maximum of 100%
- Margin applies to all open positions as on January 28, 2026 and new positions from January 29, 2026
- Three securities excluded from ASM framework: DOLPHIN (INE920A01037), EXCELLENT (INE0Y4801011), and SHREERAMA (INE879A01019)

- No securities listed in ST-ASM Stage II

The ST-ASM is a surveillance mechanism to monitor securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or trading patterns.

## Important Dates

- **January 27, 2026**: Circular issued
- **January 28, 2026**: Effective date for securities inclusion/exclusion from ASM framework

## Impact Assessment

**Securities Added to ST-ASM Stage I:**
- Traders holding positions in BHARATRAS and DBOL will face increased margin requirements, potentially requiring additional capital deployment
- Higher margins may reduce trading volumes and liquidity in these securities
- Increased cost of carry for positions may discourage speculative trading

**Securities Excluded from ASM:**
- DOLPHIN, EXCELLENT, and SHREERAMA will no longer face ASM-related restrictions
- Normal margin requirements will apply to these securities
- May improve liquidity and reduce trading costs for these stocks

**Market Impact:**
- Limited overall market impact as only two securities added to surveillance
- Exchange emphasizes this is a surveillance action and not adverse action against companies
- Measure aims to curb excessive speculation and abnormal price movements
