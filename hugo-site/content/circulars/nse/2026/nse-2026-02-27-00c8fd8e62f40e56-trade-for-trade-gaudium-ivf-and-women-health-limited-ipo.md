  Limited (IPO)
---

## Summary

NSE has announced that Gaudium IVF and Women Health Limited (symbol: GAUDIUMIVF) will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (Series: BE) to the Rolling segment (Series: EQ) effective March 16, 2026. This follows Exchange Circular NSE/CML/73013 dated February 26, 2026 and is in accordance with SEBI guidelines (CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012).

## Key Points

- GAUDIUMIVF will move from Trade for Trade (Series BE) to Rolling Segment (Series EQ) from March 16, 2026
- The transfer is pursuant to SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012
- This follows the earlier NSE circular NSE/CML/73013 issued on February 26, 2026 related to the IPO listing
- Circular reference: 0337/2026, Download Ref No: NSE/CML/73031

## Regulatory Changes

The securities of Gaudium IVF and Women Health Limited are being moved out of the mandatory Trade for Trade (T+1, no netting) settlement mechanism applicable during the initial IPO listing period and into the standard Rolling Settlement (EQ series), enabling normal intraday trading and netting of positions.

## Compliance Requirements

- All trading members must update their systems to reflect the series change from BE to EQ for GAUDIUMIVF effective March 16, 2026
- Members should ensure clients are informed of the segment change and its implications for trading and settlement

## Important Dates

- **February 26, 2026**: Original IPO listing circular issued (NSE/CML/73013)
- **February 27, 2026**: This circular issued (NSE/CML/73031)
- **March 16, 2026**: Effective date of transfer from Trade for Trade (BE) to Rolling Segment (EQ)

## Impact Assessment

This is a standard post-IPO transition for GAUDIUMIVF. Once moved to the EQ series, traders and investors will be able to engage in intraday trading and benefit from netting of positions, increasing liquidity and trading flexibility. The BE series restriction is typically applied during early post-listing days to ensure price discovery and reduce volatility. The shift to EQ signals the stock has stabilised sufficiently for normal rolling settlement.
