**Issuer Highlights:**
- **IIFL Finance** has the largest CP issuance by quantity (17,000 units; ~₹850 crore face value).
- **MMFSL** issued 15,000 units (~₹750 crore face value) with a 12-month tenor.
- **Angel One** CP carries the highest implied discount (issue price ₹4,61,577.50 vs ₹5,00,000 face value, ~8.3% annualised yield).
- **NABARD's** bond listing (7.01% coupon, 2029 maturity) is of interest to long-duration debt investors.

**Operational Impact — Low.** Debt market members need to onboard the new ISINs; no system-wide changes required.
