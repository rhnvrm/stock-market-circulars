---

## Summary

NSE's Listing Department has informed all members that the face value and paid-up value of the LIC MF Gold Exchange Traded Fund (symbol: LICMFGOLD), managed by LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Limited, will undergo a split from Rs. 100 to Re. 1 per unit, effective March 6, 2026.

## Key Points

- The ETF affected is **LIC MF Gold Exchange Traded Fund** (NSE Symbol: **LICMFGOLD**).
- Face value split ratio: Rs. 100 → Re. 1 (100:1 split).
- Both face value and paid-up value will change simultaneously.
- The circular was issued under Download Ref No: NSE/CML/73020 and Circular Ref. No: 0329/2026.

## Regulatory Changes

The face value and paid-up value of LICMFGOLD units will be revised downward from Rs. 100 to Re. 1 per unit as a result of this corporate action. This is a structural change to the ETF's unit denomination, not a change in the underlying asset value.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members are required to take note of this face value change.
- Members dealing in LICMFGOLD must update their records and systems to reflect the new face value of Re. 1 effective March 6, 2026.
- Clearing and settlement systems should account for the revised paid-up value from the effective date.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 26, 2026
- **Effective Date of Face Value Split:** March 6, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The face value split of LICMFGOLD from Rs. 100 to Re. 1 will increase the number of units in circulation proportionally, making the ETF more accessible to retail investors at a lower per-unit price. This is a routine corporate action for ETFs aimed at improving liquidity and affordability. Existing unitholders will see their unit count adjusted accordingly with no change in the overall value of their holdings. Members and custodians should ensure their back-office systems reflect the updated face value from March 6, 2026.
