- Maximum margin rate is capped at 100%
- Members must ensure compliance with ASM framework alongside other prevailing surveillance measures
- Price band will be reinstated to pre-ASM levels when securities exit the framework, unless subject to other surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **January 23, 2026**: Circular issued
- **January 27, 2026**: Securities shortlisted under ST-ASM Stage I (effective date)
- **January 28, 2026**: Enhanced margin requirements of 50% come into effect for open positions and new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The 50% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for traders holding positions in these 5 securities, which may reduce trading volumes and liquidity.

**Cost Impact**: Higher margins increase the cost of carry for positions, potentially making short-term trading strategies less viable.

**Market Perception**: While NSE clarifies this is not an adverse action against companies, the ST-ASM classification signals heightened volatility or unusual price movements that triggered surveillance criteria.

**Investor Considerations**: Existing position holders must ensure adequate margin by January 28, 2026 to avoid forced liquidation. New investors should be aware of elevated margin requirements before entering positions.
