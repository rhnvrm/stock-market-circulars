title: Applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

NSE has placed 16 securities under Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I effective February 06, 2026. The surveillance action requires a margin of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher, capped at 100%) on all open positions and new positions created from February 09, 2026. This measure is purely for market surveillance and should not be construed as adverse action against the companies.

## Key Points

- 16 securities included under ST-ASM Stage I framework
- Margin requirement: 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher (maximum 100%)
- Applies to all open positions as on February 06, 2026
- Applies to new positions created from February 09, 2026 onwards
- No securities moved to Stage II or transitioned between stages
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is for market surveillance purposes only, not adverse action against companies

This circular follows previous ASM-related circulars: NSE/SURV/39265 (October 27, 2018), NSE/SURV/46557 (December 04, 2020), NSE/SURV/52144 (April 28, 2022), NSE/SURV/58558 (September 25, 2023), and NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024).

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must collect and maintain minimum 50% margin (or existing margin if higher, capped at 100%) for all positions in the 16 listed securities
- **Clients**: Must provide adequate margins as per the new requirements
- **Risk Management Systems**: Update margin calculations to reflect ST-ASM Stage I requirements
- Margin applies to both existing open positions and new positions created from the effective date
- Members should refer to NSE's Additional Surveillance Measure FAQs at https://www.nseindia.com/regulations/additional-surveillance-measure
- For queries, contact surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **February 05, 2026**: Circular issued (Circular Ref. No: 93/2026)
- **February 06, 2026**: Securities included under ST-ASM Stage I (effective date for classification)
- **February 09, 2026**: Enhanced margin requirements (50% or existing margin, whichever is higher) become applicable on:
  - All open positions as on February 06, 2026
  - New positions created from this date onwards

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The 50% minimum margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for traders and investors holding positions in these 16 securities. This will likely reduce speculative activity and potentially impact liquidity in these stocks.

**Cost Implications**: Traders with existing positions must arrange additional funds to meet the enhanced margin requirements by February 09, 2026, or face potential position squaring.

**Market Sentiment**: While NSE clarifies this is a surveillance measure and not adverse action, the inclusion may create negative sentiment and increase volatility in the affected securities.

**Broker Operations**: Brokers need to update their risk management systems, communicate with affected clients, and ensure compliance with the new margin framework within the specified timeline.

**Liquidity Considerations**: Higher margin requirements typically reduce trading volumes and liquidity, which may widen bid-ask spreads and increase price volatility in these securities.
