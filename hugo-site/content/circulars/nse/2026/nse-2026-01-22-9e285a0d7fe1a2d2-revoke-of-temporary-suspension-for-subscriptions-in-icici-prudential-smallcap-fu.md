## Summary

NSE has lifted the temporary suspension on subscriptions for ICICI Prudential Smallcap Fund effective January 23, 2026. The ICICI Prudential Trustee has approved resumption of all subscription modes including fresh/additional purchases through lumpsum, switch-ins, and new registrations for Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and Systematic Transfer Plan (STP). All previous PAN-level investment amount restrictions have been withdrawn.

## Key Points

- Resumption of ICICI Prudential Smallcap Fund subscriptions effective January 23, 2026
- All investment modes now available: lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, SIP, and STP
- Complete withdrawal of PAN-level investment amount restrictions
- Approved by ICICI Prudential Trust Limited
- Available on NSE MF Invest Platform
- Circular reference: NSE/NMFTM/72441, dated January 22, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

The temporary suspension previously imposed on ICICI Prudential Smallcap Fund has been revoked. The AMC will now accept transactions through all modes without any restrictions on investment amounts at the PAN level. This reverses earlier limitations that had been placed on new subscriptions to the scheme.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members and investors can resume investments in the scheme from January 23, 2026
- All transaction modes are permitted: fresh purchases, additional purchases, lumpsum investments, switch-ins, and fresh SIP/STP registrations
- Investors are requested to periodically review and update their KYC details including mobile number and email ID
- Standard mutual fund compliance applies: market risks disclosure and requirement to read all scheme-related documents

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: January 22, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 23, 2026 - Resumption of all subscription modes for ICICI Prudential Smallcap Fund
- **Addendum Date**: January 21, 2026 - Notice-cum-addendum issued by ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company Limited

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The reopening provides investors renewed access to smallcap equity exposure through a major fund house. This may result in increased inflows to the smallcap segment, though impact is limited to one fund scheme.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for investors who were previously unable to invest or add to their positions in this smallcap fund. The removal of PAN-level restrictions eliminates investment amount caps that may have been in place.

**Operational Impact**: Fund houses and distributors can now process all types of subscription requests without restrictions. The NSE MF Invest Platform will facilitate all transaction modes for this scheme starting January 23, 2026.
