title: Mock Trading on Saturday, February 28, 2026 - UCC Unavailability Notice
---

## Summary

NSE's Investor Services Cell has issued a notice to all members regarding a Mock Trading session scheduled for Saturday, February 28, 2026. As a consequence, the Unique Client Code (UCC) live environment will be unavailable from 6 AM till midnight on that day. Members must refrain from any UCC modifications during this window, as such changes will be purged and will not be valid for live trading on Monday, March 02, 2026.

## Key Points

- Mock Trading session is scheduled for Saturday, February 28, 2026
- This circular supplements earlier exchange circulars: NSE/CMTR/73057, NSE/FAOP/73056, NSE/CD/73047, NSE/COM/73050, and NSE/SLBS/73053 dated February 27, 2026
- UCC live environment will be unavailable from **6 AM to midnight** on February 28, 2026
- Any UCC records added or modified during the unavailability window will be purged by end of day on February 28, 2026
- Purged UCC records will not be valid for the live trading session starting Monday, March 02, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a temporary operational restriction tied to the mock trading event on February 28, 2026.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must refrain from making any UCC modifications or uploads between 6 AM and midnight on Saturday, February 28, 2026
- Members who need to add or modify UCC data must do so either before 6 AM on February 28, 2026, or after midnight (i.e., from March 1, 2026 onwards) to ensure validity for live trading on March 02, 2026
- Members should plan their UCC updates in advance to avoid disruption to Monday's trading session

## Important Dates

- **February 28, 2026 (6 AM – Midnight)**: UCC live environment unavailable; no modifications should be made
- **February 28, 2026 (End of Day)**: Purge of any UCC records added or modified during the restricted window
- **March 02, 2026**: Next live trading session; UCC records modified during the blackout will not be valid

## Impact Assessment

This notice has a moderate operational impact on NSE members who manage Unique Client Codes. The restriction spans the entirety of the mock trading day and extends its consequences into the next live trading week. Members who inadvertently upload or modify UCC data during the restricted period risk having those records purged, potentially causing client onboarding or trading eligibility issues on Monday, March 02, 2026. The impact is limited to back-office and compliance teams rather than market participants directly, and is confined to a single non-trading Saturday.
