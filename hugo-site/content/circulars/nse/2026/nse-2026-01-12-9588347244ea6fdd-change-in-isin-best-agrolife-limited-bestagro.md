## Summary

National Stock Exchange of India has notified members about a change in the ISIN code for Best Agrolife Limited (Symbol: BESTAGRO) effective January 16, 2026. The change is due to sub-division of equity shares from a face value of Rs. 10/- per share to Re. 1/- per share. The new ISIN code INE052T01021 will be applicable for all trades executed on and from the ex-date.

## Key Points

- Company: Best Agrolife Limited
- Trading Symbol: BESTAGRO
- New ISIN Code: INE052T01021
- Reason: Sub-division of shares from Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/- face value
- Effective Date: January 16, 2026 (Ex-date)
- Circular Reference: NSE/CML/72272, Circular Ref. No: 0050/2026

## Regulatory Changes

The ISIN (International Securities Identification Number) code for Best Agrolife Limited will be changed to INE052T01021 following the corporate action of share sub-division. This administrative change reflects the reduction in face value of equity shares from Rs. 10 per share to Re. 1 per share (10:1 split ratio).

## Compliance Requirements

- All exchange members must update their systems with the new ISIN code INE052T01021 for Best Agrolife Limited
- Members must ensure all trades executed on or after January 16, 2026 use the new ISIN code
- Back-office systems and settlement processes must be updated to reflect the new identification code
- Members should communicate the change to clients holding positions in BESTAGRO

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: January 12, 2026
- **Ex-Date (Effective Date)**: January 16, 2026 - New ISIN becomes effective for all trades from this date

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with medium operational impact. The share sub-division increases the number of shares outstanding by 10 times while reducing the face value proportionately, making shares more affordable for retail investors. Members need to ensure system readiness before the ex-date to avoid trade processing issues. The change affects trading, clearing, and settlement systems that use ISIN codes for security identification. Shareholders will receive 10 shares of Re. 1 face value for every 1 share of Rs. 10 face value held.
