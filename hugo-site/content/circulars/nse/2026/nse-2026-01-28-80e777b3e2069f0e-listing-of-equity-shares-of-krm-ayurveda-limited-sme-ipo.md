## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a standard SME IPO listing with limited impact on the broader market. The listing affects only the SME segment of NSE's EMERGE platform.

**Operational Impact**: Medium for SME segment participants - Trading members dealing in SME securities need to configure systems for the new symbol, ISIN, and lot size. The Trade for Trade Surveillance Segment classification requires special attention to settlement processes.

**Investor Impact**: Relevant for SME investors and those interested in the Ayurveda/FMCG sector. The 10% face value with Rs. 135/- issue price represents a 1,250% premium, which is typical for SME IPOs but requires careful valuation consideration.
