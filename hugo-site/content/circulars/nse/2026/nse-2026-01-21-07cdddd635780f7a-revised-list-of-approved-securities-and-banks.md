## Summary

NSE has issued a revised list of approved equity securities that can be deposited as non-cash component of liquid assets for the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) segment. The circular specifies 40+ approved securities with VAR-based haircuts and quantity restrictions. Members can deposit each security subject to a maximum of 25% of total margins, with specific overall permitted quantities defined across all segments.

## Key Points

- Maximum deposit limit per security is 25% of total margins
- List includes major blue-chip stocks across banking, energy, manufacturing, technology, and consumer goods sectors
- Overall permitted quantities are specified for each security across all segments
- Securities are not available for memberwise permitted quantity in SLB segment (marked as N.A)
- The circular provides annexures with detailed security information including Symbol, ISIN, Security Name, and quantity limits

## Regulatory Changes

This is a routine revision of the approved securities list for SLB operations. The framework maintains the existing structure where:
- VAR-based haircuts apply to all listed securities

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must apply appropriate VAR-based haircuts when calculating collateral value
- Adherence to overall permitted quantity limits across all segments is mandatory
