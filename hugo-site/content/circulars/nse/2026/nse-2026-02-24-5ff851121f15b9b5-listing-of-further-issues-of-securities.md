## Important Dates

| Event | Date |

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification with moderate market impact. The addition of shares from ESOP allotments (HDFCBANK, IXIGO, LODHA) marginally increases the free float of these stocks. Preferential allotment shares for BALUFORGE and MAXESTATES are subject to lock-in periods and will not immediately impact tradeable supply. HDFC Bank's addition of 13,60,302 shares is negligible relative to its large existing share base. Smaller-cap stocks like BALUFORGE and MAXESTATES may see slightly more proportional float impact. No systemic or market-wide implications.
