title: Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) - Reference Price Methodology Change for Gold &
  Silver ETFs
---

## Summary

NSE has changed the reference price methodology for Gold & Silver Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in response to volatility in underlying Gold and Silver prices. The reference price will now be based on T-1 NAV (previous day's Net Asset Value) as published by respective Mutual Funds/Asset Management Companies, with the prescribed 20% lower price band applicable to this T-1 NAV price. This change is effective immediately from the trading session of February 01, 2026.

## Key Points

- Reference price for Gold & Silver ETFs now based on T-1 NAV published by respective Mutual Funds/AMCs
- Change implemented due to volatility in underlying Gold & Silver prices
- 20% lower price band applies to the T-1 NAV price for trading purposes
- Methodology change effective immediately for the trading session of February 01, 2026
- Supersedes previous guidance from NSE circular NSE/SURV/19758 dated January 5, 2012

## Regulatory Changes

The Exchange has modified the reference price determination methodology for Gold & Silver ETFs. Previously governed by NSE circular NSE/SURV/19758 dated January 5, 2012, the new approach uses T-1 NAV as the basis for reference pricing instead of other potential methodologies. The 20% lower price band mechanism remains in place but is now applied to the T-1 NAV price.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must note the revised reference price methodology for Gold & Silver ETFs
- Trading systems should reflect T-1 NAV-based reference prices for these ETFs
- 20% lower price band to be calculated based on T-1 NAV published by respective Mutual Funds/AMCs
- Members to direct queries to surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: February 01, 2026 (same day as circular issuance)
- **Applicability**: Trading session of February 01, 2026 onwards

## Impact Assessment

This change has immediate and significant impact on Gold & Silver ETF trading:

**Market Impact**: The shift to T-1 NAV-based reference pricing provides greater stability during periods of high volatility in underlying precious metal prices. The 20% lower price band continues to provide downside protection while allowing adequate price discovery.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants must adjust to same-day implementation of the new methodology. Price band calculations and trading systems need to reference T-1 NAV from respective AMCs.

**Investor Impact**: Traders and investors in Gold & Silver ETFs will see price bands calculated differently, potentially affecting intraday trading ranges and execution strategies during volatile market conditions.
