title: Revoke of Temporary Suspension for subscriptions in certain schemes of PGIM
  Mutual Fund on NSE MF Invest Platform
---

## Summary

NSE has revoked the temporary suspension on subscriptions for three PGIM India international fund of funds schemes effective February 6, 2026. Following SEBI's permission to accept subscriptions within available headroom under overseas investment limits, members can now process lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh SIP/STP registrations up to Rs 5,00,000 per day per PAN on the NSE MF Invest Platform.

## Key Points

- Subscription reopened for PGIM India Global Equity Opportunities Fund of Fund, PGIM India Emerging Markets Equity Fund of Fund, and PGIM India Global Select Real Estate Securities Fund of Fund
- Maximum transaction limit: Rs 5,00,000 per day, per investor, per scheme (at primary holder PAN level)
- Applies to lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh SIP/STP registrations received before cut-off time
- Based on SEBI letter no. SEBI/HO/OW/IMD-II/DoF3/P/25095/2022 dated June 17, 2022
- SEBI permitted MFs to invest in overseas funds/securities up to headroom available without breaching limits as of EOD February 1, 2022
- Previous suspension announced via Notice Cum Addendum dated December 10, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has permitted mutual funds to accept subscriptions and invest in overseas funds/securities up to the headroom available without breaching overseas investment limits that existed as of end of day February 1, 2022 at the mutual fund level. This regulatory flexibility allows AMCs to reopen international schemes that were previously suspended due to overseas investment limit concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must enable the three designated schemes on NSE MF Invest Platform with immediate effect
- Transaction processing must enforce the Rs 5,00,000 per day per PAN limit at primary holder level
- Only transactions received before cut-off time on business days should be processed
- Unit holders are requested to update PAN, KYC, email address, mobile number, and nominee details with AMC
- Unit holders should link their PAN with Aadhaar Number
- Investors advised to check for unclaimed redemptions or IDCW payments

## Important Dates

- **February 5, 2026**: PGIM India AMC issued Notice Cum Addendum announcing reopening
- **February 6, 2026**: Effective date for reopening subscriptions in designated schemes
- **February 9, 2026**: NSE circular issued to members
- **Immediate effect**: Changes implemented on NSE MF Invest Platform

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Retail investors gain renewed access to international equity exposure through fund of funds route, albeit with daily transaction limits. The Rs 5,00,000 daily cap per PAN ensures controlled inflows while managing overseas investment headroom.

**Market Operations**: The reopening provides investors seeking global diversification through emerging markets, global equity opportunities, and real estate securities access to these investment avenues. However, daily limits may require investors to stagger larger investments across multiple days.

**Distribution Impact**: Distributors and platforms can now accept fresh subscriptions and systematic plans for these international schemes, potentially increasing AUM in overseas investment category while staying within regulatory limits.
