## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to a routine preferential allotment listing for an SME company on the EMERGE platform. The lock-in period until August 16, 2026 means these shares will have restricted tradability for approximately 6.5 months post-listing. The preferential allotment represents additional capital raised by the company at a significant premium (Rs. 482 vs. Rs. 10 face value). Impact is limited to existing shareholders of Sathlokhar Synergys E&C Global Limited and potential investors in SME securities.
