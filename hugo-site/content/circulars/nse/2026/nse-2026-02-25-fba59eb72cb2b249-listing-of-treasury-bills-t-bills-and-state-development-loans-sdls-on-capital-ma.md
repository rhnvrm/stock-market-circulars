## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt market listing circular with moderate operational impact for fixed-income participants. Debt traders, bond dealers, and institutional investors active on NSE's capital market segment should note the addition of 29 new tradable instruments. The SDL coupon rates (6.54%–7.72%) reflect current state government borrowing costs and provide investors with a range of state-issued fixed-income instruments across tenors. The three T-bills cater to short-term liquidity management needs. No impact on equity markets or equity trading members.
