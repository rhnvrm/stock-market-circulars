## Summary

NSE has issued Circular Ref. No. 135/2026 under the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework, shortlisting two securities — Pavna Industries Limited (PAVNAIND) and Vardhman Polytex Limited (VARDMNPOLY) — under the Long Term ASM Stage I framework, effective February 23, 2026. A 100% margin requirement will apply on all open and new positions from February 25, 2026.

## Key Points

- Two securities shortlisted under Long Term ASM Framework Stage I w.e.f. February 23, 2026: PAVNAIND (Pavna Industries Limited, INE07S101038) and VARDMNPOLY (Vardhman Polytex Limited, INE835A01029)
- 100% margin applicable on all open positions as on February 24, 2026 and new positions from February 25, 2026 onwards
- No securities shortlisted under Stage IV, Stage I to II, Stage II to III, or Stage I to IV transitions
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Upon exit from ASM, the price band reverts to the pre-ASM applicable band, unless subject to another surveillance measure
- Shortlisting under ASM is purely a market surveillance action and should not be construed as adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

This circular references and builds upon earlier ASM framework circulars: NSE/SURV/39265 (Oct 27, 2018), NSE/SURV/45111 (Jul 22, 2020), NSE/SURV/46557 (Dec 04, 2020), NSE/SURV/48506 (Jun 04, 2021), NSE/SURV/52090 (Apr 22, 2022), NSE/SURV/63362 (Aug 09, 2024), and NSE/SURV/64066 (Sep 20, 2024). Securities qualifying under criteria VII (Stage IV) are shifted from Rolling Settlement (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE).

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must ensure 100% margin is collected on open positions in PAVNAIND and VARDMNPOLY as on February 24, 2026

## Important Dates

- **February 20, 2026**: Circular issued
- **February 23, 2026**: Effective date for inclusion of PAVNAIND and VARDMNPOLY in Long Term ASM Stage I
- **February 24, 2026**: 100% margin applicable on all open positions as of this date
- **February 25, 2026**: 100% margin applicable on all new positions created from this date onwards

## Impact Assessment

Traders and investors holding or planning positions in Pavna Industries Limited (PAVNAIND) and Vardhman Polytex Limited (VARDMNPOLY) will face significantly higher capital requirements due to the 100% margin mandate. This is likely to reduce liquidity and trading volumes in these securities. The Stage I classification indicates an early-stage surveillance flag; no securities were moved to higher stages (II, III, or IV) in this circular, limiting broader market impact to these two scrips.
