  (H1 FY2025-26)
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a reminder to all trading members to submit Action Taken Reports (ATR) addressing non-compliances reported in their internal audit reports for the half year ended September 30, 2025. The deadline for submission is January 31, 2026, through the Inspection module in the Member Portal. Failure to close observations or submit ATR by the due date will result in monetary penalties and/or disciplinary actions as per Exchange circular NSE/INSP/70746 dated October 10, 2025.

## Key Points

- Trading members must close non-compliances identified in internal audit reports
- Submission must be made through Inspection module in Member Portal in prescribed format
- Non-compliance with submission deadline will trigger monetary penalties and disciplinary actions
- Penalty framework defined in circular NSE/INSP/70746 dated October 10, 2025
