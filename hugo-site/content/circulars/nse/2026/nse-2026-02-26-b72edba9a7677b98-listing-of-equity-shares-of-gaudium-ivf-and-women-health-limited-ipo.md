## Impact Assessment

The listing adds a new healthcare sector stock to NSE's Capital Market segment. Gaudium IVF and Women Health Limited operates in the IVF and women's healthcare space, which has seen growing investor interest. The relatively small free-float at listing (shares not under lock-in: approximately 14,620,340 shares out of 72,786,884 total) may result in limited liquidity initially. Investors who participated in the IPO at Rs. 79/- per share can begin trading from February 27, 2026. The majority of promoter/anchor shares are subject to lock-in periods ranging from one month to three years, which is standard for IPO listings under SEBI regulations.
