title: 'EoDI: SEBI Mandates Disclosure of Registered Name and Registration Number
  on Social Media Platforms'
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued Circular No. HO/(79)2026-MIRSD-PODMMC dated February 26, 2026, under the Ease of Doing Investment (EoDI) initiative, requiring all SEBI-regulated entities and their agents to disclose their registered name and SEBI registration number prominently on social media platforms (SMPs). NSE has forwarded this circular to all its members via Circular Ref. No. NSE/COMP/73058 (15/2026) dated February 27, 2026.

The measure is aimed at helping investors distinguish content posted by legitimate SEBI-registered entities from content posted by unregistered or unregulated persons on social media.

## Key Points

- All SEBI-regulated entities and their agents must prominently display their SEBI registered name and registration number on the home page of their social media handles.
- Disclosure is also required at the beginning of each video or content piece related to the securities market uploaded on any social media platform.
- Platforms covered include YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Threads, Telegram, Reddit, and any other SMP — whether in closed or publicly available groups.
- This applies to both entities with single SEBI registration and those with multiple registrations.
- The requirement covers agents of regulated entities such as mutual fund distributors and distributors of portfolio management services.

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has introduced a new disclosure requirement under its EoDI initiative via Circular HO/(79)2026-MIRSD-PODMMC. This is a new obligation layered on top of existing code of conduct requirements under Section 12 of the SEBI Act, 1992, and respective intermediary regulations. The term 'persons regulated by the Board' is defined under Chapter IIIA, Explanation 1 of Regulation 16A of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Stock Brokers (SBs):** Must display registered name and SEBI registration number on social media profile pages and in securities market content.
- **Depository Participants (DPs):** Same disclosure requirements apply.
- **Registrar to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents (RTAs):** Same disclosure requirements apply.
- **Investment Advisers (IAs) and Research Analysts (RAs):** Must disclose on home page of social media handles and at the beginning of each video/content.
- **Mutual Funds/AMCs/AMFI, Portfolio Managers, AIFs, InvITs, REITs, SMREITs, CIS:** All subject to the same requirements.
- **Agents (e.g., MF distributors, PMS distributors):** Must also comply with the disclosure norms when posting securities market-related content.
- Entities with a single SEBI registration must state the registered name and registration number near the social media handle name on the profile/home page.

## Important Dates

- **SEBI Circular Date:** February 26, 2026
- **NSE Forwarding Circular Date:** February 27, 2026
- Effective date and compliance deadline: Not explicitly stated in the available circular text; entities should refer to the full SEBI circular (HO/(79)2026-MIRSD-PODMMC) for any specific timelines.

## Impact Assessment

This circular has broad applicability across the entire SEBI-regulated intermediary ecosystem. The compliance burden is moderate — primarily requiring updates to social media profile pages and modifications to content creation workflows to include disclosure overlays or disclosures at the start of videos. There is no direct impact on trading, market operations, or stock prices. However, intermediaries and agents who are active on social media must promptly audit their social media presence and implement the required disclosures to avoid regulatory action. This initiative enhances investor protection by making it easier for retail investors to verify the legitimacy of financial content creators online.
