## Summary

NSE has issued a surveillance circular placing 6 securities under Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I effective January 8-9, 2026. The affected securities will face increased margin requirements of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher, capped at 100%) on all open positions and new positions created from January 9, 2026. Additionally, 6 securities are being excluded from the ASM framework.

## Key Points

- 6 securities shortlisted for ST-ASM Stage I effective January 8, 2026
- Margin rate increases to 50% or existing margin (whichever higher), maximum capped at 100%
- Margin applies to open positions as on January 8, 2026 and new positions from January 9, 2026
- No securities in ST-ASM Stage II
- No securities moving between stages
- 6 securities excluded from ASM framework: CUBEXTUB, DYNAMIC, HINDCOPPER, MGSL, MMTC, SILVERTUC
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance, not adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

Enhanced surveillance measure implementation:
- Margin requirements increased to minimum 50% for securities under ST-ASM Stage I
- Existing margin retained if already higher than 50%
- Maximum margin capped at 100%
- Framework continues previous circulars: NSE/SURV/64066 (Oct 2018), NSE/SURV/39265 (Dec 2020), NSE/SURV/46557 (Apr 2022), NSE/SURV/52144 (Sep 2023), NSE/SURV/58558 (Sep 2024)

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must apply 50% margin (or existing margin if higher) on all trades in listed securities from January 9, 2026
- **Margin Application**: Applies to both existing open positions (as on January 8, 2026) and new positions created from January 9, 2026
- **Risk Management**: Enhanced monitoring required for positions in affected securities
- **Client Communication**: Members should inform clients about increased margin requirements

## Important Dates

- **January 7, 2026**: Circular issuance date
- **January 8, 2026**: Securities placed under ST-ASM Stage I; margin applicable on open positions as on this date
- **January 9, 2026**: Enhanced margin requirements become effective for new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Traders holding positions in the 6 affected securities will face significantly higher margin requirements, potentially requiring additional capital infusion or position reduction. The 50% minimum margin increases trading costs and may reduce liquidity in these securities.

**Market Impact**: Increased margins may lead to reduced trading volumes and wider bid-ask spreads in affected securities. Existing position holders may face margin calls.

**Positive Development**: Exclusion of 6 securities (CUBEXTUB, DYNAMIC, HINDCOPPER, MGSL, MMTC, SILVERTUC) from ASM framework indicates improved market conditions for those stocks, with margin requirements returning to normal levels.

**Surveillance Rationale**: NSE emphasizes this is a market surveillance measure, not punitive action against companies. The framework aims to curb excessive speculation and ensure orderly trading.
