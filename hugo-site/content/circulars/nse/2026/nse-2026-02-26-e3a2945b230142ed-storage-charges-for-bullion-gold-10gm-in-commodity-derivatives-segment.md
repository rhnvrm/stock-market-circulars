---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued a circular specifying the storage charges applicable for Gold 10gm contracts in the Commodity Derivatives Segment. This follows earlier circulars on clearing, settlement, and risk management procedures for Gold 10gm futures (NCL/COM/72967, dated February 25, 2026) and storage charges for Base Metals and Bullion (NCL/COM/72862, dated February 18, 2026).

## Key Points

- Storage charge for Gold 10gm is Rs. 0.25 per 10gm coin/bar per day
- Transaction charges of Rs. 350 per deposit transaction are payable directly to the vault
- Window delivery charges are Rs. 350 per transaction
- In-city (door) delivery freight: Rs. 10/kg with a minimum of Rs. 1,500; Rs. 30/kg additional for quantities over 10 kg
- GST and any applicable government levies (duty/tax) will be added to the above charges

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This circular supplements the existing clearing and settlement procedures for Gold 10gm futures by providing the specific storage and ancillary fee schedule applicable at the vault level.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members dealing in Gold 10gm futures in the Commodity Derivatives Segment must note and communicate the applicable storage and vault charges to their clients
- All vault-related charges (transaction, window delivery, freight, GST) are payable directly to the vault by the member or client as applicable

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: February 26, 2026
- Reference Circular (Clearing & Settlement Procedures): February 25, 2026 (NCL/COM/72967)
- Reference Circular (Storage Charges – Base Metals & Bullion): February 18, 2026 (NCL/COM/72862)

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a low market impact as it is an operational/administrative update specifying fee schedules for physical delivery of Gold 10gm contracts. It affects members and clients with physical settlement obligations in the Commodity Derivatives Segment. The charges are modest and consistent with standard vault and logistics pricing. No trading restrictions or significant compliance burdens are introduced.
