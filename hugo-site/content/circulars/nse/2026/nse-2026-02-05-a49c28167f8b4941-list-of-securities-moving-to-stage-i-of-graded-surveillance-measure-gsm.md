## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** The 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for traders, reducing leverage and potentially lowering trading volumes. The 5% price band limits intraday volatility.

**Market Impact:** GSM placement signals heightened regulatory concern about the security, typically due to unusual price movements, low liquidity, or corporate governance issues. This may deter retail participation and impact liquidity.

**Investor Protection:** These measures aim to protect investors from excessive speculation and volatility while allowing continued trading under controlled conditions. Progressive stages ensure proportionate response to market concerns.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers must update risk management systems to enforce margin and price band restrictions, and communicate changes to clients holding or trading the affected security.
