---

## Summary

NSE will conduct a mock trading session on Saturday, February 07, 2026, across multiple segments (Equity, F&O, Currency Derivatives, Commodity Derivatives, and SLB). As a result, the Unique Client Code (UCC) live environment will be unavailable from 10 AM until midnight on February 07, 2026. Members are advised to refrain from making any UCC modifications or uploads during this period.

## Key Points

- Mock trading session scheduled for Saturday, February 07, 2026
- UCC live environment will be unavailable from 10 AM to midnight on February 07, 2026
- Any UCC records added or modified during the unavailability period will be purged by end of day
- UCC changes made during mock trading will not be valid for live trading from Monday, February 09, 2026 onwards
- Members must avoid UCC modifications/uploads during the specified timeframe
- This circular references multiple segment-specific circulars: NSE/CMTR/72667, NSE/FAOP/72658, NSE/CD/72660, NSE/COM/72666, and NSE/SLBS/72665

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a temporary operational measure for conducting mock trading.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must refrain from making any UCC modifications or uploads between 10 AM and midnight on Saturday, February 07, 2026
- Members should plan UCC-related activities before 10 AM on February 07, 2026, or after midnight on the same day
- Members need to ensure any critical UCC updates are completed before the blackout period begins

## Important Dates

- **February 06, 2026**: Circular issued
- **February 07, 2026**: Mock trading session; UCC system unavailable from 10 AM to midnight
- **February 07, 2026**: End of day - UCC records added/modified during blackout period will be purged
- **February 09, 2026**: Live trading resumes on Monday

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Members cannot add new clients or modify existing client codes during the 14-hour UCC blackout period on February 07, 2026. This may affect member firms planning to onboard new clients or update client information over the weekend.

**Market Impact**: Low - Mock trading does not affect live market operations. Regular trading will resume on Monday, February 09, 2026.

**Member Action Required**: Members need to plan their UCC-related activities around the blackout period and communicate internally to avoid data loss from purged records.
