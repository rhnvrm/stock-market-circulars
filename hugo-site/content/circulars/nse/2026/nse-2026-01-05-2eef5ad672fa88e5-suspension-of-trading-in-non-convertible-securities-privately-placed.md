## Summary

NSE has announced the suspension of trading in non-convertible securities (privately placed) of two entities effective January 6, 2026. The suspension is pursuant to Regulation 3.1.2 of the National Stock Exchange Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A and is due to the redemption of the securities.

## Key Points

- Two non-convertible securities will be suspended from trading
- Bank of Baroda NCD with ISIN INE705A08078 suspended from January 6, 2026
- Toyota Financial Services India Limited NCD with ISIN INE692Q07456 suspended from January 6, 2026
- Reason for suspension: Redemption of securities
- Action taken under Regulation 3.1.2 of NSE Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine operational action under existing regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members should note the suspension of trading in the specified ISINs from the effective date
- No trading will be permitted in these securities from January 6, 2026 onwards
- Members should update their systems to reflect the suspension status

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** January 5, 2026
- **Suspension Effective Date:** January 6, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and traders of these specific non-convertible debt securities. This is a routine administrative action following the redemption of debt instruments. No broader market implications are expected as these are privately placed securities with limited trading activity. The suspension ensures orderly settlement of redeemed securities and prevents inadvertent trading in instruments that have matured.
