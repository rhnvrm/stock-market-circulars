title: Change in Scheme Name of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund on NSE MF Invest Platform
---

## Summary

ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund has changed the names of two schemes on the NSE MF Invest platform effective January 31, 2026. The changes are purely administrative rebranding with no modifications to investment objectives or scheme operations. SEBI provided no-objection for these changes on December 22, 2025.

## Key Points

- ICICI Prudential Silver ETF Fund of Fund renamed to ICICI Prudential Silver ETF FOF
- ICICI Prudential Regular Gold Savings Fund (FOF) renamed to ICICI Prudential Gold ETF FOF
- Changes are effective from January 31, 2026
- SEBI approved the name changes on December 22, 2025
- Investment objectives and scheme operations remain unchanged
- Minor modification to ICICI Prudential Gold ETF's investment objective description (removal of reference to LBMA AM fixing prices)

## Regulatory Changes

No substantive regulatory changes. The modifications represent administrative rebranding of existing schemes. For ICICI Prudential Gold ETF, the investment objective was simplified to remove specific reference to "LBMA AM fixing prices" while maintaining the core objective of tracking domestic gold prices.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance actions required from members or investors. This is an informational circular regarding scheme name changes. Members should update their systems to reflect the new scheme names effective January 31, 2026.

## Important Dates

- **January 30, 2026**: Effective date - changes take effect from closure of business hours
- **January 31, 2026**: New scheme names become active on NSE MF Invest platform
- **December 22, 2025**: SEBI communicated no-objection for the changes

## Impact Assessment

Minimal impact. This is an administrative name change affecting two mutual fund schemes. There are no changes to investment strategies, objectives, or operations. Investors in these schemes will see updated names on their statements but experience no material changes to their investments. The simplification of the Gold ETF's investment objective description provides clearer communication without altering the fund's actual tracking methodology.
