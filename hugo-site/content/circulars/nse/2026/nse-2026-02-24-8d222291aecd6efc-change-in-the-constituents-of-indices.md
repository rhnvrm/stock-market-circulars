## Impact Assessment

This rebalancing has significant market impact across multiple fronts:

- **Passive Funds & ETFs:** Index funds and ETFs tracking Nifty Next 50, Nifty Midcap Select, and Nifty Financial Services must rebalance, leading to large buy/sell volumes in affected stocks near the effective date.
- **Stocks being excluded** (e.g., BAJAJHFL, HAVELLS, COFORGE, GODREJPROP, ICICIPRULI) may face selling pressure as passive funds reduce holdings.
- **Stocks being included** (e.g., TATACAP, SWIGGY, PAYTM, MFSL, AUBANK) may see buying demand from passive fund rebalancing.
- **Notable cross-index moves:** CUMMINSIND and MUTHOOTFIN move from Nifty Midcap Select to Nifty Next 50; HDFCAMC and UNIONBANK similarly graduate; NAUKRI and LICI move from Nifty Next 50 to Nifty Midcap Select.
- **Derivatives market:** Index futures and options contracts on these indices may see increased volatility and open interest adjustments around the rebalancing window.
