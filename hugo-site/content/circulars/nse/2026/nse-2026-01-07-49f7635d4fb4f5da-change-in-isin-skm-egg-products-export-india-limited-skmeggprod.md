## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Share sub-division typically increases liquidity by reducing per-share price, making the stock more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Exchange members and market participants need to update their systems, databases, and settlement processes to accommodate the new ISIN. The 5-day notice period provides adequate time for system updates.

**Trading Impact:** Shareholders will hold double the number of shares at half the face value post sub-division. The total investment value remains unchanged, but the increased number of shares may enhance trading activity.
