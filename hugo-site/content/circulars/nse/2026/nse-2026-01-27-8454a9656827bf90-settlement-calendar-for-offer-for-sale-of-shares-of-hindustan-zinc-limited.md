Market members, custodians, and PCMs dealing with this specific OFS must ensure operational readiness for the specified settlement timings and margin requirements. The staggered settlement structure with different margin categories allows flexibility for different investor types while maintaining settlement discipline. Non-compliance with custodial confirmation timings could result in settlement failures.
