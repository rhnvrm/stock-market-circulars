title: Revised List of Securities for SLBS - March 2026
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited (NCL) has issued the revised list of securities eligible for transactions under the Securities Lending & Borrowing Scheme (SLBS) for the month of March 2026. This circular (Ref. No. 022/2026) is addressed to all Participants and Custodians and is issued in reference to SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/18/2013 dated May 30, 2013, and NCL's consolidated circular NCL/CMPT/67763 dated April 30, 2025.

## Key Points

- The revised list (Annexure-I) contains all securities approved for SLBS transactions in **March 2026**.
- The list is effective for the month of March 2026 replacing the previously applicable list.
- All Participants and Custodians must refer to Annexure-I to identify eligible securities for lending and borrowing operations.
- The list includes a wide array of equities and ETFs spanning multiple sectors, including banking, pharma, energy, FMCG, and infrastructure.
- Notable securities in the list include ADANIENT, ANGELONE, AXISBANK, BAJFINANCE, BAJAJ-AUTO, BEL, BHARTIARTL, BHEL, BIOCON, BOSCHLTD, BPCL, BRITANNIA, BSE, CANBK, and many more.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework has been introduced. This circular is a routine monthly revision under the existing SLBS framework established by SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/18/2013 and consolidated by NCL circular NCL/CMPT/67763 dated April 30, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Participants and Custodians** must update their internal systems to reflect the revised list of SLBS-eligible securities for March 2026.
- Only securities listed in Annexure-I are permitted for lending and borrowing transactions under SLBS during March 2026.
- Participants should ensure no transactions are executed in securities not included in the revised list.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** February 25, 2026
- **Effective Period:** March 2026
- **Reference Circular:** SEBI CIR/MRD/DP/18/2013 dated May 30, 2013
- **Consolidated Circular:** NCL/CMPT/67763 dated April 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This is a standard monthly administrative update with moderate operational impact. Participants and custodians must refresh their eligible securities lists for SLBS operations effective March 2026. The inclusion or exclusion of specific securities compared to the previous month may affect the availability of lending/borrowing opportunities for those instruments. No systemic or policy-level impact is expected. Entities with automated SLBS workflows should ensure timely synchronization with the updated Annexure-I list.
