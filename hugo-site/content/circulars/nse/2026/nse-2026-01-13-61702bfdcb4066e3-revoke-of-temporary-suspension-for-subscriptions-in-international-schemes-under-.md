- Applies to fresh purchase, additional purchase, and systematic transactions (SIP, STP)
- Effective immediately on NSE MF Invest Platform
- AMC reserves the right to modify subscription limits in future

- **Effective Date**: January 12, 2026 (as per AMC addendum) / January 13, 2026 (NSE implementation)
- **Platform**: NSE MF Invest Platform

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational update reversing a previous temporary suspension on fresh subscriptions in these international schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must take note of the re-enablement of subscriptions for these schemes

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a operational update specific to mutual fund subscriptions on NSE's platform.

**Investor Impact**: Moderate for affected investors - Investors who were previously unable to subscribe to these international schemes can now do so, subject to the daily limit of ₹1 crore per PAN.

**Operational Impact**: The re-enablement provides investors renewed access to international equity exposure through these schemes, though with daily subscription caps to manage fund flows and overseas investment limits.
