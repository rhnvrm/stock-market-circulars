## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. The circular is issued in pursuance of existing regulations:
- Regulation 3.1.1 of NSE (Capital Market) Trading Regulations Part A for admission of securities
- Regulation 2.5.5 of NSE (Capital Market) Trading Regulations Part A for lot size specification
- SEBI circulars CIR/MRD/DP/21/2012 (August 2, 2012) and CIR/MRD/DP/24/2012 (September 11, 2012) regarding temporary ISIN activation for additional issues

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use designated security codes (INDIASHLTR for India Shelter, MINDSPACE for Mindspace REIT)

## Important Dates

- Effective date for trading: January 14, 2026

- Mindspace REIT allotment date: January 9, 2026
- Mindspace REIT lock-in expiry dates: Ranges from January 15, 2027 to January 15, 2029 (22 separate tranches with alternating 1-year and 3-year lock-ins)

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact expected. The India Shelter ESOP allotment represents a small quantity (13,120 shares) with no lock-in restrictions, indicating routine employee compensation. The Mindspace REIT preferential allotment of 39.16 million units at Rs. 464.64 totals approximately Rs. 18,200 crore in value, but with extensive lock-in periods (1-3 years) limiting immediate tradability. The staggered lock-in structure across 22 tranches suggests strategic investor participation with long-term commitment. No immediate liquidity impact anticipated as locked-in units cannot be traded until respective expiry dates.
