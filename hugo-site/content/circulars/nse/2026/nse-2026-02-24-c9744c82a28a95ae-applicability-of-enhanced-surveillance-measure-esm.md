title: Applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - February 2026
---

## Summary

NSE's Surveillance department (Circular Ref. No. 146/2026) has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework. Two securities — SANGINITA (Sanginita Chemicals Limited) and WANBURY (Wanbury Limited) — are newly included under ESM Stage I. HOACFOODS (Hoac Foods India Limited) is being escalated from Stage I to Stage II. No securities are being removed from the ESM framework in this update.

## Key Points

- **New ESM Stage I inclusions (w.e.f. February 25, 2026):** SANGINITA (INE753W01010), WANBURY (INE107F01022)
- **ESM Stage I → Stage II upgrade (w.e.f. February 25, 2026):** HOACFOODS (Hoac Foods India Limited, INE0S6S01017)
- **ESM Stage II → Stage I downgrade:** None (Nil)
- **Exclusions from ESM framework:** None (Nil)
- All newly included/upgraded securities will attract a **minimum 100% margin** on open positions as of February 25, 2026, and on new positions from February 26, 2026
- Securities shift from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to **Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST)** w.e.f. February 26, 2026
- Stage II securities will trade under **Trade-for-Trade with a 2% price band** under Periodic Call Auction w.e.f. February 25, 2026
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

This circular references and builds upon prior ESM circulars: NSE/SURV/56948 (June 2, 2023), NSE/SURV/57609 (July 18, 2023), NSE/SURV/63361 (August 9, 2024), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), NSE/SURV/64400 (October 4, 2024), and NSE/SURV/69315 (July 25, 2025). The updated consolidated ESM list includes securities such as CBAZAAR (Net Avenue Technologies Limited, INE518X01015, Stage II) and CURAA (Cura Technologies, Stage information partially available).

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members:** Must ensure 100% margin collection on all open and new positions in ESM-listed securities from the effective dates
- **Members** must note the reclassification of affected securities from EQ/SM series to BE/ST series and update trading systems accordingly
- Stage II securities must be traded under Periodic Call Auction with a 2% price band
- Members are advised that ESM shortlisting is a market surveillance action and should not be treated as an adverse regulatory action against the listed company

## Important Dates

- **February 24, 2026:** Circular issued
- **February 25, 2026:** ESM Stage I/II reclassifications effective; Stage II Periodic Call Auction (2% price band) begins; 100% margin applicable on existing open positions
- **February 26, 2026:** Shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade (BE/ST) effective; 100% margin on all new positions

## Impact Assessment

Traders and investors holding positions in SANGINITA, WANBURY, or HOACFOODS face significant trading restrictions. The mandatory 100% margin requirement effectively doubles capital requirements for leveraged positions, likely reducing liquidity in these counters. The move to Trade-for-Trade eliminates netting benefits and requires full delivery on every trade, further constraining trading activity. HOACFOODS faces the most restrictive conditions as a Stage II security, being subject to a 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction — sharply limiting daily price movement and trading flexibility. These measures are consistent with NSE's ongoing surveillance framework to protect market integrity in securities exhibiting abnormal price or volume behaviour.
