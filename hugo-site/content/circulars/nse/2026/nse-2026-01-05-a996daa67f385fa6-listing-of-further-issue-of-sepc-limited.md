## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative listing notification with minimal market impact. The conversion of partly paid-up shares to fully paid-up shares is a corporate action that increases the free float of fully paid-up shares by 19,13,791 units across three distinctive number ranges. The shares rank pari passu with existing equity shares and have no lock-in restrictions, making them immediately available for trading. The market lot of 1 share provides liquidity for retail investors. Overall impact is low as this represents completion of payment on existing securities rather than fresh capital raising.
