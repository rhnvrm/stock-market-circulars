## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements Stage IV surveillance measures under the GSM framework, continuing from previous circulars NSE/SURV/34262 (February 23, 2017), NSE/SURV/38389 (July 20, 2018), NSE/SURV/42790 (November 29, 2019), NSE/SURV/59425 (November 17, 2023), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), and NSE/SURV/71670 (December 5, 2025).

The GSM framework has four progressive stages:
- **Stage I**: 100% margin and 5% or lower price band
- **Stage II**: Trade-for-trade with 5% price band and 50% ASD from buyers
- **Stage III**: Trade-for-trade with 5% price band, weekly trading, and 100% ASD from buyers
- **Stage IV**: Trade-for-trade with 5% price band, weekly trading, 100% ASD from buyers, and no upward movement

## Compliance Requirements

**For Members:**
- Exercise adequate precaution while trading in GAYAPROJ
- Ensure settlement is done on trade-to-trade basis only
- No netting off of positions allowed
- Collect 100% of trade value as ASD from buyers before executing trades
- Restrict trading to Mondays or the first trading day of each week
- Enforce 5% or lower price band restrictions
- Prevent any upward price movement in the security

**For Buyers:**

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: January 6, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 7, 2026
- **Trading Frequency**: Once per week (every Monday or first trading day of the week)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Severe liquidity constraints due to weekly-only trading window
- Complete elimination of upward price momentum
- Significantly reduced investor participation due to 100% ASD requirement
- Trade-for-trade settlement prevents position netting and increases capital requirements

**Investor Impact:**
- Existing shareholders face extremely limited exit opportunities
- New buyers must commit 100% additional capital as deposit
- Price discovery severely hampered by weekly trading and no upward movement
- Investment becomes highly illiquid with restricted tradability

**Operational Impact:**
- Members must implement strict controls to enforce Stage IV restrictions
- Enhanced monitoring required for trade execution and settlement
- Increased risk of settlement failures due to restrictive conditions

**Risk Considerations:**
Stage IV GSM placement indicates serious concerns about the security's trading behavior, volatility, or compliance issues. Investors should exercise extreme caution and thoroughly assess risks before trading in this security.
