## Compliance Requirements

- **Members/Brokers**: Must ensure no new trades are executed in the five listed ISINs on or after March 2, 2026.
- **Investors/Holders**: Should prepare for redemption proceeds as per the terms of the respective securities; no further secondary market trading will be possible post-suspension.

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to existing holders of these five specific debt instruments. As the suspensions are due to redemption, investors will receive their principal back as per the original terms of the securities. There is no adverse credit or default event involved. The broader NSE Debt Market operations remain unaffected. Institutions such as IRFC, BPCL, and Exim Bank that issued these instruments may have new issuances in the market separately.
