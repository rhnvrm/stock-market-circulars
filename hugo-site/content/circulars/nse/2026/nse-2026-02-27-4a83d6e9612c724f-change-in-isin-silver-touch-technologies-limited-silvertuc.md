## Impact Assessment

This is a standard corporate action-driven ISIN change resulting from a share sub-division. The number of shares held by investors will increase proportionally (5x, given the face value ratio of 10:2), while the per-share price adjusts accordingly. Members and market participants must ensure their systems, back-office processes, and client records are updated before the ex-date to avoid settlement discrepancies. The impact is moderate, primarily operational, affecting brokers, depositories, and institutional investors holding SILVERTUC shares.
