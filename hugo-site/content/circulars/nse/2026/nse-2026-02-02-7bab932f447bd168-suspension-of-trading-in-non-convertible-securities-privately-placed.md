## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This affects a single privately placed debt security of one company. Privately placed securities typically have limited secondary market trading activity.

**Investor Impact**: Low. The suspension is due to redemption, meaning investors will receive their principal back as per the terms of the instrument. This is a normal lifecycle event for debt securities.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal operational adjustments required by trading members to update their systems and prevent trading in the suspended ISIN.
