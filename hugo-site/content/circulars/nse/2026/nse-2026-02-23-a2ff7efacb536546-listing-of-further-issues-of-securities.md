**Market Impact:** Minimal. These are routine ESOP allotments resulting in marginal dilution for each company. All shares are pari passu with no lock-in, making them immediately tradeable. Bajaj Finserv's allotment of ~2.7 million shares is the largest in absolute terms but remains small relative to its total share capital.
