## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to the launch of a new mutual fund scheme. The impact is limited to:

- Investors seeking Shariah-compliant equity investment options with exposure to Nifty500 Shariah Index
- NSE members and distributors offering mutual fund products on the NSE MF Invest Platform
- UTI Mutual Fund's product portfolio expansion

The NFO provides an additional investment avenue for investors preferring Shariah-compliant index-based equity investments but does not affect existing market operations or trading activities.
