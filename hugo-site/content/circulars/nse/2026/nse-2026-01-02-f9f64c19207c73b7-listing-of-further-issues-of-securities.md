No regulatory changes. This is a routine notification under Regulation 3.1.1 and 2.5.5 of NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A for admitting further securities to trading.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must identify securities only by designated codes
- Trading must be conducted in specified lot sizes (1 share for all listed securities)
- Camlin Fine Sciences preferential issue shares subject to lock-in until July 4, 2026
- ESOP allotments have no lock-in restrictions (marked as "Not Applicable")

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: January 2, 2026
- **Effective Date**: January 5, 2026
- **Allotment Dates**: Range from October 29, 2025 to December 30, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry** (Camlin Fine Sciences only): July 4, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. The further issues represent routine ESOP allotments and one preferential issue, with share quantities being relatively small compared to the companies' existing paid-up capital. The staggered allotment dates from October to December 2025 indicate these are regular employee compensation and capital-raising activities. Only Camlin Fine Sciences' preferential issue involves a lock-in period, preventing immediate sale until July 2026. All shares are pari passu with existing equity, maintaining equal rights for all shareholders.
