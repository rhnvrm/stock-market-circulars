## Impact Assessment

The introduction of Gold 10 grams Futures provides a smaller-denomination gold futures contract compared to standard offerings, potentially improving accessibility for retail participants and smaller traders in the commodity derivatives market. The new contract expands NSE's commodity product suite and aligns with broader market development goals. Members dealing in commodity derivatives should update their systems and risk frameworks to accommodate the new contract. Clearing and settlement specifics will follow from NSE Clearing Ltd., so members should monitor for that subsequent circular.
