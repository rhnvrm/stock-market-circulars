title: Extension for Upload of Client Records to KRAs for Validations
---

## Summary

NSE has extended the deadline for Trading Members to upload client KYC records to KRAs (KYC Registration Agencies) to April 03, 2026. This extension follows widespread non-compliance with SEBI's revised 3-day upload timeline mandated in October 2023. After the extended deadline, clients without "KYC Registered" or "KYC Validated" status will not be permitted to trade or square off open positions.

## Key Points

- SEBI revised KYC upload timeline from 10 working days to 3 working days effective October 12, 2023
- Sample comparison revealed several Trading Members have not complied with the 3-day timeline
- Only clients with "KYC Registered" or "KYC Validated" KRA status are permitted to trade
- Previous deadline from circular NSE/ISC/71986 dated December 24, 2025 has been extended
- Non-compliant PANs will be restricted from trading and squaring off open positions after April 03, 2026
- Members must closely monitor open positions of such clients

## Regulatory Changes

The circular references the evolution of KYC upload timelines:

- **Original requirement**: SEBI Circular MIRSD/Cir-26/2011 (December 23, 2011) mandated 10 working days for KYC upload and document dispatch
- **Revised timeline**: SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/SECFATF/P/CIR/2023/169 (October 12, 2023) reduced timeline to 3 working days from completion of KYC process
- **Trading permission**: SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/FATF/P/CIR/2023/0144 (August 11, 2023) allows clients to transact upon KYC completion, but unverified clients cannot transact further until verification is completed

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**

1. Upload all pending client KYC records to KRAs by April 03, 2026
2. Ensure compliance with 3-day KYC upload timeline for new clients going forward
3. Verify KRA status of client PANs with respective KRAs
4. Closely monitor open positions of clients with non-validated KRA status
5. Take appropriate measures to ensure compliance before the deadline
6. Contact respective KRAs directly for queries or issues related to client KRA status

**Client Requirements:**

- Must have KRA status of "KYC Registered" or "KYC Validated" to trade
- Clients with unverified KYC attributes cannot transact until verification is completed

## Important Dates

- **January 30, 2026**: Circular issue date
- **April 03, 2026**: Extended compliance deadline for uploading client records to KRAs
- **After April 03, 2026**: Non-compliant PANs will be restricted from trading and squaring off open positions

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:**

- Trading Members with significant backlogs of unuploaded KYC records face substantial operational workload to meet the April 03, 2026 deadline
- Members must implement processes to ensure ongoing 3-day compliance for new clients
- Resource allocation required for reviewing and monitoring client KRA status

**Client Impact:**

- Clients whose KYC records are not uploaded by the deadline will face trading restrictions
- Clients with open positions may be unable to square off if their KRA status is not validated
- Potential inconvenience to investors due to trading restrictions

**Market Impact:**

- Ensures seamless interoperability across market participants
- Strengthens compliance with SEBI's KYC framework and risk management requirements
- Maintains integrity of client verification process across the securities market
