title: Connectivity - POP Network Changes - Extension for Self-Service Links
---

## Summary

NSE has extended the migration deadline for self-service connectivity links from Sify's existing Kohinoor POP location in Mumbai to new POP locations (Kurla and Parle). The revised deadline is now March 15, 2026 (extended from February 7, 2026). Members who have subscribed to self-service links from the existing POP must complete migration to ensure continued connectivity to the Exchange for trading. The extension was granted due to little progress on self-service link migrations and based on member representations.

## Key Points

- Migration deadline extended from February 7, 2026 to March 15, 2026 for self-service links only
- Extension applies to Sify POP migration from Kohinoor (Mumbai) to new locations: Kurla and Parle
- Little progress has been made on self-service link migrations according to Telecom Network Integrator (TNI)
- Extension granted based on member representations for self-service links
- Old POP will be discontinued by TNI after March 15, 2026
- Members must complete migration to maintain trading connectivity
- Managed service links were not mentioned in this extension (presumed already migrated)
- Contact details and escalation matrix for Sify provided in circular annexure

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational infrastructure update with extended compliance timeline for existing connectivity requirements previously announced in circulars NSE/MSD/69495 (August 5, 2025) and NSE/MSD/71183 (November 7, 2025).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members using self-service connectivity links from Sify's existing Kohinoor POP (Mumbai) must migrate to new POP locations (Kurla or Parle) by end of day March 15, 2026
- Members must coordinate with Sify TNI to complete the migration process
- Members should use the provided escalation matrix for migration support:
  - NOC escalation for post-commissioning issues (managed services)
  - Onsite team escalation for new application requests before commissioning
- Members must ensure migration completion to avoid loss of Exchange connectivity for trading

## Important Dates

- **February 6, 2026**: Circular issued announcing extension
- **March 15, 2026**: Revised deadline for completing self-service link migration (EOD)
- **After March 15, 2026**: Existing Kohinoor POP will be discontinued by Sify TNI
- **August 5, 2025**: Original announcement of POP migration (NSE/MSD/69495)
- **November 7, 2025**: Previous circular on migration timelines (NSE/MSD/71183)
- **February 7, 2026**: Original discontinuation date (now extended)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: High. Members who fail to migrate self-service links by March 15, 2026 will lose connectivity to NSE Exchange, directly impacting their ability to execute trades. This is a critical infrastructure change affecting trading operations.

**Affected Parties**: Trading members specifically using self-service connectivity model from Sify's Kohinoor POP in Mumbai. Members with managed service links appear to have already completed migration or are on different timelines.

**Migration Urgency**: The extension indicates slow adoption, but the hard deadline of March 15, 2026 requires immediate action from affected members to avoid trading disruptions.

**Support Resources**: Comprehensive escalation matrix provided with contact details for Sify NOC (Network Operations Center) and onsite teams at multiple levels, ensuring members have support channels for migration assistance.

**Risk**: Members who delay migration risk complete loss of trading connectivity after the March 15 deadline with no further extensions indicated.
