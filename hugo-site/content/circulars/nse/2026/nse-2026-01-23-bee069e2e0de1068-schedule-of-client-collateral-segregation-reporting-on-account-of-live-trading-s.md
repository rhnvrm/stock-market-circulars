  Session on Sunday, February 01, 2026 - Presentation of Union Budget
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued a modified schedule for client collateral segregation reporting due to a special live trading session scheduled for Sunday, February 01, 2026, on account of the Union Budget presentation. The circular provides adjusted cut-off dates for collateral reporting to accommodate the extraordinary trading day.

## Key Points

- Special live trading session scheduled for Sunday, February 01, 2026 due to Union Budget presentation
- Modified client collateral segregation reporting schedule issued for members and custodians
- Non-submission of client collateral will be treated as non-compliance
- Penalties for non-submission will be applicable for specified trade dates
- All members must adhere to the revised timelines

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a temporary operational adjustment to accommodate the special trading session on Sunday, February 01, 2026.

## Compliance Requirements

**All Members and Custodians must comply with the following revised reporting schedule:**

| Reporting for Trade Date | Cut Off Date |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| 30-Jan-26* | 02-Feb-26 |
| 31-Jan-26 | 02-Feb-26 |
| 01-Feb-26* | 02-Feb-26 |
| 02-Feb-26* | 03-Feb-26 |

*Trade dates marked with asterisk: Non-submission of client collateral shall be treated as non-compliance and penalty for non-submission shall be applicable.

## Important Dates

- **January 23, 2026**: Circular issued (Ref: NCL/CMPL/72452, Circular 02/2026)
- **January 30, 2026**: Trade date with collateral reporting due February 02, 2026 (penalty applicable)
- **January 31, 2026**: Trade date with collateral reporting due February 02, 2026
- **February 01, 2026**: Special live trading session (Sunday) - Union Budget presentation; collateral reporting due February 02, 2026 (penalty applicable)
- **February 02, 2026**: Trade date with collateral reporting due February 03, 2026 (penalty applicable)
- **February 02, 2026**: Cut-off date for three consecutive trade dates (30-Jan, 31-Jan, 01-Feb)
- **February 03, 2026**: Cut-off date for February 02 trade date

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Members and custodians must adjust their client collateral segregation reporting processes to accommodate the compressed timeline, with multiple trade dates (January 30, 31, and February 01) all having the same cut-off date of February 02, 2026.

**Compliance Risk**: High importance for members to note the penalty provisions for three specific trade dates (marked with asterisks). Non-compliance will result in penalties.

**Market Impact**: Limited to operational processes. The special Sunday trading session creates administrative adjustments but does not affect trading rules or market structure.

**Member Actions Required**: Trading members and custodians must ensure internal systems and processes can handle the accelerated reporting schedule and consolidated cut-off dates to avoid penalties.
