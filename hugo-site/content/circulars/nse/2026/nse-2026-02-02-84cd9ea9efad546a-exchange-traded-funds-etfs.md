title: Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) - Reference Price Update for Gold & Silver ETFs
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the reference price methodology for Gold & Silver ETFs traded on the exchange due to volatility in underlying commodity prices. Effective February 03, 2026, the reference price will be based on T-1 NAV published on the AMFI website. For ETFs where T-1 NAV is unavailable, the closing price of February 02, 2026 will be used as reference. The prescribed price band of +/- 20% will apply to this reference price.

## Key Points

- Reference price for Gold & Silver ETFs will be based on T-1 NAV from AMFI website
- For ETFs without T-1 NAV on AMFI website (as of Feb 02, 2026), closing price of February 02, 2026 will be used
- Price band of +/- 20% applicable to the T-1 NAV/closing price
- Change driven by volatility in underlying Gold & Silver prices
- Replaces previous methodology outlined in earlier circulars

## Regulatory Changes

NSE has modified the reference price determination methodology for Gold & Silver ETFs. Previously referenced circulars NSE/SURV/19758 (January 05, 2012), NSE/SURV/72554 (February 01, 2026), and NSE/SURV/72566 (February 01, 2026) are superseded by this updated approach specifically for precious metal ETFs.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must use the new reference price methodology for Gold & Silver ETF trading
- Reference price determination must follow T-1 NAV from AMFI website as primary source
- Apply +/- 20% price band to the determined reference price
- Members should direct queries to surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: February 02, 2026
- **Effective Date**: February 03, 2026 (next trading session)
- **Reference Date for Closing Price (if T-1 NAV unavailable)**: February 02, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - This change directly affects price discovery and trading bands for all Gold & Silver ETFs on NSE. The shift to T-1 NAV-based reference pricing provides more stability during volatile commodity price movements.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must immediately update their systems to incorporate the new reference price methodology. The change is effective for the very next trading session, requiring swift operational adjustments.

**Investor Impact**: The +/- 20% price band based on T-1 NAV may provide better alignment with underlying asset values and reduce excessive intraday volatility in ETF prices during periods of high commodity price fluctuation.
