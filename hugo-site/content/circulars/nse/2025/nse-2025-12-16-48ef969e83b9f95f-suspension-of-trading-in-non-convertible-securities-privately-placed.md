## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: December 16, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this circular is limited and routine in nature. The suspension affects only one privately placed debt security of IDBI Bank Limited, which has reached its redemption date. Privately placed securities typically have limited secondary market trading activity, so the market impact is minimal. This is a standard administrative action that occurs when debt securities mature and are redeemed. Investors holding these securities will receive their redemption proceeds as per the terms of issuance. No broader market implications are expected from this suspension.
