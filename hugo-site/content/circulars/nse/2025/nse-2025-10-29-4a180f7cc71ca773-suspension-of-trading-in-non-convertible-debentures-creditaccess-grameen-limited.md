## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements existing NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A, Regulation 3.1.2, which governs the suspension of securities from trading on the exchange.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must note the suspension of these two NCD series
- Trading in the specified NCDs (960CAGL25 and CAGL25A) must cease from the effective date
- No specific action required from CreditAccess Grameen Limited beyond standard maturity procedures
- Clearing and settlement of any outstanding trades in these securities must be completed as per standard settlement cycles before the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **October 29, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **October 31, 2025**: Effective date of trading suspension for both NCD series

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine administrative action following the natural maturity of debt instruments. The suspension affects only the specific NCD holders and does not impact the company's equity shares or other listed securities.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to holders of these specific NCDs who will receive their principal and final interest payments as per the original terms. No secondary market trading will be available after October 31, 2025.

**Operational Impact**: Standard operational procedure for exchange members. The suspension removes liquidity for these instruments, but this is expected behavior at maturity. CreditAccess Grameen Limited will process redemptions through normal maturity procedures with registrars and transfer agents.
