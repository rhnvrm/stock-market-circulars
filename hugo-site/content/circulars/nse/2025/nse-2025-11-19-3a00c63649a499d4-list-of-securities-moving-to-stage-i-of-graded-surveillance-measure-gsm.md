## Summary

NSE has placed LCC Infotech Limited (Symbol: LCCINFOTEC, ISIN: INE938A01021) under Stage I of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective November 20, 2025. This surveillance action imposes strict trading conditions including 100% margin requirement, 5% price band, and trade-to-trade settlement without netting off.

## Key Points

- LCC Infotech Limited (LCCINFOTEC) moved to Stage I of GSM framework

- Applicable margin rate: 100% of trade value
- Price band restricted to 5% or lower

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements Stage I surveillance measures under the GSM framework, which is a progressive surveillance mechanism with four stages of increasing restrictions. Stage I represents the initial level of enhanced surveillance with moderate trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must collect 100% margin from clients for trades in LCCINFOTEC
- Settlement must be done on trade-to-trade basis only
- No netting off of positions is permitted
- Members must ensure compliance with 5% price band restrictions
- Enhanced due diligence required when accepting orders for this security

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** November 19, 2025
- **Effective Date:** November 20, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** High - The 100% margin requirement and trade-to-trade settlement will significantly reduce liquidity and trading volumes in LCCINFOTEC. The 5% price band limits price discovery and volatility.

**Investor Impact:** High - Retail and institutional investors will face higher capital requirements (100% upfront margin) and cannot net off positions, increasing holding costs and reducing trading flexibility.

**Market Operations:** The trade-to-trade settlement mechanism increases operational burden on brokers and clearing members, requiring individual settlement of each trade without multilateral netting benefits.

**Risk Mitigation:** This surveillance measure aims to curb excessive speculation and protect investors by reducing leverage and limiting price movements in securities exhibiting concerning trading patterns.

## GSM Framework Overview

The Graded Surveillance Measure operates in four progressive stages:

- **Stage I:** 100% margin, 5% price band, trade-to-trade settlement
- **Stage II:** Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) of 50% by buyers
- **Stage III:** Trading once a week only, ASD 100%
- **Stage IV:** Trading once a week, ASD 100%, no upward price movement allowed
