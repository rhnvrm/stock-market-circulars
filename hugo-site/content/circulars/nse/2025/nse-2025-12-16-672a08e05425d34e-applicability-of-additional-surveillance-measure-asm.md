title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - December 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has issued circular 972/2025 placing Vipul Limited under the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) Framework Stage-I effective December 19, 2025. This action imposes a 100% margin requirement on all open and new positions in the security. The surveillance measure is applied based on predetermined criteria and is not an adverse action against the company.

## Key Points

- Vipul Limited (Symbol: VIPULLTD, ISIN: INE946H01037) shortlisted under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- 100% margin requirement applicable on all positions from December 19, 2025
- Margin applies to both open positions as on December 18, 2025 and new positions from December 19, 2025 onwards
- No securities moved to Stage-IV (Trade-for-Trade segment) in this circular
- No securities moved between stages (I to II, II to III, I to IV, or II to IV)
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- This is a market surveillance action and not an adverse finding against the company

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework as per previous circulars (NSE/SURV/39265, NSE/SURV/45111, NSE/SURV/46557, NSE/SURV/48506, NSE/SURV/52090, NSE/SURV/63362, and NSE/SURV/64066). Securities under Stage-IV would be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE), but no securities qualify under this category in the current circular.

- Margin requirement applies to all open positions as on December 18, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: High impact on Vipul Limited as 100% margin requirement significantly reduces leverage availability and may lead to reduced liquidity and trading volumes in the security.

**Market Participants**: Traders and investors holding positions in Vipul Limited will need to maintain full margin, increasing capital requirements substantially.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers must ensure systems are updated to collect 100% margin for the affected security and communicate the requirement to clients holding positions.

**Liquidity Impact**: The enhanced margin requirement typically results in reduced trading activity and lower liquidity in the affected security.
