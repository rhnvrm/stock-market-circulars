title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - Alps Industries Limited
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a circular regarding the applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) effective December 16, 2025. Alps Industries Limited (Symbol: ALPSINDUS, ISIN: INE093B01015) has been included under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I. The security will be subject to 100% margin requirement on all open positions and new positions created from December 16, 2025 onwards. This surveillance action is purely market-based and should not be construed as adverse action against the company.

## Key Points

- Alps Industries Limited shortlisted under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- 100% margin requirement applicable from December 16, 2025
- Margin applies to both open positions as on December 15, 2025 and new positions from December 16, 2025 onwards
- No securities moved to Stage-IV (Trade-for-Trade segment)
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other surveillance measures
- Action is purely surveillance-based, not an adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

The circular references previous NSE circulars establishing the ASM framework (NSE/SURV/39265, NSE/SURV/45111, NSE/SURV/46557, NSE/SURV/48506, NSE/SURV/52090, NSE/SURV/63362, and NSE/SURV/64066). Securities meeting Long-Term ASM criteria are subject to enhanced margin requirements. Securities qualifying under Criteria VII would be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE), though no securities currently qualify for this in the present circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure 100% margin is maintained for ALPSINDUS effective December 16, 2025
- Margin requirement applies to all open positions existing on December 15, 2025
- Margin requirement applies to all new positions created from December 16, 2025 onwards
- Members should refer to NSE FAQs on Additional Surveillance Measure at https://www.nseindia.com/regulations/additional-surveillance-measure

## Important Dates

- **December 11, 2025**: Circular issued
- **December 15, 2025**: Cut-off date for existing open positions
- **December 16, 2025**: Effective date for 100% margin requirement on ALPSINDUS

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: High impact on Alps Industries Limited as 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for trading. This will likely reduce liquidity and trading volumes in the security. Traders and investors holding positions will need to arrange additional margins.

**Market Impact**: Limited broader market impact as only one security is affected in this circular. However, demonstrates continued vigilance by NSE surveillance department in monitoring securities.

**Investor Impact**: Existing position holders must ensure adequate margin by December 16, 2025. New traders will face higher capital requirements, potentially deterring speculative activity in the security.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to update their risk management systems and communicate margin requirements to clients holding or intending to trade ALPSINDUS.
