**Operational Impact:** Participants need to plan their borrowing and lending strategies around these holidays. Settlement cycles and margin requirements should account for extended non-trading periods, particularly during consecutive holidays.

**Planning Considerations:** The holiday schedule allows market participants to plan their SLBS activities, manage collateral requirements, and structure lending/borrowing transactions accounting for market closure days. The Muhurat Trading session provides a special trading opportunity during Diwali celebrations.
