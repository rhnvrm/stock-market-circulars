title: Revoke of Temporary Suspension for Subscriptions in Invesco Mutual Fund Schemes
  on NSE MF Invest Platform
---

## Summary

National Stock Exchange of India has revoked the temporary suspension on subscriptions for three overseas fund of fund schemes of Invesco Mutual Fund on the NSE MF Invest Platform. The schemes will accept lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh registrations for Systematic Investment Plans (SIP) and Systematic Transfer Plans (STP) from December 05, 2025. Subscriptions will be allowed only within available headroom without breaching overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022 at the Fund level.

## Key Points

- Three Invesco overseas fund of fund schemes to resume accepting subscriptions from December 05, 2025
- Enabled transactions: Lumpsum purchase, Switch-in, and fresh SIP/STP registrations
- Subscriptions subject to headroom available within overseas investment limits (as of February 1, 2022)
- AMC reserves right to temporarily suspend subscriptions if overseas investments approach the limits
- All other terms and conditions of Scheme Information Documents and Key Information Memorandums remain unchanged

## Affected Schemes

The following three schemes are affected by this circular:

1. Invesco India - Invesco Global Equity Income Fund of Fund
2. Invesco India - Invesco Pan European Equity Fund of Fund
3. Invesco India - Invesco Global Consumer Trends Fund of Fund

## Regulatory Changes

This circular revokes the temporary suspension notice dated October 9, 2025 for the designated Invesco schemes. The resumption is conditional and monitored:

- Subscriptions allowed only up to available headroom without breaching overseas investment limits set as of February 1, 2022
- Asset Management Company retains authority to re-suspend subscriptions if overseas investment limits are approached

## Compliance Requirements

**For NSE Members:**
- Take note of the scheme enablement on NSE MF Invest Platform
- Facilitate lumpsum purchases, switch-ins, and fresh SIP/STP registrations for the three designated schemes from December 05, 2025

**For Invesco Asset Management:**
- Monitor overseas investment limits at Fund level
- Exercise right to suspend subscriptions if limits are approached

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date:** December 04, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 05, 2025 - Resumption of subscriptions for the three designated schemes
- **Reference Date for Limits:** February 1, 2022 - Overseas investment limits baseline

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This affects only three specific overseas fund of fund schemes within Invesco Mutual Fund's portfolio.

**Investor Impact:** Positive for investors interested in these schemes - restores ability to make fresh investments, switch-ins, and start new SIPs/STPs after the suspension period since October 9, 2025.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal - Standard operational change for NSE MF Invest Platform members to re-enable transaction types for specific schemes.

**Risk Considerations:** The conditional nature of the resumption (subject to headroom availability) means subscriptions could be suspended again if overseas investment limits are approached, requiring ongoing monitoring by the AMC.
