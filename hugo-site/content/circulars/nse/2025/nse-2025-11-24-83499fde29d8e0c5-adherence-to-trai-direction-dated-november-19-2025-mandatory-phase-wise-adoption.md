title: Adherence to TRAI Direction dated November 19, 2025- Mandatory Phase-wise Adoption
  of 1600-Series Numbers
---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange has issued a circular regarding TRAI's Direction dated November 19, 2025, mandating phase-wise adoption of 1600-series telephone numbers by entities regulated by RBI, SEBI and PFRDA. This measure is designed to prevent misuse of 10-digit numbers for service/transactional calls, which have been linked to UCC (Unsolicited Commercial Communication), spoofing and impersonation frauds in the BFSI sector. The Direction follows DoT's allocation of the dedicated "1600" series exclusively for Government and BFSI entities.

## Key Points

- TRAI has mandated phase-wise adoption of 1600-series numbers for all service and transactional voice calls by SEBI-regulated entities
- The Direction was issued under section 13, read with sub-clauses (i) and (v) of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 11 of the TRAI Act, 1997
- DoT allocated the dedicated "1600" series on December 23, 2024, exclusively for Government and BFSI entities
- The mandate is based on FY 2024-25 consumer awareness findings showing persistent misuse of 10-digit numbers
- Post-deadline non-compliance will result in regulatory action applicable to unregistered telemarketers in case of UCC complaints
- Entities must not initiate service or transactional voice calls from non-1600 numbers after specified dates, even with customer consent

## Regulatory Changes

TRAI has implemented a mandatory phase-wise migration from regular 10-digit telephone numbers to the dedicated 1600-series for all service and transactional voice calls made by SEBI-regulated intermediaries. This regulatory change aims to address consumer protection concerns arising from misuse of regular phone numbers for BFSI-related communications, which have led to increased instances of fraud through spoofing and impersonation.

## Compliance Requirements

**Phase-II Entities (Qualified Stockbrokers):**
- Must adopt 1600-series numbers by March 15, 2026
- QSBs are identified in lists published annually on Stock Exchange websites

**Phase-III Entities (Other SEBI-registered intermediaries):**
- Voluntary adoption currently encouraged
- Mandatory adoption timeline to be announced later

**General Requirements:**
- Complete cessation of service/transactional voice calls from non-1600 numbers after deadline
- Compliance required regardless of customer consent (explicit or inferred)
- Strict adherence to operational conditions specified in TRAI Direction
- Trading members must ensure timely compliance with adoption timelines

## Important Dates

- **November 19, 2025**: TRAI Direction issued
- **November 24, 2025**: NSE circular issued
- **March 15, 2026**: Last date for Qualified Stockbrokers (QSBs) to adopt 1600-series (Phase-II)
- **Phase-III deadline**: To be announced for other SEBI-registered intermediaries

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:**
- Qualified Stockbrokers must transition their entire voice communication infrastructure to 1600-series by March 15, 2026
- Requires coordination with telecom service providers for number allocation and migration
- Potential disruption to existing communication workflows during transition period
- Need to update customer-facing materials, websites, and documentation with new contact numbers

**Compliance Impact:**
- High-priority compliance requirement with strict regulatory consequences
- Non-compliant entities will face action applicable to unregistered telemarketers for UCC complaints
- No exemptions available even with customer consent after deadline

**Market Impact:**
- Enhanced consumer protection against fraud, spoofing and impersonation
- Improved trust in communications from SEBI-regulated entities
- Industry-wide standardization of communication channels for BFSI sector
- Other SEBI intermediaries should begin planning for voluntary adoption ahead of Phase-III mandate
