## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing of preferentially allotted shares from warrant conversions. The quantities are relatively small (47,962 shares for Black Box and 562,303 shares for SPML Infra) and will have limited impact on overall market liquidity or pricing for these securities.

**Company Impact**: Moderate for the specific companies involved. The warrant conversion represents successful fundraising completion and increases the freely tradable share base (post lock-in expiry). The lock-in periods provide stability by preventing immediate selling pressure.

**Investor Impact**: Low to moderate. Existing shareholders experience minor dilution. Warrant holders who converted now have tradable securities (subject to lock-in). The pari passu status ensures equal rights with existing equity shares. Market participants can trade these securities from December 18, 2025, subject to lock-in restrictions.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Standard listing procedures apply with designated codes and lot sizes already specified for seamless trading system integration.
