## Summary

NSE has issued updates to its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective December 29-30, 2025. Securities under ESM will attract a minimum 100% margin on all positions and be shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST). Two securities are moving from Stage I to Stage II, two are moving from Stage II to Stage I, and one security (AHCL - Anlon Healthcare Limited) is being excluded from the ESM framework.

## Key Points

- No new securities are being added to ESM Stage I
- Two securities moving from Stage I to Stage II: Divine Hira Jewellers Limited (DIVINEHIRA) and Teerth Gopicon Limited (TGL)
- Two securities moving from Stage II to Stage I: Nephro Care India Limited (NEPHROCARE) and Tankup Engineers Limited (TANKUP)
- One security being excluded from ESM framework: Anlon Healthcare Limited (AHCL)
- All ESM securities will shift from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment
- Securities moving to Stage II will be under Trade for Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- ESM shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

- Minimum 100% margin requirement applies to all open positions and new positions in ESM securities
- Securities under ESM will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST)
- Stage II securities will operate under Periodic Call Auction mechanism with restricted 2% price band
- Price bands for securities exiting the framework will be reinstated to pre-ESM levels, subject to no other surveillance measures being applicable

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must ensure 100% margin is collected for all ESM securities effective December 30, 2025
- Margin applies to both existing open positions as on December 29, 2025 and new positions from December 30, 2025
- Trading members must adapt to Trade-for-Trade settlement requirements for affected securities
- Stage II securities can only be traded through Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band from December 29, 2025

## Important Dates

- **December 26, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **December 29, 2025**: Stage II securities shift to Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction; securities move between stages; AHCL excluded from ESM
- **December 30, 2025**: 100% margin becomes effective on all positions; all ESM securities shift to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST)

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Trading:**
- 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for traders holding ESM securities
- Trade-for-Trade mechanism eliminates intraday trading opportunities and requires full upfront payment
- 2% price band restriction on Stage II securities severely limits price movement and liquidity
- Periodic Call Auction mechanism for Stage II securities reduces trading frequency to specific auction sessions

**Affected Securities:**
- **DIVINEHIRA** and **TGL**: Escalation to Stage II indicates heightened surveillance concerns with stricter trading restrictions
- **NEPHROCARE** and **TANKUP**: De-escalation to Stage I provides slight relief but still under enhanced surveillance
- **AHCL**: Complete removal from ESM framework allows return to normal trading conditions

**Market Participants:**
- Existing position holders must arrange additional margin by December 30, 2025
- Liquidity likely to decrease significantly in affected securities due to trading restrictions
- Investors should review exposure to these securities given increased trading costs and reduced flexibility
