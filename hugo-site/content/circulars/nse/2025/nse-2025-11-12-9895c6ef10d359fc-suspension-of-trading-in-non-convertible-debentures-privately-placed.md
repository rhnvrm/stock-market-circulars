## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements existing provisions under Regulation 3.1.2 of the National Stock Exchange Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A for suspension of debt securities upon redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must cease trading in the specified ISINs from the suspension date
- All trading systems and records should be updated to reflect the suspension status
- Members should inform clients holding or trading these securities about the suspension

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: November 12, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 13, 2025 (suspension date for all four NCDs)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine administrative action related to the normal lifecycle of debt securities. Redemption-based suspensions are expected events for NCDs reaching maturity.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Trading members need to update their systems to prevent trading in these specific ISINs. Investors holding these securities will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms of the debentures.

**Investor Impact**: Neutral to positive for debenture holders who will receive their principal and final interest payments upon redemption. No action required from investors as redemption is typically handled automatically through the depository system.
