- **December 29, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **December 30, 2025**: Effective date for ASM IBC applicability to Indosolar Limited (WAAREEINDO)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited impact as only one security is being added to ASM IBC Stage I. The measure is surveillance-focused and does not immediately restrict trading.

**Affected Security**: Indosolar Limited (WAAREEINDO, ISIN: INE866K01023) will be subject to enhanced surveillance monitoring under the IBC framework.

**Investor Consideration**: The shortlisting is based on market surveillance criteria related to insolvency proceedings and does not constitute an adverse regulatory action. However, investors should exercise caution when trading in securities under ASM IBC.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ASM may face additional trading restrictions or enhanced monitoring, though specific trading conditions are governed by the broader ASM framework referenced in earlier circulars.
