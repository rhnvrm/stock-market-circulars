## Impact Assessment

This is a standard ETF listing with minimal market-wide impact. The listing provides investors with a new investment vehicle focused on IPO securities listed on BSE. The ETF structure allows retail and institutional investors to gain diversified exposure to recently listed companies through a single tradable security. With four appointed market makers, adequate liquidity should be ensured for trading. The relatively high issue price (Rs. 49.22) compared to face value (Rs. 10) suggests the underlying portfolio has appreciated since scheme inception.
