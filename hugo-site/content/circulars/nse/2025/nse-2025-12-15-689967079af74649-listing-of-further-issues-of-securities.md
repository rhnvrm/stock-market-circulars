## Impact Assessment

This QIP represents a significant capital raise by Swiggy Limited with approximately 26.67 crore new equity shares being issued. At the issue price of Rs. 375 per share, this translates to gross proceeds of approximately Rs. 10,000 crores. The shares are pari passu with existing equity shares and have no lock-in restrictions, meaning they are immediately tradable. The substantial increase in share count will result in dilution for existing shareholders. Market participants should factor in the increased float when trading SWIGGY shares from December 16, 2025 onwards.
