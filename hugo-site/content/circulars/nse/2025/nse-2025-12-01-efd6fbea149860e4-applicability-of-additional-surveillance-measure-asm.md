  Updates
---

## Summary

NSE has issued updates to the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework. One security, Kody Technolab Limited (KODYTECH, ISIN: INE0Q7P01013), has been moved from Stage-I to Stage-II of the Long-Term ASM framework effective December 02, 2025. This will result in a 100% margin requirement on all positions effective December 04, 2025. No securities have been newly added to Stage-I or Stage-IV, and no securities are moving to Stage-III or Stage-IV from lower stages.

## Key Points

- Kody Technolab Limited (KODYTECH) moves from Long-Term ASM Stage-I to Stage-II
- 100% margin requirement will apply to this security
- Margin applies to all open positions as on December 03, 2025 and new positions from December 04, 2025 onwards
- No securities newly added to Stage-I or Stage-IV
- No securities moving to Stage-III or being shifted to Trade-for-Trade segment
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other surveillance measures
- Circular references previous circulars dating back to October 27, 2018

## Regulatory Changes

Enhanced surveillance under Long-Term ASM framework for Kody Technolab Limited, escalating from Stage-I to Stage-II. This represents a progression in the surveillance intensity for the security based on predefined criteria established in earlier circulars.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure 100% margin on Kody Technolab Limited effective December 04, 2025
- Margin requirement applies to:
  - All open positions as on December 03, 2025
  - All new positions created from December 04, 2025 onwards
- Members should monitor and comply with the enhanced surveillance requirements
- Risk management systems must be updated to reflect the new margin requirements

## Important Dates

- **December 01, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **December 02, 2025**: Effective date for stage movement (Kody Technolab to Stage-II)
- **December 03, 2025**: Last date for existing open positions before new margin applies
- **December 04, 2025**: 100% margin requirement becomes applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited market-wide impact as only one security is affected. However, for Kody Technolab Limited specifically, the impact is significant.

**Trading Impact**: The 100% margin requirement will substantially increase capital requirements for traders holding or taking positions in KODYTECH. This typically results in reduced liquidity and trading volumes for the affected security.

**Investor Impact**: Existing position holders will need to arrange for additional margins, while potential new investors will face higher capital requirements. This may lead to reduced participation in the stock.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to update their risk management systems and inform clients about the enhanced margin requirements before the December 04, 2025 deadline.

Note: NSE clarifies that ASM shortlisting is purely for market surveillance purposes and should not be construed as adverse action against the company.
