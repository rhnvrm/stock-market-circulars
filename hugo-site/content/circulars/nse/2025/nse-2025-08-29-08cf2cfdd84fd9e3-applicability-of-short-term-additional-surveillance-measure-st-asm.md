## Summary

NSE has announced the inclusion of two securities under Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I, requiring increased margin rates of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher) capped at 100%. Three securities are being excluded from the ASM framework.

## Key Points

- Two securities added to ST-ASM Stage I: Jeyyam Global Foods Limited (JEYYAM) and Yash Optics & Lens Limited (YASHOPTICS)
- Margin requirement increases to 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher, subject to 100% cap
- Three securities excluded from ASM framework: Ideal Technoplast Industries Limited (IDEALTECHO), Shanthala FMCG Products Limited (SHANTHALA), and Signpost India Limited (SIGNPOST)
- No securities in ST-ASM Stage II or moving between stages
- ASM framework works in conjunction with other surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of ST-ASM Stage I surveillance measure with specific margin requirements for identified securities based on market surveillance criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must apply 50% margin or existing margin (whichever higher) on all open positions as of September 1, 2025
- New positions created from September 2, 2025 onwards subject to enhanced margin requirements
- Maximum margin rate capped at 100%

## Important Dates

- **September 1, 2025**: ST-ASM Stage I becomes applicable for listed securities
- **September 2, 2025**: Enhanced margin requirements take effect for new positions

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as only two securities are affected by increased margin requirements. The exclusion of three securities from ASM framework provides relief to those stocks. Enhanced margins may reduce speculative trading in the affected securities while maintaining market integrity through surveillance measures.
