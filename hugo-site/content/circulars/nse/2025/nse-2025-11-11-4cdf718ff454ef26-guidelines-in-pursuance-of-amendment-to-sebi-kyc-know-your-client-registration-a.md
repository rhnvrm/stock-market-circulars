title: KYC Validation Requirements - Trading Restrictions for Non-Validated Clients
  from November 22, 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has issued guidelines regarding KYC validation requirements following SEBI's amendments to KRA Regulations. Clients whose KYC records are 'On Hold' with KRAs (both Aadhaar and Non-Aadhaar based OVD) uploaded between October 1-31, 2025 will be prohibited from trading on the Exchange from November 22, 2025. These clients will also be unable to square off open positions until they complete validation requirements. The Exchange will flag non-compliant PANs as 'Not Permitted to Trade' based on data provided by KRAs.

## Key Points

- Clients with KYC status 'On Hold' at KRAs will face trading restrictions from November 22, 2025
- Applies to KYCs uploaded to KRA between October 1, 2025 and October 31, 2025
- Covers both Aadhaar-based and Non-Aadhaar based OVD KYCs
- Affected clients cannot trade or square off open positions
- Open positions will naturally expire on contract expiry date
- KRAs share demise data daily; trading members must block debit transactions and suspend trading accounts for deceased investors
- PANs becoming KRA compliant will be permitted to trade on T+1 basis
- Non-compliant client lists available on NSE member portal

## Regulatory Changes

This circular is issued pursuant to:
- SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/FATF/P/CIR/2023/0144 dated August 11, 2023
- Previous NSE Circular NSE/ISC/70772 dated October 13, 2025 on "Simplification of KYC process and rationalisation of Risk Management Framework at KRAs"
- SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/OIAE/OIAE_IAD-1/P/CIR/2023/0000000163 dated October 03, 2023 regarding centralized mechanism for reporting investor demise through KRAs

The amendments strengthen KYC validation requirements and introduce stricter enforcement mechanisms for non-validated clients.

## Impact Assessment

- Systems need to flag and block non-compliant PANs from November 22, 2025
- Daily monitoring required as KRA updates compliance status
- Support infrastructure needed to assist clients in completing validation requirements

**Client Impact:**
- High severity for affected clients who risk losing trading access
- Clients cannot square off open positions, exposing them to expiry risks
- Urgent action required before November 22, 2025 deadline to avoid trading disruption
- Clients achieving compliance can resume trading on T+1 basis
