## Summary

NSE has released the Mutual Fund Service System (MFSS) settlement calendar for September 2025, detailing settlement schedules for both normal subscription (T+1 settlement) and liquid subscription (T-day settlement) transactions. The calendar covers settlement numbers 2025165 to 2025186 for the month.

## Key Points

- Normal subscription follows T+1 settlement cycle with funds payin/payout on subscription date and units payin/payout on T+1
- Liquid subscription follows T-day settlement with same-day funds and units payin/payout
- Settlement calendar covers all trading days in September 2025
- Settlement numbers range from 2025165 (September 1) to 2025186 (September 30)
- Weekend and holiday adjustments are reflected in the settlement dates

## Settlement Schedule Details

### Normal Subscription (T+1 Settlement)
- Settlement type: 'S'
- Funds settlement: Same day as subscription order
- Units settlement: Next trading day (T+1)
- Covers 22 trading days in September 2025

### Liquid Subscription (T-day Settlement)
- Settlement type: 'K'
- Both funds and units settlement: Same day as subscription order
- Note: Settlement 2025169 (September 5) is not listed for liquid subscription, likely due to holiday adjustment

## Important Dates

- **Effective Period**: September 1-30, 2025
- **Holiday Adjustments**: September 5, 2025 settlement reflects weekend/holiday consideration
- **Month-end Settlement**: September 30, 2025 (Settlement 2025186) with October 1, 2025 units payout for normal subscription
