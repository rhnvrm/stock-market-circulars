---

## Summary

NSE has identified 4 companies as non-compliant with Regulation 31 (Submission of Shareholding Pattern) of SEBI LODR Regulations for two consecutive quarters (Q1 FY2025-26 and Q2 FY2025-26). Trading in these securities will be shifted to 'Z' Category (BZ Series) effective December 26, 2025, unless companies comply by December 22, 2025. Additionally, 18 companies already trading in Z Category have been identified for the same non-compliance. The circular is issued pursuant to SEBI Master Circular dated November 11, 2024.

## Key Points

- 4 companies to be moved to Z Category (BZ Series) for non-compliance with Regulation 31
- Non-compliance period: June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025 (two consecutive quarters)
- Companies have grace period until December 22, 2025 to comply and avoid Z Category transfer
- 18 additional companies already in Z Category also identified for same non-compliance
- All trades in Z Category settle on Trade-for-Trade (T4T) basis with no intraday trading
- Circular reference: NSE/CML/71805, Circular No. 2437/2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular enforces existing provisions under:
- SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 - Regulation 31
- SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024

The action taken is a penalty mechanism for persistent non-compliance with shareholding pattern submission requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

**For the 4 Companies Being Shifted to Z Category:**
1. Debock Industries Limited (DIL)
2. Future Consumer Limited (FCONSUMER)
3. Rajesh Exports Limited (RAJESHEXPO)
4. Viji Finance Limited (VIJIFIN)

**Required Action:** Submit shareholding pattern for June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025 quarters by December 22, 2025 to avoid Z Category classification.

**For Trading Members:**
- Prepare for Trade-for-Trade settlement in these securities from December 26, 2025
- Inform clients about liquidity restrictions and settlement changes
- No intraday trading permitted in Z Category securities

**Companies Already in Z Category (18 companies):** Continue to remain in Z Category for existing non-compliances as per previous circulars.

## Important Dates

- **December 15, 2025:** Circular issued
- **December 22, 2025:** Last date for companies to comply with Regulation 31 to avoid Z Category transfer
- **December 26, 2025:** Effective date for shifting securities to Z Category (BZ Series)
- **Non-compliance quarters:** June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- **High liquidity impact:** Z Category securities trade only on Trade-for-Trade basis, eliminating intraday trading and significantly reducing market liquidity
- **Price discovery affected:** T4T settlement restricts speculative trading, potentially leading to wider bid-ask spreads
- **Investor sentiment:** Negative perception due to regulatory non-compliance signal

**Investor Impact:**
- Existing shareholders face reduced liquidity and difficulty in exiting positions
- No margin trading or intraday positions allowed
- Higher transaction costs due to full upfront payment requirements
- Settlement risk increases

**Company Impact:**
- Reputational damage from regulatory non-compliance
- Reduced market capitalization potential due to liquidity constraints
- Difficulty in raising capital through equity markets
- Potential delisting risk if non-compliance persists

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers must implement T4T settlement systems for affected securities
- Risk management systems need recalibration
- Client communication and education requirements increase

**Systemic Observations:**
- 22 total companies affected (4 new + 18 already in Z Category)
- Future Group entities prominently featured (Future Consumer, Future Enterprises, Future Lifestyle Fashions)
- Pattern of chronic non-compliance in certain stressed companies
- Reinforces SEBI's strict enforcement of disclosure norms
