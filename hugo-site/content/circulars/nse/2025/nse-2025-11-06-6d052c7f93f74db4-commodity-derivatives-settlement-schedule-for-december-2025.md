## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a standard operational schedule with no changes to settlement procedures or timelines.

**Operational Impact:** Low. Members should incorporate these dates into their back-office systems and ensure settlement readiness. The cross-year settlement (December 31 trading settling on January 1) requires standard year-end operational preparedness.

**Member Action Required:** Review and update internal systems with the December 2025 settlement calendar. Ensure adequate liquidity and operational staffing for settlement obligations, particularly around the year-end period.
