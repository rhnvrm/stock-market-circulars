title: Changes in F&O Settlement Schedule - September 2025
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has modified the F&O settlement schedule for September 2025, adding September 8, 2025 as an additional settlement holiday alongside the previously announced September 5, 2025 holiday. This change follows RBI press release 2025-2026/1042 regarding changes in public holidays under the Negotiable Instruments Act.

## Key Points

- September 5, 2025 continues to be a settlement holiday as previously announced
- September 8, 2025 is now also designated as a settlement holiday
- This is a partial modification to circular NCL/CMPT/65907 dated December 31, 2024
- Changes are based on RBI press release regarding public holiday modifications

## Regulatory Changes

Modification stems from RBI press release 2025-2026/1042 regarding changes in public holidays under the Negotiable Instruments Act, requiring adjustment to previously published F&O settlement holiday calendar.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE F&O members must note the revised settlement schedule
- Members should adjust their operational planning for the modified settlement dates
- Contact fao_clearing_ops@nsccl.co.in for queries
- Use helpline 18002660050 (IVR Option 2) for assistance

## Important Dates

- **September 5, 2025**: Settlement holiday (confirmed)
- **September 8, 2025**: Additional settlement holiday (newly added)
- **Trade Date September 4, 2025**: Settlement remains September 8, 2025
- **Trade Date September 5, 2025**: Settlement remains September 9, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The additional settlement holiday on September 8, 2025 will affect F&O settlement cycles and member cash flow planning. While operationally significant for participants, this represents a routine adjustment to accommodate public holiday changes and should not materially impact market functioning.
