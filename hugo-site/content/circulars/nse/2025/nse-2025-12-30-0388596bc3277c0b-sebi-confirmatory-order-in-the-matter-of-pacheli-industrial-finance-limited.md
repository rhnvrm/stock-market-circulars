The order confirms the complete market access ban on PIFL and modifies the restraints on six other entities (Noticee nos. 2 to 7) to restrict them only from buying, selling or dealing in securities of PIFL and three specific listed entities: Sunshine Capital Ltd., Abhijit Trading Company Ltd., and Alstone Textiles (India) Ltd.

## Key Points

- SEBI confirmatory order confirms directions issued against Pacheli Industrial Finance Limited in the interim order dated January 16, 2025

- Six entities (Abhijit Trading Company Ltd, Calyx Securities Pvt. Ltd, Hibiscus Holdings Pvt. Ltd, Avail Financial Services Ltd, Edoptica Retail India Ltd, Sulphur Securities Pvt. Ltd) have modified restraints
- Modified restraints for entities 2-7 now apply only to scrips of: PIFL, Sunshine Capital Ltd., Abhijit Trading Company Ltd., and Alstone Textiles (India) Ltd.
- Investigation initiated due to apparent inconsistency between share price movement and reported financials of PIFL
- PIFL is engaged in providing consultancy services related to hotels, lodging houses and other multiple services
- Entities 2-7 identified as preferential allottees
- Three entities were identified as conduits through which funds were routed

## Regulatory Changes

The confirmatory order modifies the scope of restrictions originally imposed on six entities (Noticee nos. 2 to 7). Instead of a blanket ban on all securities market activities, these entities are now specifically restricted only from trading in the scrips of:

1. Pacheli Industrial Finance Limited (PIFL)
2. Sunshine Capital Ltd.
3. Abhijit Trading Company Ltd.
4. Alstone Textiles (India) Ltd.

The complete market access ban on PIFL (Noticee no. 1) remains unchanged and confirmed.
