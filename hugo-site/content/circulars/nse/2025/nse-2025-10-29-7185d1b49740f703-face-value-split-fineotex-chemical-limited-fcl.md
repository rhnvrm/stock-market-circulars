## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium. Face value splits typically improve liquidity by making shares more affordable to retail investors. The stock price will adjust proportionally, with shareholders receiving double the number of shares at half the price.

**Operational Impact:** Exchange members and brokers need to ensure their systems are updated before the effective date to handle the new share structure. Existing shareholdings will be automatically adjusted in demat accounts.

**Investor Impact:** Positive for retail investors as lower face value and reduced share price improve affordability and trading flexibility. Total investment value remains unchanged as the number of shares doubles while price halves.
