## Regulatory Changes

The security has been escalated to Stage III of the four-stage Graded Surveillance Measure framework. Stage III represents heightened surveillance with the following measures:

- **Stage I**: 100% margin rate and 5% or lower price band
- **Stage II**: Trade-for-trade with 5% or lower price band and 50% ASD from buyers
- **Stage III**: Trade-for-trade with 5% or lower price band, weekly trading only, and 100% ASD from buyers
- **Stage IV**: Trade-for-trade with 5% or lower price band, weekly trading only, 100% ASD from buyers, and no upward movement allowed

## Compliance Requirements

- **NSE Members**: Must ensure trade-for-trade settlement for YAARI without any netting off
- **Buyers**: Must deposit 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) of the trade value
- **Trading Members**: Must adhere to once-weekly trading restriction (every Monday or first trading day)
- **All Market Participants**: Must observe the 5% or lower price band limit
- Members should take adequate precautions while trading in the affected security
- For queries, members should contact surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 30, 2025 - Stage III GSM measures become applicable to YAARI
- **Trading Days**: Every Monday or first trading day of the week only

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The movement to Stage III GSM significantly restricts trading activity and liquidity for YAARI Digital Integrated Services Limited. The once-weekly trading window combined with 100% ASD requirement will substantially reduce investor participation and trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding YAARI shares face severe liquidity constraints with trading opportunities limited to once per week. The 5% price band and 100% ASD requirement create additional barriers for both buying and selling. No netting off means all trades must be settled individually on a delivery basis.

**Risk Considerations**: Stage III classification indicates serious surveillance concerns. The GSM framework is typically applied to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements, volatility, or other market integrity concerns. Investors should exercise extreme caution and be aware that further deterioration could lead to Stage IV measures, which would eliminate any upward price movement entirely.

**Liquidity Impact**: The weekly trading restriction combined with trade-for-trade settlement and 100% ASD creates a highly illiquid market environment, making it difficult for investors to enter or exit positions efficiently.
