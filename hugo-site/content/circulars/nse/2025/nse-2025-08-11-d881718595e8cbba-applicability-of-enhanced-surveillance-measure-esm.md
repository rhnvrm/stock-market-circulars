---

## Summary

NSE has announced the inclusion of 2 securities under Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Stage I effective August 12-13, 2025. The affected securities will attract minimum 100% margin on all positions and be shifted from rolling settlement to trade-for-trade segment.

## Key Points

- 2 securities added to ESM Stage I: HT Media Limited and Jay Bharat Maruti Limited
- 100% margin requirement on all open and new positions
- Securities will shift from EQ/SM series to BE/ST series (trade-for-trade)
- No securities are being excluded from ESM framework
- No securities are moving between ESM stages
- ESM operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

- Securities under ESM Stage I will be moved from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST)
- Securities moving to Stage II would be under Trade for Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction (though none are moving to Stage II currently)

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure 100% margin coverage for positions in affected securities
- Trading in these securities will be restricted to trade-for-trade basis only
- Members must comply with enhanced surveillance framework requirements

## Important Dates

- **August 12, 2025**: ESM Stage I applicability begins
- **August 13, 2025**: Securities shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST series and 100% margin requirement on new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities will face reduced liquidity due to trade-for-trade restrictions and higher capital requirements due to 100% margin. **Market Impact**: Limited scope affecting only 2 securities, so minimal overall market impact. **Investor Impact**: Higher capital requirements may reduce speculative trading in these securities, potentially leading to price stabilization.
