---

## Summary

NSE has issued circular 947/2025 regarding the applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) effective December 09, 2025. Two securities - Eldeco Housing And Industries Limited (ELDEHSG) and Sar Televenture Limited (SARTELE) - have been included in ST-ASM Stage I. Additionally, Best Agrolife Limited (BESTAGRO) is being excluded from the ASM framework. The circular references previous circulars establishing the ASM framework and provides a consolidated list of 21 securities currently under ASM surveillance.

## Key Points

- Two securities added to Short-Term ASM Stage I: ELDEHSG (Eldeco Housing, INE668G01021) and SARTELE (Sar Televenture, INE0PUC01020)
- No securities added to ST-ASM Stage II
- No securities moved between Stage I and Stage II
- One security excluded from ASM: BESTAGRO (Best Agrolife Limited, INE052T01013)
- Total of 21 securities now under ASM framework (17 in Stage I, 4 in Stage II)
- Surveillance actions will be as per provisions of Short-Term ASM framework
- Circular references previous ASM circulars from 2018, 2020, 2022, 2023, and 2024

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework established through previous NSE circulars. The ST-ASM is a surveillance mechanism designed to monitor securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or high volatility. Securities included in ST-ASM are subject to enhanced surveillance actions including trade-for-trade settlement, additional margin requirements, and price bands as applicable to their respective stages.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with applicable surveillance actions for securities under ST-ASM Stage I
- Members must be aware of enhanced surveillance measures for ELDEHSG and SARTELE
- Normal trading resumes for BESTAGRO as it exits ASM framework
- Members should refer to previous ASM circulars (NSE/SURV/39265, NSE/SURV/46557, NSE/SURV/52144, NSE/SURV/58558, NSE/SURV/64066) for detailed framework provisions
- Continued monitoring required for all 21 securities listed in consolidated ASM list

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: December 08, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 09, 2025 - ST-ASM measures become applicable for newly included securities and exclusion takes effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to specific securities under surveillance. Investors in ELDEHSG and SARTELE will face enhanced surveillance measures including potential trade-for-trade settlement and higher margin requirements, which may reduce liquidity and increase trading costs.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to adjust their systems and risk management for the affected securities. The exclusion of BESTAGRO provides relief to that security with return to normal trading conditions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading ELDEHSG and SARTELE should expect reduced liquidity, wider bid-ask spreads, and additional margin requirements. The consolidated list of 21 securities under ASM indicates ongoing exchange focus on securities with unusual price behavior or volatility patterns.
