## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must inform investors about the non-business days for affected schemes
- No transactions will be processed for listed schemes on specified dates
- Members should plan investor transactions accordingly to avoid disruptions

## Important Dates

- **December 24, 2025**: Non-business day for ICICI Prudential Global Stable Equity Fund (FOF) and Global Advantage Fund (FOF) schemes
- **December 26, 2025**: Non-business day for ICICI Prudential Global Stable Equity Fund (FOF) and Global Advantage Fund (FOF) schemes

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine operational notification affecting only specific international/global fund schemes during the holiday season. Investors with holdings or scheduled transactions in these schemes should plan accordingly. The non-business days align with international market closures (Christmas Eve, Boxing Day, and New Year's Eve). Domestic equity and other mutual fund schemes remain unaffected.
