## Summary

NSE has issued an update on the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework, applicable from December 24-26, 2025. The circular identifies securities being included in or moved between ESM stages based on surveillance criteria. Securities under ESM Stage-I will shift from rolling settlement to trade-for-trade segment and attract a minimum 100% margin requirement. Securities moving to Stage-II will be under trade-for-trade with a 2% price band under periodic call auction.

## Key Points

- No securities excluded from ESM framework in this update
- No securities moved from Stage-II back to Stage-I
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures

## Impact Assessment

- Liquidity in affected securities likely to decrease significantly due to trade-for-trade restrictions
- Intraday trading strategies not possible in ESM securities
- ALPSINDUS faces additional restriction of 2% price band under periodic call auction in Stage-II

**Operational Impact:**
- Higher capital requirements for trading ESM securities (100% upfront margin)
- Settlement process changes from T+1/T+2 rolling to trade-for-trade delivery
- Increased compliance monitoring required for affected positions

**Risk Mitigation:**
- ESM framework designed to protect market integrity and investor interests
- Measures prevent excessive speculation and price manipulation
- Not an adverse action against companies; purely surveillance-based

**Investor Considerations:**
- Review existing positions in affected securities before December 24, 2025
- Ensure adequate funds/securities for margin requirements
- Consider liquidity constraints when planning trades
