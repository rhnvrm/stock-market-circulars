---

## Summary

NSE has moved DIGJAM Limited (Symbol: DIGJAMLMTD, ISIN: INE731U01028) to Stage IV of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective October 17, 2025. This is the highest and most restrictive stage of surveillance, imposing the strictest trading conditions including trade-for-trade settlement, 5% or lower price band, trading permitted only once per week (every Monday or first trading day), 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) requirement for buyers, and critically, no upward price movement allowed.

## Key Points

- DIGJAM Limited moved to Stage IV GSM effective October 17, 2025
- Trading permitted only once per week (every Monday or first trading day of the week)
- Trade-for-trade basis with no netting off allowed
- Price band restricted to 5% or lower as applicable
- 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) of trade value required from buyers
- No upward price movement permitted
- Settlement on trade-to-trade basis only
- Members advised to take adequate precautions while trading

## Regulatory Changes

DIGJAM Limited escalated from previous GSM stage to Stage IV, which represents the most severe surveillance category under NSE's Graded Surveillance Measure framework. This circular continues the framework established through previous circulars dated February 23, 2017, July 20, 2018, November 29, 2019, November 17, 2023, September 20, 2024, and September 12, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Must ensure trade-for-trade settlement for DIGJAM Limited
- No netting off of positions allowed
- Must collect 100% ASD from buyers before executing trades
- Can only execute trades on Mondays or first trading day of the week
- Must adhere to 5% or lower price band restrictions
- Must ensure no upward price movement in the security
- Exercise adequate precaution when accepting orders for this security

**For Buyers:**
- Must deposit 100% of trade value as Additional Surveillance Deposit
- Subject to trade-for-trade delivery obligations
- Limited to weekly trading windows only

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** October 16, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 17, 2025
- **Trading Window:** Every Monday or first trading day of the week only

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - Stage IV GSM represents the most severe surveillance action before potential suspension, severely restricting liquidity and trading activity in DIGJAM Limited. The prohibition on upward price movement effectively caps the stock price, while weekly trading windows drastically reduce trading opportunities.

**Liquidity Impact:** Very High - The combination of trade-for-trade settlement, weekly trading restriction, 100% ASD requirement, and no upward movement will significantly impair liquidity and make it extremely difficult for investors to enter or exit positions.

**Investor Impact:** High - Existing shareholders face severe constraints on selling their holdings with only weekly trading opportunities and no possibility of price appreciation. The 100% ASD requirement creates a significant capital burden for potential buyers.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Trading members must implement strict controls to ensure compliance with weekly trading windows, ASD collection, and prevention of upward price movements. Failure to comply could result in surveillance action against the member.

## GSM Framework Reference

**Stage I:** 100% margin rate and 5% or lower price band

**Stage II:** Trade-for-trade with 5% or lower price band and 50% ASD from buyers

**Stage III:** Trade-for-trade with 5% or lower price band, weekly trading, and 100% ASD from buyers

**Stage IV:** Trade-for-trade with 5% or lower price band, weekly trading, 100% ASD from buyers, and no upward movement
