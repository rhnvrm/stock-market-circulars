**Investor Impact:** Provides liquidity option for physical SGB holders from 2019-20 Series III and IV who have completed five years of holding. Investors can redeem partially or fully during the specified redemption windows.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to ensure proper KYC verification and accurate data entry on the eIPO platform. The process is streamlined with auto-population of investor details upon entering Investor ID and Investment Serial Number.

**Risk Considerations:** Trading members must verify bank details carefully to avoid return of unpaid amounts. Modification and cancellation are only allowed during the redemption period, requiring timely action.
