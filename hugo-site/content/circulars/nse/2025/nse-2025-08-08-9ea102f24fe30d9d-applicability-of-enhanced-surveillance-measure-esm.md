title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities Movement Between Stages
---

## Summary

NSE has announced changes to Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework affecting multiple securities. New securities will be included in ESM Stage-I with 100% margin requirements, while existing securities will move between stages. All changes involve shifting from rolling settlement to trade-for-trade segment with additional restrictions.

## Key Points

- Securities in ESM attract minimum 100% margin on all positions
- Securities shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade (BE/ST) segment
- Stage-II securities operate under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is for market surveillance purposes and not adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

- Two new securities (ACCENTMIC, JAINIK) added to ESM Stage-I
- Two securities (NORBTEAEXP, TIMESGTY) moved from Stage-I to Stage-II
- Four securities (ARISTO, ATLASCYCLE, CEREBRAINT, ELGIRUBCO) moved from Stage-II to Stage-I
- Securities exiting framework get original price band restored unless under other surveillance measures

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain 100% margin for ESM securities
- Trading only allowed in Trade-for-Trade segment for affected securities
- Stage-II securities subject to 2% price band restrictions
- Compliance with all other prevailing surveillance measures required

## Important Dates

- **August 11, 2025**: Stage-II securities move to Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- **August 12, 2025**: 100% margin applicable on all open positions as of August 11 and new positions; EQ/SM to BE/ST segment shift effective

## Impact Assessment

High impact on affected securities due to significant trading restrictions and margin requirements. The 100% margin requirement substantially increases capital requirements for traders. Trade-for-Trade segment shift reduces liquidity and increases transaction costs. Stage-II securities face additional price band restrictions limiting price movements to 2%.
