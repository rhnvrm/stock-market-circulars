## Important Dates

- **December 24, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **December 26, 2025**: First set of revised limits becomes effective (MWPL: 12,223,323 shares; TM/FII/FPI/MF: 3,666,750 shares; FPI Cat II others: 2,444,625 shares; FPI Cat II individuals/family offices/corporates: 1,222,125 shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The increase in position limits for NUVAMA indicates growth in the stock's liquidity and open interest in the derivatives segment. The higher limits provide additional capacity for institutional investors and trading members to take larger positions.

**Institutional Impact**: The revised limits affect multiple categories of institutional investors including trading members, FIIs, FPIs (both categories), and mutual funds. The differentiation between FPI Category II subcategories (individuals/family offices/corporates vs. others) continues to apply distinct limits.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and institutional investors dealing in NUVAMA derivatives need to update their risk management systems and position monitoring frameworks to reflect the new limits. The staggered implementation (December 26 and January 1) requires two updates within a short timeframe.
