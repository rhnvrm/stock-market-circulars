## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium impact on IOC derivatives market. All existing option positions will be adjusted with strike prices reduced by Rs 5/-. This affects 66+ strike prices across multiple expiries.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure systems are updated with new contract specifications before market opening on December 18, 2025. Failure to load updated files could result in trading disruptions or pricing errors.

**Trader Impact**: Open positions in IOC F&O contracts will be automatically adjusted. Traders should verify adjusted positions and strikes post ex-date. The Rs 5/- dividend represents approximately 3% of current strike levels (e.g., 5/150 = 3.3%), making this a material adjustment for option strategies and hedging positions.
