## Summary

NSE has announced that LCC INFOTECH LIMITED (Symbol: LCCINFOTEC) will be moved to Stage II of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective December 01, 2025. The security will transition from EQ series to BE series and will be subject to trade-for-trade settlement with a 5% price band and 50% Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) requirement for buyers.

## Key Points

- LCC INFOTECH LIMITED (ISIN: INE938A01021) is the only security being moved to Stage II of GSM
- Series will change from EQ to BE effective December 01, 2025
- Trade-for-trade settlement will be mandatory with no netting off allowed
- Price band restricted to 5% or lower as applicable
- Buyers must deposit 50% Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) of trade value
- Members advised to take adequate precautions while trading in this security

## Regulatory Changes

The security is being escalated from Stage I to Stage II under the GSM framework. Stage II surveillance actions include:

- **Trade Settlement**: Trade-for-trade basis only, with no netting off permitted
- **Additional Surveillance Deposit**: 50% of trade value to be deposited by buyers
- **Price Band**: Restricted to 5% or lower as applicable
- **Series Change**: Security moves from EQ (equity) to BE (trade-to-trade) series

The complete GSM framework consists of four stages with progressively stricter measures:
- **Stage I**: 100% margin rate and 5% price band
- **Stage II**: Trade-for-trade with 5% price band and 50% ASD
- **Stage III**: Trade-for-trade with 5% price band, weekly trading (Mondays only), and 100% ASD
- **Stage IV**: Trade-for-trade with 5% price band, weekly trading, 100% ASD, and no upward price movement

## Compliance Requirements

- **NSE Members**: Must ensure adequate precautions while trading in LCCINFOTEC
- **Buyers**: Must deposit 50% ASD of trade value for all purchases
- **Settlement**: All trades must be settled on trade-to-trade basis without netting off
- **Price Limits**: Trading must adhere to 5% or lower price band restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: November 28, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 01, 2025 (Stage II measures become applicable)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The move to Stage II GSM significantly restricts trading flexibility and increases capital requirements for buyers. The 50% ASD requirement will substantially increase the cost of trading and may reduce liquidity in the security.

**Operational Impact**: High - Members must update their systems to handle trade-for-trade settlement, series change from EQ to BE, and ensure proper collection and remittance of the 50% ASD from buyers. No netting off means increased settlement obligations.

**Investor Impact**: High - Investors face higher capital requirements (50% ASD on top of purchase price), reduced liquidity due to trade-for-trade mechanism, and limited price movement due to 5% band. The BE series classification signals heightened surveillance concerns.

**Referenced Circulars**: This circular continues the GSM framework established through circulars NSE/SURV/34262 (Feb 23, 2017), NSE/SURV/38389 (Jul 20, 2018), NSE/SURV/42790 (Nov 29, 2019), NSE/SURV/59425 (Nov 17, 2023), NSE/SURV/64066 (Sep 20, 2024), and NSE/SURV/70168 (Sep 12, 2025).
