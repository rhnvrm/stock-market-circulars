title: Applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - December 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective December 9, 2025. One new security, Globesecure Technologies Limited (GSTL), has been added to ESM Stage-I. Additionally, GSTL will be moved from EQ/SM segment to BE/ST (Trade-to-Trade) segment from December 10, 2025. No securities are being moved between ESM stages or excluded from the framework. The consolidated list now includes 58 securities under ESM surveillance - 21 in Stage-II and 37 in Stage-I.

## Key Points

- Globesecure Technologies Limited (GSTL, ISIN: INE00WS01056) added to ESM Stage-I effective December 9, 2025
- GSTL to be moved from EQ/SM to BE/ST (Trade-to-Trade) segment from December 10, 2025
- No securities moving from Stage-I to Stage-II
- No securities moving from Stage-II to Stage-I
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework
- Total 58 securities currently under ESM surveillance: 21 in Stage-II, 37 in Stage-I
- ESM framework applies additional surveillance measures to securities showing unusual price movements or volatility

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework continues to be applied as per NSE's surveillance guidelines. Securities under ESM are subject to:
- Additional surveillance and monitoring
- Potential trading restrictions
- Periodic review for escalation, de-escalation, or exclusion from the framework
- Stage-I represents initial surveillance level
- Stage-II represents heightened surveillance with stricter measures

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the ESM classification of securities
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance status when trading these securities
- Securities in BE/ST segment (like GSTL from December 10) require compulsory delivery and no intraday trading
- Market participants must comply with additional margin and position limit requirements as applicable
- Members should refer to NSE circulars on ESM framework for detailed compliance obligations

## Important Dates

- **December 9, 2025**: GSTL added to ESM Stage-I; updated consolidated ESM list effective
- **December 10, 2025**: GSTL moved from EQ/SM segment to BE/ST (Trade-to-Trade) segment

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of GSTL to ESM Stage-I and its transfer to Trade-to-Trade segment indicates regulatory concerns about the security's price movements or trading patterns. This will significantly impact GSTL's liquidity as intraday trading will not be permitted from December 10, 2025.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading GSTL and other ESM securities face:
- Reduced liquidity due to enhanced surveillance measures
- Compulsory delivery requirements for GSTL (no intraday square-off)
- Higher margins and stricter position limits
- Potential for further restrictions if securities escalate to Stage-II
- Increased trading costs due to T2T segment requirements

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their risk management systems to reflect GSTL's new classification and ensure clients are informed about trading restrictions. The consolidated list of 58 securities under ESM represents a significant portion of securities requiring special monitoring and compliance attention.
