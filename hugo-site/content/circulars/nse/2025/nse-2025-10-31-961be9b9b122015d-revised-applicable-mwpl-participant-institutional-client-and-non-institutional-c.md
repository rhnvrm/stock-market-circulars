## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued revised Market Wide Position Limits (MWPL) and position limits applicable to Participants, Institutional Clients, and Non-Institutional Clients for the Securities Lending and Borrowing Scheme (SLBS) for the month of November 2025. This circular updates the position limits pursuant to NCL Circular No. 037/2025 dated April 30, 2025. The limits are specified in Annexure I and cover over 50 securities and ETFs.

## Key Points

- Revised position limits effective for November 2025 for SLBS
- Four categories of limits specified: Market Wide Position Limit (MWPL), Participant limit, Institutional Client limit, and Non-Institutional Client limit
- Limits apply to multiple securities including major stocks like ADANIPOWER (482.9 million shares MWPL), ALOKINDS (124.1 million shares MWPL), and APOLLOTYRE (39.9 million shares MWPL)
- Participant limits set at 10% of MWPL
- Institutional Client limits also set at 10% of MWPL

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Participants in the Securities Lending and Borrowing Scheme must monitor their positions and client positions against the updated limits for November 2025. The tiered limit structure (MWPL → Participant → Institutional Client → Non-Institutional Client at 100% → 10% → 10% → 1%) ensures risk management and prevents concentration.

**Market Impact:** Medium impact on SLBS participants. The limits vary significantly across securities based on their free float and liquidity. Securities with larger MWPL like ADANIPOWER (482.9M shares), ALOKINDS (124.1M shares), and APOLLOTYRE (39.9M shares) offer more flexibility for lending/borrowing activities compared to stocks with smaller limits like ABBOTINDIA (531,525 shares) or AKZOINDIA (1.4M shares).

**Participant Action Required:** Review current positions in SLBS against new November 2025 limits and adjust if necessary to ensure compliance.
