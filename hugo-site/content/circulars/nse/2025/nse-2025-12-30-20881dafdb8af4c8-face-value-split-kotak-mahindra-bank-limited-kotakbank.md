## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** December 30, 2025
- **Effective Date:** January 14, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High. Face value splits typically improve liquidity by making shares more affordable to retail investors. The lower price per share (approximately 1/5th of current price) may attract more participants and increase trading volumes.

**Shareholder Impact:** Neutral in value terms. While shareholders will hold 5 times more shares, the total value of their holdings remains unchanged. However, improved liquidity and affordability may positively impact future price discovery.

**Operational Impact:** Medium. Brokers, depositories, and trading systems need to update records and ensure smooth transition on the effective date.
