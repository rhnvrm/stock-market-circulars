title: Non-Business Day for certain schemes of Mutual Fund on NSE MF Invest Platform
  for November 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has notified members about non-business days for certain mutual fund schemes on the NSE MF Invest Platform for November 2025. Bandhan US Equity Fund of Fund schemes will observe a non-business day on November 27, 2025, while ICICI Prudential Global Advantage Fund (FOF) schemes will observe a non-business day on November 24, 2025. All transactions including subscriptions, redemptions, switches, SIPs, STPs, and SWPs will not be allowed for these schemes on the specified dates.

## Key Points

- Non-business days announced for specific mutual fund schemes on NSE MF Invest Platform
- Bandhan Mutual Fund schemes affected: All variants of Bandhan US Equity Fund of Fund (Regular and Direct Plans)
- ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund schemes affected: All variants of ICICI Prudential Global Advantage Fund (FOF)
- All transaction types suspended on non-business days: Subscriptions, Redemptions, Switches, SIPs, STPs, and SWPs
- Total 6 Bandhan schemes and 6 ICICI Prudential schemes impacted

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine operational notification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must ensure no transactions are processed for the listed schemes on the specified non-business days
- Members should inform clients investing in these schemes about the non-business days
- Platform operations must be configured to block transactions for affected schemes on the designated dates

## Important Dates

- **November 21, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 24, 2025**: Non-business day for ICICI Prudential Global Advantage Fund (FOF) schemes
- **November 27, 2025**: Non-business day for Bandhan US Equity Fund of Fund schemes

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This affects only specific fund-of-funds schemes investing in international (US) equities. The non-business days are likely aligned with US market holidays (Thanksgiving).

**Operational Impact**: Limited to investors in these specific schemes who will be unable to transact on the designated dates. Members need to update their systems to block transactions for the 12 affected ISINs on the respective dates.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in Bandhan US Equity Fund of Fund and ICICI Prudential Global Advantage Fund (FOF) will need to plan their transactions around these non-business days. No long-term impact expected as these are single-day closures.
