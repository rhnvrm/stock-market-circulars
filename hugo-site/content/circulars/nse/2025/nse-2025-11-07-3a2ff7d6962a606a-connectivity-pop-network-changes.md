title: 'Connectivity - POP Network Changes: Migration Timeline for Sify POP Facilities'
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a reminder circular regarding the mandatory migration of connectivity from existing Sify POP facilities to new POP locations. This follows the earlier circular NSE/MSD/69495 dated August 05, 2025. Three existing POPs are being phased out: STT Kolkata, Jivan Vihar Delhi, and Kohinoor Mumbai. Members must complete migration by the specified discontinuation dates to maintain uninterrupted trading connectivity.

## Key Points

- Three Sify POP facilities are being discontinued: STT Ultadanga Kolkata, Jivan Vihar Delhi, and Kohinoor Mumbai
- Migration applies to both managed service and self-service connectivity links
- Managed Service: Sify will coordinate migration directly with members
- Self-Service: Members must inform their service providers and arrange migration themselves
- Self-service members must bear any shifting costs to new POPs
- 72 hours advance notification required to Sify NOC/Migration team before link shifting
- Connectivity from existing POPs will be discontinued on specified dates

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational infrastructure update for network connectivity.

## Compliance Requirements

### For Managed Service Members:
- Coordinate with Sify for migration execution
- Complete migration within specified timelines

### For Self-Service Members:
- Inform respective service providers about shifting to new POPs
- Bear any shifting costs to new POPs
- Complete migration within specified timelines

## Important Dates

| Existing POP | New POP | Migration Timeline | Discontinuation Date |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| STT Kolkata | SIFY KOL | 120 days from August 11, 2025 | December 09, 2025 |
| Jivan Vihar Delhi | SIFY OKHLA | 120 days from August 11, 2025 | December 09, 2025 |
| Kohinoor Mumbai | SIFY MUMBAI-KURLA / SIFY PARLE | 180 days from August 11, 2025 | February 07, 2026 |

**Immediate Action Required:** Kolkata and Delhi POPs will be discontinued on December 09, 2025 (approximately 1 month from circular date).

## Impact Assessment

### Operational Impact:
- **High Impact:** Members using existing POPs must complete migration or face loss of trading connectivity
- **Critical Deadline:** Kolkata and Delhi migrations must be completed within approximately 1 month
- **Service Continuity Risk:** Failure to migrate by discontinuation dates will result in inability to trade on NSE

### Financial Impact:
- Self-service members must bear migration costs
- Potential downtime during migration if not properly coordinated

### Geographic Impact:
- **Kolkata:** Members at STT Ultadanga must migrate to SIFY KOL
- **Delhi:** Members at Jivan Vihar must migrate to SIFY OKHLA
- **Mumbai:** Members at Kohinoor must migrate to SIFY MUMBAI-KURLA or SIFY PARLE

### Risk Mitigation:
- Urgent action required for Kolkata and Delhi members (32 days remaining)
- Early migration recommended to avoid last-minute issues
- Proper coordination with Sify and service providers essential
- 72-hour advance notification requirement must be factored into planning
