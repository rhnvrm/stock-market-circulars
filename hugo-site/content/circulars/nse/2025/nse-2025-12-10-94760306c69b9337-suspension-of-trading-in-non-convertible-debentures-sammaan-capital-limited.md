## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational action with minimal market impact. The suspension is due to the natural maturity of the debt instruments rather than any credit event or regulatory action against the issuer.

The suspension only affects the six specific NCD series listed and does not impact any equity securities or other debt instruments that Sammaan Capital Limited may have issued.
