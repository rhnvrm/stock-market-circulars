## Summary

NSE has issued a comprehensive circular outlining the procedure for empanelment of vendors providing surveillance software/applications to trading members. The circular includes detailed requirements for system audits, auditor certifications, and compliance standards that vendors and trading members must meet. This framework ensures that surveillance systems used by members comply with SEBI and Exchange requirements for monitoring trading activities.
