## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the periodic review mechanism outlined in the GSM framework established through previous circulars (NSE/SURV/34262 dated February 23, 2017; NSE/SURV/42790 dated November 29, 2019; NSE/SURV/59425 dated November 17, 2023; and NSE/SURV/64066 dated September 20, 2024). The relaxation represents a reduction in surveillance intensity for qualifying securities.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance actions required from members. This is an informational circular regarding surveillance stage changes for specified securities. Members should note the updated GSM status of the listed securities for their trading operations.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 10, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 13, 2025 - Securities move to lower GSM stages

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact on Affected Securities**: Movement to lower GSM stages reduces trading restrictions and surveillance requirements. Securities moving from Stage I to Stage 0 are completely removed from heightened surveillance, while others see reduced restrictions.

**NOIDA TOLL BRIDGE COMPANY LIMITED**: Additional positive impact with series change from BE (Trade-to-Trade) to EQ (Normal Trading), allowing normal market operations.

**Market Operations**: Minimal broader market impact as this affects only five specific securities. Enhanced liquidity and reduced transaction costs expected for the affected stocks.

**Trading Implications**: Lower GSM stages typically mean removal or reduction of additional surveillance deposit requirements, price bands, and other trading restrictions imposed under the GSM framework.
