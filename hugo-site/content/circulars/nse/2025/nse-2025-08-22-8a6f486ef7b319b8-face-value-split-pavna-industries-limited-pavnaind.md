- Current face value and paid-up value: Rs. 10
- New face value and paid-up value: Re. 1
- Split ratio: 10:1
- Effective date: September 01, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action notification for face value split.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members and market participants must note the change in face value
- Trading systems will reflect the new face value from the effective date
- Share certificates and records will be updated to reflect the split

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: September 01, 2025
- **Circular Date**: August 22, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The face value split will make shares more affordable for retail investors by reducing the nominal value per share. The total value of holdings remains unchanged as investors will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held. Market liquidity may improve due to lower share price post-split.
