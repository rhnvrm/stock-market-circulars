- Regulation 2.5.5 of NSE (Capital Market) Trading Regulations Part A for lot sizes

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Inform all clients about commencement of RE trading with correct ISIN
- Clarify that REs are not ordinary shares of the company
- Include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases stating:
  - Purchase of REs only gives right to participate in Rights Issue by applying with requisite money OR renounce before issue closes
  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced by Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished

**For Investors:**
- REs must be held in demat form
- Trade REs during renunciation period or apply for Rights Issue with payment

## Important Dates

- **December 10, 2025**: Circular date
- **December 12, 2025**: Trading of REs commences (effective date)

- **December 17, 2025**: Trading suspension date; Issue Closing Date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects existing Patel Engineering shareholders and potential investors interested in the rights issue. Limited 5-day trading window requires quick decision-making.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure proper client communication and disclaimer compliance. The Trade to Trade segment classification means no intraday trading, only delivery-based transactions.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders have opportunity to monetize their rights entitlements if not participating in the rights issue. Buyers can acquire rights at market-determined prices to participate in the issue. Critical to act within the trading window to avoid lapse of entitlements.
