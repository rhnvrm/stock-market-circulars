title: Applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)

## Summary

NSE has updated the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective July 31, 2025. Three securities have been added to Stage-I of ST-ASM, while eight securities are being excluded from the ASM framework entirely. Some excluded securities are being moved to other surveillance frameworks.

## Key Points

- 3 securities added to ST-ASM Stage-I: Hind Rectifiers Limited (HIRECT), Integrated Personnel Services Limited (IPSL), and Ken Enterprises Limited (KEN)
- No securities in ST-ASM Stage-II currently
- No movements between Stage-I and Stage-II
- 8 securities excluded from ASM framework entirely
- InfoBeans Technologies Limited and Sharda Cropchem Limited moved from ST-ASM to LT-ASM framework
- Akiko Global Services Limited moved from ST-ASM to ESM framework

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to operate with Stage-I and Stage-II classifications. Securities under this measure face enhanced surveillance and potential trading restrictions based on various risk parameters including price volatility, trading volumes, and corporate governance concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of the updated list of securities under ST-ASM
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in ST-ASM securities
- Compliance with additional margin requirements and position limits for affected securities
- Regular monitoring of client positions in these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 31, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework take effect

## Impact Assessment

The addition of three securities to ST-ASM Stage-I will result in enhanced surveillance measures including higher margins, stricter position limits, and additional reporting requirements. The exclusion of eight securities from the ASM framework provides relief to those companies and their investors. The movement of securities to other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM and ESM) indicates continued regulatory oversight through different mechanisms.
