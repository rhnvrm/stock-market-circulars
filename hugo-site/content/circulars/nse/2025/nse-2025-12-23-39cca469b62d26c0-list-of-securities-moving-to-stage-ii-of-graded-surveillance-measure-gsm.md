## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The movement to Stage II GSM significantly impacts trading liquidity and flexibility for SADBHAV ENGINEERING LIMITED. The Trade for Trade settlement requirement eliminates intraday trading opportunities and requires full delivery, substantially reducing trading volumes.

**Operational Impact**: Buyers face increased capital requirements due to the 50% ASD deposit in addition to the purchase value. The 5% price band limits daily price movement, potentially increasing volatility compression and reducing market efficiency.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors must reassess positions given reduced liquidity, higher transaction costs, and settlement restrictions. The series change from EQ to BE signals heightened surveillance status, potentially affecting investor confidence and position unwinding strategies.
