## Important Dates

- **October 14, 2025**: Circular issue date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division from Rs. 10 to Re. 1 (10:1 split) will increase the number of shares outstanding by 10 times while reducing the per-share price proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members must update their systems to accommodate the new ISIN code. Existing shareholders will see their holdings adjusted in depository accounts to reflect the increased number of shares at reduced face value.

**Trading Impact**: The change is effective from ex-date October 17, 2025, giving market participants adequate time to prepare. All post-split trades will settle using the new ISIN, ensuring clean separation between pre-split and post-split securities.
