This transfer follows the previous circular dated November 06, 2025, and is in accordance with SEBI guidelines outlined in circular CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012.

## Key Points

- ALLCARGO to move from trade for trade segment (BE series) to rolling segment (EQ series)
- Change effective from November 26, 2025 (Wednesday)

- Follows previous NSE circular NSE/CML/71152 dated November 06, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The transfer from trade for trade segment to rolling segment represents a relaxation of trading restrictions. The rolling segment allows for intraday trading and T+1 settlement, while the trade for trade segment requires full delivery with no intraday squaring off. This change indicates improved compliance or resolution of issues that initially warranted trade for trade classification.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: November 21, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 26, 2025 (Wednesday) - ALLCARGO transfers to rolling segment (EQ series)

## Impact Assessment

The transfer to rolling segment is positive for ALLCARGO stock liquidity and trading flexibility. Investors will be able to engage in intraday trading and benefit from T+1 settlement cycles instead of being restricted to full delivery trades. This change typically indicates that the company has addressed concerns that led to the trade for trade classification, improving investor confidence. Market participants can expect improved trading volumes and reduced impact costs for the stock.
