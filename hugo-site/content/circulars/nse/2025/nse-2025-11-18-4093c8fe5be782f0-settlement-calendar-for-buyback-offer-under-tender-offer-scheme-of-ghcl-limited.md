## Impact Assessment

**Impact on GHCL Shareholders**: Shareholders wishing to participate in the buyback must adhere to strict timelines, particularly the early pay-in requirement by 3:30 PM on November 26, 2025. Failure to comply with any of the 26 listed rejection criteria could result in non-acceptance of tendered shares.

**Impact on Trading Members**: Members must coordinate demat share transfers through depositories' early pay-in mechanism and ensure all documentation is proper to avoid rejections. The conditional settlement date means members should monitor for potential schedule revisions based on RTA acceptance details or fund receipt delays.

**Operational Considerations**: The comprehensive list of 26 rejection codes (ranging from signature issues to eligibility problems) requires careful validation of all tender submissions to ensure successful participation in the buyback offer.
