## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - All market participants need to plan settlement cycles, fund management, and operational resources around these holidays. The distribution throughout the year requires careful calendar management.

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium - Trading may continue on some of these days, but settlement activities will be suspended. Participants should plan liquidity and risk management accordingly, particularly around clustered holidays in March-April and October-November.

**Planning Requirements:** Market participants should update their 2026 operational calendars, coordinate with banks and custodians, and ensure adequate staffing and fund availability around holiday periods.
