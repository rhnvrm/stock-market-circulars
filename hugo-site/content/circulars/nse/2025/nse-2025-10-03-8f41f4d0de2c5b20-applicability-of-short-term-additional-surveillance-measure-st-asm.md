title: Applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework, placing 6 securities under ST-ASM Stage I and moving 1 security (NIRMAN) from Stage II to Stage I, effective October 6-7, 2025. This surveillance action imposes a minimum 50% margin requirement on affected securities. No securities are being added to Stage II, moved from Stage I to Stage II, or excluded from the ASM framework.

## Key Points

- 6 securities newly included in ST-ASM Stage I: CYBERTECH, GML, RACLGEAR, SAMMAANCAP, SIKKO, THESL
- NIRMAN (Nirman Agri Genetics Limited) moved from ST-ASM Stage II to Stage I
- No securities added to Stage II or excluded from ASM framework
- Margin requirement: 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher (capped at 100%)
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the company
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

This circular continues the implementation of the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework established through previous circulars (NSE/SURV/39265 dated October 27, 2018, and subsequent updates). The framework allows NSE to impose enhanced margins on securities meeting specific surveillance criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Apply 50% margin or existing margin (whichever is higher, capped at 100%) on all positions in affected securities
- Margin applies to:
  - All open positions as on October 6, 2025
  - New positions created from October 7, 2025
- Ensure compliance with margin requirements starting October 7, 2025

**Securities Affected:**

**ST-ASM Stage I (New Inclusions):**
1. CYBERTECH (Cybertech Systems And Software Limited) - INE214A01019
2. GML (Galaxy Medicare Limited) - INE09A801015
3. RACLGEAR (RACL Geartech Limited) - INE704B01017
4. SAMMAANCAP (Sammaan Capital Limited) - INE148I01020
5. SIKKO (Sikko Industries Limited) - INE112X01017
6. THESL (Thinking Hats Entertainment Solutions Limited) - INE0SHE01019

**Moving from Stage II to Stage I:**
1. NIRMAN (Nirman Agri Genetics Limited) - INE0OK701014

## Important Dates

- **October 3, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 6, 2025**: Securities shortlisted under ST-ASM; margin applies to open positions
- **October 7, 2025**: Enhanced margin requirement becomes effective for new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:**
- Significantly higher margin requirements (minimum 50%) will increase capital costs for traders in these 7 securities
- Reduced leverage available for positions in affected stocks
- Potential decrease in trading volumes and liquidity due to higher margin requirements

**Market Participants:**
- Traders with existing positions must meet enhanced margin requirements on October 6, 2025
- New position-takers from October 7, 2025 face immediate 50% margin requirements
- Price band adjustments may occur when securities exit the framework

**Investor Considerations:**
- Enhanced surveillance indicates unusual price or volume movements in these securities
- Higher volatility or speculative activity likely triggered the surveillance measure
- Not an adverse action against the companies, but traders should exercise caution
