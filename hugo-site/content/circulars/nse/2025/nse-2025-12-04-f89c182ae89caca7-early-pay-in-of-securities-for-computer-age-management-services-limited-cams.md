## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Execute early pay-in in old ISIN without adjusting for conversion on December 5 and 8, 2025
- Apply conversion ratio: for every 10 shares sold, deliver 2 shares in old ISIN
- Adhere to SEBI block mechanism requirements per NCL circular NCL/CMPT/53386 dated August 22, 2022
- Do not upload client-wise early pay-in allocation file when using block mechanism
- Switch to new ISIN for pay-in/early pay-in after record date

**For Custodians:**
- Upload client-wise early pay-in allocation details based on actual traded quantity when using pool accounts
- Follow conversion adjustments in depository systems for old ISIN
- Transition to new ISIN after December 5, 2025

## Important Dates

- **December 4, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **December 5, 2025**: Record date and ex-date for face value split; EPI date for settlement 2025232 (use old ISIN)
- **December 8, 2025**: EPI date for settlements 2025232 & 2025233 (use old and new ISIN respectively)
- **After December 5, 2025**: All pay-in instructions to use new ISIN

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - requires careful attention to ISIN usage and conversion ratios during the transition period. Trading members and custodians must update their systems and processes to handle the split correctly.

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium - affects only CAMS securities and participants with positions in this stock during the corporate action period.

**Member Impact:** Members doing early pay-in must understand the conversion mechanism to avoid settlement failures. Incorrect ISIN usage or wrong quantities could result in pay-in rejections or margin implications.

**Client Impact:** Clients selling CAMS shares during this period benefit from early pay-in margin exemption if their brokers/custodians execute instructions correctly with proper conversion adjustments.
