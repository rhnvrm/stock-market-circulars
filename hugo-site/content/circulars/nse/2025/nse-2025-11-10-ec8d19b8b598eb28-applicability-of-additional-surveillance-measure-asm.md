## Summary

NSE has issued circular 872/2025 regarding the applicability of Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework. The circular identifies securities that have satisfied criteria for inclusion under Long-Term ASM, with applicable surveillance actions including 100% margin requirements effective November 13, 2025. Additionally, securities qualifying under Criteria VII (Stage IV) will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (EQ series) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE series).

## Key Points

- 100% margin rate applicable on all open positions as of November 12, 2025 and new positions from November 13, 2025 onwards
- United Polyfab Gujarat Limited (UNITEDPOLY) newly shortlisted in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage IV
- Lancor Holdings Limited (LANCORHOL) moved from Stage I to Stage II
- Securities in Stage IV to be shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE) effective November 13, 2025
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements enhanced surveillance measures under the Long-Term ASM framework:

**Stage Transitions:**
- Stage I to Stage II: LANCORHOL (Lancor Holdings Limited, ISIN: INE572G01025)
- New Stage IV Entry: UNITEDPOLY (United Polyfab Gujarat Limited, ISIN: INE368U01029)
- Stage I: No new securities added
- Stage II to Stage III: No securities moved
- Stage I to Stage IV: No securities moved
- Stage II to Stage IV: No securities moved

**Trading Mechanism Changes:**
Securities in Stage IV will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE) on a T+3 basis.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Ensure 100% margin collection on all positions (open and new) in affected securities from November 13, 2025
- Update trading systems to reflect trade-for-trade mechanism for Stage IV securities
- Inform clients about the enhanced surveillance measures and their implications

**For Market Participants:**
- Maintain adequate margins for positions in ASM securities
- Be aware that intraday trading will not be possible in Stage IV securities moved to trade-for-trade segment
- Monitor ASM framework updates regularly at https://www.nseindia.com/regulations/additional-surveillance-measure

## Important Dates

- **November 10, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **November 11, 2025**: Effective date for ASM stage classifications
- **November 12, 2025**: Last day before margin changes take effect

  - 100% margin requirement becomes applicable on all open positions
  - 100% margin required on all new positions
  - Stage IV securities shifted to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE series)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- High impact on trading liquidity in affected securities due to 100% margin requirements
- Reduced trading flexibility as intraday positions will require full margin
- Complete elimination of leverage for affected securities

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members must adjust margin collection mechanisms
- Enhanced monitoring required for positions in ASM securities
- System updates needed to handle trade-for-trade settlement for Stage IV securities

**Investor Impact:**
- Significantly higher capital requirements for taking positions in UNITEDPOLY and LANCORHOL
- UNITEDPOLY positions will require delivery-based settlement only (no intraday trading)
- Potential reduction in trading volumes and liquidity in affected securities

**Risk Mitigation:**
The ASM framework aims to address unusual price movements and excessive speculation in securities, protecting market integrity and investor interests through enhanced surveillance and stricter trading conditions.
