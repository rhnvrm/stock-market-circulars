title: Applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a circular regarding the applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) effective December 3, 2025. The circular identifies securities that have satisfied criteria for inclusion under ST-ASM Stage I, requiring increased margin requirements of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), subject to a maximum of 100%. The surveillance measure applies to all open positions as on December 3, 2025, and new positions created from December 4, 2025.

## Key Points

- Savy Infra and Logistics Limited (SAVY) included in ST-ASM Stage I
- Mangalam Drugs And Organics Limited (MANGALAM) moved from Stage I to Stage II
- Margin requirement: 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher, capped at 100%
- Six securities excluded from ASM Framework: ARCIIL, DYNAMIC, GSLSU, OWAIS, REFRACTORY, SPECTRUM
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance, not adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

The Exchange has updated the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework to include new securities and modify the status of existing ones. The surveillance action includes:

- **ST-ASM Stage I**: Applicable margin rate of 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher, with maximum capped at 100%
- **Stage Movement**: Securities can be moved between Stage I and Stage II based on market surveillance criteria
- **Exclusions**: Securities meeting compliance criteria are removed from the ASM framework

This circular references previous circulars: NSE/SURV/39265 (October 27, 2018), NSE/SURV/46557 (December 4, 2020), NSE/SURV/52144 (April 28, 2022), NSE/SURV/58558 (September 25, 2023), and NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024).

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Collect and maintain margins of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher) on affected securities
- Apply increased margins to all open positions as on December 3, 2025
- Apply increased margins to all new positions created from December 4, 2025
- Ensure margin requirements are capped at maximum 100%
- Comply with all other pre-existing surveillance measures

**For Investors:**
- Be prepared for significantly higher margin requirements when trading in listed securities
- Maintain adequate funds to meet margin obligations
- Monitor ASM status of securities regularly

## Important Dates

- **December 2, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **December 3, 2025**: Securities included/moved/excluded from ST-ASM framework
- **December 3, 2025**: Increased margins applicable on all open positions
- **December 4, 2025**: Increased margins applicable on new positions created from this date onwards

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:**
- Significantly higher margin requirements will reduce leverage and may impact trading volumes in affected securities
- SAVY will face 50% minimum margin requirement (up to 100% maximum)
- MANGALAM faces even stricter Stage II surveillance measures

**Market Impact:**
- Enhanced surveillance measures aim to curb excessive speculation and volatility
- Six securities (ARCIIL, DYNAMIC, GSLSU, OWAIS, REFRACTORY, SPECTRUM) will see relief from ASM restrictions, potentially improving liquidity
- Overall framework maintains market integrity while allowing normal trading for compliant securities

**Investor Impact:**
- Investors holding positions in SAVY and MANGALAM must arrange for additional margins immediately
- Failure to meet margin requirements may result in position squaring-off
- Reduced leverage may limit profit potential but also reduces risk exposure
