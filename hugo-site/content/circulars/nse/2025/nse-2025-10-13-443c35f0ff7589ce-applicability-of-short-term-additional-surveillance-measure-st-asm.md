## Summary

NSE has updated the list of securities under Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective October 14, 2025. Three securities have been added to ST-ASM Stage-I, while eight securities are being excluded from the ASM framework. The consolidated ASM framework currently contains 24 securities across various stages of surveillance.

## Key Points

- 3 securities added to ST-ASM Stage-I: Capital Trust Limited (CAPTRUST), Jindal Photo Limited (JINDALPHOT), and Jyoti Global Plast Limited (JYOTIGLOBL)
- No securities in ST-ASM Stage-II
- No securities moving between stages
- 8 securities excluded from ASM framework
- ABM International Limited moved from ST-ASM to LT-ASM framework
- Nagreeka Capital & Infrastructure Limited and Take Solutions Limited moved from ST-ASM to ESM framework
- 5 securities completely removed from surveillance: Nirman Agri Genetics, RACL Geartech, Sammaan Capital, Studio LSD, and Thinking Hats Entertainment Solutions
- Total 24 securities currently in consolidated ASM framework Stage-I

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework is applied to securities showing abnormal price movements or trading patterns over short periods. Securities in this framework face additional surveillance measures including:

- Enhanced monitoring of trading activity
- Potential trading restrictions
- Additional margin requirements for trades
- Regular review for stage progression or removal

The framework has two stages with Stage-II having more stringent measures than Stage-I.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of securities under ST-ASM for margin and settlement purposes
- Brokers should inform clients about additional margins applicable on ST-ASM securities
- Trading members must ensure compliance with enhanced surveillance requirements
- Investors trading in these securities may face higher margin requirements and trade-to-trade settlement

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 14, 2025 - ST-ASM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Securities under ST-ASM Stage-I face increased scrutiny and may experience reduced liquidity due to higher margins and trade-to-trade settlement requirements. The three newly added securities will see immediate impact on trading conditions.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading in CAPTRUST, JINDALPHOT, and JYOTIGLOBL will need to maintain higher margins. Positive development for holders of the 8 excluded securities as normal trading conditions resume.

**Market Impact:** Limited market-wide impact as only 3 securities are newly affected. The exclusion of 8 securities indicates improving market conditions for those stocks. The consolidated list of 24 securities in Stage-I represents a small fraction of total listed securities on NSE.
