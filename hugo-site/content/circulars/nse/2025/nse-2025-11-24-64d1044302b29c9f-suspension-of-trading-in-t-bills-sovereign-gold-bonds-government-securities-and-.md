## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - This is a routine operational event that affects the fixed income and debt securities market. While 25 securities represent a significant number, these suspensions are scheduled and expected by market participants.

**Investor Impact**: Low to Medium - Investors holding these securities should already be aware of the redemption schedules. The suspensions prevent trading close to redemption dates, which is standard practice. Investors will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms of their securities.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Standard suspension procedure that NSE members are familiar with. Members need to update their trading systems to block orders for these securities from the respective suspension dates.

**Liquidity Impact**: Low - As these securities approach redemption, liquidity typically diminishes naturally. The formal suspension formalizes what is already a declining trading interest in near-maturity securities.
