## Summary

NSE will conduct a mock trading session on Saturday, November 01, 2025, as per previous circulars NSE/CMTR/71050, NSE/FAOP/71051, NSE/CD/71052, NSE/SLBS/71053, and NSE/COM/71046. During this mock session, the Unique Client Code (UCC) live environment will be unavailable from 11 AM until midnight. Members are advised to refrain from making any UCC modifications or uploads during this period as these changes will not be valid for live trading and will be purged from the system.

## Key Points

- UCC live environment will be unavailable from 11 AM to midnight on November 01, 2025
- Any UCC data added or modified during the unavailability period will be purged
- Modified records will not be considered valid for live trading session from Monday, November 03, 2025 onwards
- Members must avoid making any modifications or uploads during the specified blackout period

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a temporary operational measure for mock trading purposes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members should plan UCC updates before 11 AM on November 01, 2025 or after midnight to ensure validity for live trading
- Members should ensure all necessary UCC modifications are completed before the blackout period to avoid trading disruptions on November 03, 2025

## Important Dates

- **November 01, 2025**: Mock trading session; UCC system unavailable from 11 AM to midnight
- **November 03, 2025**: Live trading resumes on Monday

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Members need to plan their UCC modifications around the blackout window. Any urgent client onboarding or modifications during the 13-hour window will need to be deferred.

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine mock trading exercise with temporary system unavailability. Normal trading operations are not affected except for the UCC system blackout period.

**Member Action Required**: Members must coordinate with their operations teams to avoid scheduling UCC-related activities during the specified blackout period. Contact NSE Investor Services Cell at 1800 266 0050 (option 5) or uci@nse.co.in for queries.
