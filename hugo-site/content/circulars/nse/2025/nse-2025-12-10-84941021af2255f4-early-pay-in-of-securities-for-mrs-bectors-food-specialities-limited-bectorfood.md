## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued instructions regarding early pay-in (EPI) of securities for Mrs. Bectors Food Specialities Limited (BECTORFOOD) in connection with a face value split from Rs 10/- per share to Rs 2/- per share. Members must follow specific procedures for early pay-in using old/existing ISIN before the record date and new ISIN after the record date to avail margin exemption benefits.

## Key Points

- Record Date and Ex-Date: December 12, 2025
- Early pay-in on December 12, 2025 (Settlement 2025237) must use old ISIN
- Early pay-in on December 15, 2025 (Settlements 2025237 & 2025238) transitions to new ISIN
- Conversion ratio: For sale of 10 shares (new), early pay-in should be 2 shares (old)

- Client-wise allocation file should NOT be uploaded when using block mechanism

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements existing early pay-in procedures (Item 10.18 of consolidated circular NCL/CMPT/67751 dated April 29, 2025) for a specific corporate action event.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Members/Market Participants:**
- Execute early pay-in in old ISIN (INE495P01012) for trades on December 12, 2025
- Adjust quantity based on split ratio when making early pay-in (divide traded quantity by 5)
- Adhere to block mechanism requirements per NCL circular NCL/CMPT/53386
- Do NOT upload client-wise early pay-in allocation file when using block mechanism
- Switch to new ISIN for pay-in/early pay-in after record date (post December 12, 2025)

**For Custodians:**
- If providing early pay-in through pool account, upload client-wise allocation details based on actual traded quantity (not adjusted quantity)
- Ensure proper ISIN usage based on settlement date

## Important Dates

- **December 10, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **December 12, 2025**: Record Date and Ex-Date for face value split
- **December 12, 2025**: EPI in old ISIN for settlement 2025237
- **December 15, 2025**: EPI transitions to new ISIN for settlements 2025237 & 2025238

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Members and custodians trading BECTORFOOD must carefully manage ISIN transitions during the settlement period to ensure proper margin exemption benefits. Incorrect ISIN usage could result in rejected pay-ins or loss of margin benefits.

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium - Limited to participants trading BECTORFOOD around the record date. The 5:1 split ratio requires careful quantity calculations for early pay-in to avoid errors.

**Process Impact:** Requires coordination between trading systems, depository interfaces, and back-office operations to handle dual ISIN period correctly. Custodians must maintain separate processes for block mechanism vs. pool account early pay-in reporting.
