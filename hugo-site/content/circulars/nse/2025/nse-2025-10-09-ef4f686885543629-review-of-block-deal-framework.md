title: Review of Block Deal Framework - Modified Trading Windows and Price Ranges
---

## Summary

SEBI has comprehensively revised the Block Deal Framework through Circular SEBI/HO/MRD/POD-III/CIR/P/2025/134 dated October 08, 2025. The modifications introduce two distinct block deal trading windows - a morning window (8:45 AM to 9:00 AM) and an afternoon window (2:05 PM to 2:20 PM) - with different reference pricing mechanisms. The framework maintains the minimum order size of INR 25 crores and introduces a uniform ±3% price band for both windows.

## Key Points

- Two separate block deal windows established: Morning (8:45 AM - 9:00 AM) and Afternoon (2:05 PM - 2:20 PM)
- Morning window uses previous day's closing price as reference price
- Afternoon window uses VWAP calculated from trades executed between 1:45 PM - 2:00 PM
- Stock exchanges will calculate and disseminate VWAP between 2:00 PM - 2:05 PM
- Price range restricted to ±3% of applicable reference price in respective windows
- Minimum order size remains INR 25 crores
- All block deal trades must result in delivery and cannot be squared off or reversed
- Stock exchanges permitted to set trading hours between 8:45 AM to 5:00 PM
- Framework applies to both T+1 and optional T+0 settlement cycles

## Regulatory Changes

**Modified Provisions:**
- Paragraph 1.2 of Chapter 1 of SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD-PoD2/CIR/P/2024/00181 dated December 30, 2024 has been modified

**New Framework Elements:**

- Uniform ±3% price band across both windows (subject to surveillance measures and applicable price bands)
- 15-minute duration for each window
- 5-minute calculation and dissemination period before afternoon window

**Basis for Changes:**

- Disseminate VWAP information between 2:00 PM - 2:05 PM for afternoon window

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Enhanced flexibility for institutional investors with two trading windows
- Reduced market impact risk through segregated large-value transaction windows
- More transparent pricing mechanism with VWAP-based afternoon window
- Potential for improved price discovery with reference to intraday trading activity

**Operational Impact:**
- Stock exchanges need to implement dual window infrastructure
- Real-time VWAP calculation and dissemination systems required
- Trading members must adjust order routing and execution strategies
- Surveillance systems need enhancement to monitor compliance across multiple windows

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Institutional traders gain strategic timing options (pre-market vs. intraday pricing)
- Morning window allows positioning based on overnight developments
- Afternoon window provides execution based on actual market activity
- Uniform ±3% band ensures controlled price movement in both windows

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Mandatory delivery requirement prevents speculative activity
- Price bands limit excessive volatility
- Minimum order size ensures framework serves institutional purpose
- Surveillance measures provide regulatory oversight
