## Summary

NSE has updated the list of securities under the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective December 26, 2025. Seven securities have been shortlisted for ST-ASM Stage I due to heightened surveillance concerns, while five securities are being excluded from the ASM framework entirely. Currently, no securities are moving between Stage I and Stage II, and no new securities are entering Stage II. The consolidated ASM list now contains 27 securities across both stages.

## Key Points

- 0 securities added to Stage II
- 0 securities moving from Stage I to Stage II
- 0 securities moving from Stage II to Stage I
- 5 securities being excluded from ASM framework entirely
- Total of 27 securities currently under ASM surveillance (consolidated list)
- ST-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities exhibiting unusual price movements or volumes

1. **ARUNAYA** - Arunaya Organics Limited (INE0TTG01017)
2. **DCXINDIA** - DCX Systems Limited (INE0KL801015)

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities that have witnessed unusual price rise/movement and protect investor interests. Securities under ST-ASM are subject to:

- Enhanced surveillance monitoring
- Potential additional margin requirements
- Possible trading restrictions including price bands
- Reduced position limits for traders
- Mandatory disclosure requirements

Stage I represents the initial level of surveillance, while Stage II involves more stringent measures for securities that continue to exhibit concerning patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must ensure compliance with additional margin requirements and position limits for securities under ST-ASM
- **Investors**: Should exercise increased caution when trading in ST-ASM securities and be aware of enhanced surveillance measures
- **Brokers**: Must inform clients about the ASM status of securities and associated risks
- **Market Participants**: Should monitor the consolidated ASM list regularly for updates

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 26, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable
- **Circular Date**: December 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Affected Securities**: The 7 securities entering ST-ASM Stage I will experience increased trading costs due to higher margins, reduced liquidity from cautious investor sentiment, and potential volatility restrictions. Conversely, the 5 securities being excluded from ASM will benefit from normalized trading conditions and potentially improved liquidity.

**Market Implications**: ST-ASM placement serves as a warning signal to investors about securities with unusual price movements, helping maintain market integrity. The framework's dynamic nature (securities entering and exiting based on behavior) demonstrates NSE's proactive surveillance approach.

**Investor Considerations**: Traders and investors holding positions in the newly added ST-ASM securities should review their risk exposure and be prepared for potential margin calls and reduced leverage availability.
