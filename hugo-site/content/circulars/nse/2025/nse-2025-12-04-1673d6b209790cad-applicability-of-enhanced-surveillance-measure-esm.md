title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - December 2025 Update
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework, shortlisting securities for inclusion in Stage I and moving securities between stages. Jet Freight Logistics Limited has been newly included in ESM Stage I, while Cura Technologies Limited moves from Stage I to Stage II. Securities under ESM will shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST) and attract a minimum 100% margin requirement. Stage II securities will be under Trade for Trade with a 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction.

## Key Points

- Jet Freight Logistics Limited (JETFREIGHT, ISIN: INE982V01025) newly shortlisted in ESM Stage I
- Cura Technologies Limited (CURAA, ISIN: INE117B01020) moved from Stage I to Stage II
- No securities moving from Stage II to Stage I
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework
- 100% minimum margin applicable on all open positions and new positions
- Securities will shift from EQ/SM series to BE/ST series (Trade-for-Trade segment)
- Stage II securities subject to 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- Consolidated list includes securities like Anondita Medicare Limited, ASL Industries Limited, and Bafna Pharmaceuticals

## Regulatory Changes

Securities qualifying under ESM are shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST). Stage II securities are placed under Trade for Trade with a 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction mechanism.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must apply 100% minimum margin on all open positions as on December 05, 2025
- Members must apply 100% minimum margin on new positions created from December 08, 2025
- Trading members should note that ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- For queries, members should contact surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **December 04, 2025**: Circular issued
- **December 05, 2025**: Stage II securities come under Trade for Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- **December 05, 2025**: Date for applying 100% margin on all open positions
- **December 08, 2025**: Securities shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST segment
- **December 08, 2025**: 100% margin applicable on new positions created from this date

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ESM Stage I will move to Trade-for-Trade segment, eliminating intraday trading and requiring delivery-based settlement. This significantly reduces liquidity and increases capital requirements for traders.

**Margin Impact**: The 100% margin requirement substantially increases the capital needed to trade these securities, both for existing positions and new trades. This measure aims to curb excessive speculation and volatility.

**Stage II Impact**: Securities in Stage II face additional restrictions with a 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction, further limiting price movements and trading flexibility.

**Member Impact**: Trading members must ensure adequate margin collection and monitor client positions in affected securities. System changes may be required to accommodate segment shifts.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these securities will face reduced liquidity, higher margin requirements, and trading restrictions. The measures are surveillance-driven and not adverse actions against the companies themselves.
