The session will include two trading sessions from Primary Site (10:45-13:45) and DR Site (14:15-15:50), along with relogin timings (16:30-17:00). Additionally, NSE and BSE will test a business continuity scenario where BSE exclusive securities will be provisioned at NSE as an alternative trading venue following a simulated outage at BSE, in accordance with SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD/P/CIR/2024/167 dated November 28, 2024.

## Key Points

- Trading Session-2 from DR Site: 14:15 to 15:50 hours

## Regulatory Changes

This mock session implements testing requirements from SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD/P/CIR/2024/167 dated November 28, 2024, which directed NSE and BSE to establish a business continuity mechanism ensuring market participants have an alternative trading venue for interoperable segments. NSE previously provisioned this mechanism via circular NSE/MSD/67344 dated March 28, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must participate in the mock trading session on December 13, 2025
- Only members registered and enabled at both NSE and BSE should participate in BSE exclusive securities/contracts
- Members should trade BSE exclusive securities only for clients whose UCCs (Unique Client Codes) are mapped at both NSE and BSE
- Members must refer to security master of December 12, 2025 to identify BSE exclusive securities (marked with "$" suffix)
- Members should refer to NSE circular NSE/MSD/67344 dated March 28, 2025 for detailed guidelines
- All prevalent trading norms applicable for NSE securities/contracts shall apply to BSE exclusive securities
- Members must monitor broadcast messages for invocation timing: "BSE exclusive securities will be enabled for trading in NSE at hh:mm"

## Important Dates

- **December 11, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **December 12, 2025**: Security master with BSE exclusive securities ("$" suffix) to be available
- **December 13, 2025**: Mock trading session date
  - Trading Session-1 (Primary Site): 10:45 to 13:45
  - Trading Session-2 (DR Site): 14:15 to 15:50
  - Relogin timings: 16:30 to 17:00

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Members need to prepare their systems and processes for the mock trading session, including testing connectivity for both NSE and BSE platforms. This is a preparatory exercise with no impact on live trading.

**Market Impact**: No direct market impact as this is a mock session on a non-trading day (Saturday). However, successful testing will enhance business continuity capabilities for the interoperable segment.

**Member Preparedness**: Members must ensure their trading infrastructure can handle the alternate venue scenario, particularly for BSE exclusive securities. Members should verify UCC mapping across both exchanges for eligible participation.

**System Testing**: The session will validate the technical framework for seamless transition of trading in case of actual exchange outage, strengthening overall market resilience and investor protection mechanisms.
