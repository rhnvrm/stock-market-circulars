title: Prior Instructions Required for Initial Public Offering (IPO) Bid Placement
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a compliance reminder to all trading members emphasizing the mandatory requirement to obtain prior instructions (physical or electronic) from clients before placing IPO bids on their behalf. This circular follows inspection findings where trading members were uploading IPO bids on the Exchange bidding platform without obtaining prior client instructions, violating existing SEBI and Exchange guidelines.

## Key Points

- Trading members must obtain prior instructions (physical or electronic) from clients before placing any IPO bids
- Inspections revealed non-compliance with trading members uploading bids without prior client authorization
- Clients can submit IPO applications through designated intermediaries or online platforms with secure login credentials
- Intermediaries must provide acknowledgement to investors upon receipt of application (counter foil or application number)
- Physical application forms for UPI payments must be retained for 6 months, then forwarded to issuer/Registrar
- Electronic application records must be maintained for minimum 3 years
- This circular reiterates existing requirements from SEBI circulars dating back to 2018-2019

- SEBI/HO/CFD/DIL2/CIR/P/2018/138 dated November 28, 2018
