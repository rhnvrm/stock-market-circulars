## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - The further issuances represent small volumes relative to existing paid-up capital for most companies. ESOP allotments typically have negligible immediate market impact.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal - Small number of shares being added to tradeable float, except for locked-in securities which cannot be traded until lock-in expiry.

**Investor Impact**: Informational - Investors should be aware of increased share capital and potential dilution, though the magnitude is small for most companies. The preferential issues at Apollo Micro Systems (Rs. 114) and Foseco India (Rs. 5,674.12) indicate pricing above par value.
