## Summary

NSE has issued surveillance measures under the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework, placing Rajratan Global Wire Limited (Symbol: RAJRATAN, ISIN: INE451D01029) under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I effective November 17, 2025. This security has been moved from Short-Term ASM (STASM) to Long-Term ASM (LTASM) framework. A 100% margin requirement will apply on all open and new positions starting November 19, 2025.

## Key Points

- One security (RAJRATAN) shortlisted in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- Security moved from STASM to LTASM framework
- 100% margin rate applicable on all positions
- No securities in Stage-IV (Trade-for-Trade segment)
- No securities moving between stages (Stage-I to Stage-II, Stage-II to Stage-III, or Stage-I to Stage-IV)
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements provisions of the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework as outlined in previous circulars (NSE/SURV/39265 dated October 27, 2018, and subsequent updates through NSE/SURV/64066 dated September 20, 2024).

Key regulatory provisions:
- Securities qualifying under criteria VII (Scrips shifted to Stage IV) shall be moved from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE)
- Price bands for securities exiting the framework will be reinstated to pre-ASM levels, unless subject to other surveillance measures

- Comply with all other prevailing surveillance measures simultaneously

- **November 17, 2025**: RAJRATAN shortlisted in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- **November 18, 2025**: Last day before margin requirements apply
- **November 19, 2025**: 100% margin requirement becomes effective on all open and new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- High impact on RAJRATAN (Rajratan Global Wire Limited) stockholders and traders
- 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for positions
- May reduce trading volumes and liquidity in the affected security
- Potential for position unwinding by traders unable to meet margin requirements

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers must update margin collection systems
- Clients holding RAJRATAN positions need to arrange additional funds
- Risk management systems require recalibration for affected security

**Investor Considerations:**
- Movement from STASM to LTASM indicates persistent surveillance concerns
- Investors should review positions and assess liquidity needs
- Enhanced surveillance does not imply fundamental issues with the company itself
- Further escalation to Stage-IV could result in Trade-for-Trade segment classification
