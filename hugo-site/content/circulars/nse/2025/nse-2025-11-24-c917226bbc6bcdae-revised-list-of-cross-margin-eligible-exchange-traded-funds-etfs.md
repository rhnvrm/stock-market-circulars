## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** November 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - This revision affects traders and institutions utilizing cross margining benefits between Cash and F&O segments. The updated list may include new ETFs or remove previously eligible ones, impacting margin utilization strategies.

**Operational Impact:** Members need to update their risk management systems to reflect the revised list. Traders holding positions in removed ETFs (if any) will lose cross margin benefits, while those trading newly added ETFs can optimize margin requirements.

**Investor Impact:** Retail and institutional investors using ETFs for hedging or arbitrage strategies need to verify their holdings against the revised list to ensure continued margin benefits. Changes in minimum quantity requirements may affect smaller traders' ability to utilize cross margining for certain ETFs.
