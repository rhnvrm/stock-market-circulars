title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure under IBC
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework for companies under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The circular introduces staged surveillance with companies categorized into Stage I and Stage II based on their IBC status, along with a separate category for companies requiring corporate announcement disclosures.

## Key Points

- ATMASTCO Limited added to corporate announcement/disclosure monitoring effective September 09, 2025
- SWANDEF (Swan Defence and Heavy Industries Limited) moved to ASM Stage I under IBC
- No securities moved between Stage I and Stage II during this update
- Consolidated list shows 7 securities in ASM Stage I and 11+ securities under corporate announcement monitoring
- Framework includes provisions for stage transitions and exclusions from ASM

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of staged surveillance approach for IBC companies
- Stage I: Initial surveillance level for companies under IBC
- Stage II: Enhanced surveillance level (currently no securities listed)
- Corporate announcement category for companies requiring specific disclosure monitoring
- Provisions for moving securities between stages based on compliance status

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies under ASM must comply with enhanced disclosure requirements
- Securities in Stage I subject to additional trading restrictions and monitoring
- Companies in corporate announcement category must provide timely disclosures
- Listed companies must maintain compliance to avoid stage escalation

## Important Dates

- **September 09, 2025**: Effective date for all surveillance measure changes
- **September 09, 2025**: ATMASTCO Limited added to corporate announcement monitoring
- **September 09, 2025**: SWANDEF moved to ASM Stage I

## Impact Assessment

- Enhanced monitoring may affect trading liquidity for listed securities
- Investors should exercise caution when trading securities under ASM
- Stage-based approach provides clearer framework for surveillance escalation
- Corporate announcement requirements ensure better transparency for distressed companies
- No immediate exclusions from ASM, indicating continued regulatory scrutiny
