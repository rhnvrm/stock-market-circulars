---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has announced that Sikko Industries Limited (SIKKO) will undergo a face value split of its equity shares. The face value and paid-up value will be changed from Rs. 10 to Re. 1, representing a 1:10 split ratio. This change will be effective from November 27, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Sikko Industries Limited (Symbol: SIKKO)
- Current face value: Rs. 10 per share
- New face value: Re. 1 per share
- Split ratio: 1:10 (each existing share will be split into 10 shares)
- Effective date: November 27, 2025
- Circular reference: NSE/CML/71346, Circular No. 2239/2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action where the company subdivides existing shares into multiple shares with lower face value, making shares more affordable and improving liquidity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members and market participants should note the change in face value and paid-up value
- Trading systems should be updated to reflect the new face value from the effective date
- Shareholders will automatically receive 10 shares for every 1 share held
- All corporate benefits and rights will be adjusted proportionately

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: November 18, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 27, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The face value split will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10 times while proportionately reducing the share price. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors. The total market capitalization remains unchanged.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held. Their proportionate ownership and total investment value remain the same, but the per-share price will be approximately one-tenth of the pre-split price.

**Trading Impact**: Enhanced liquidity expected due to lower price per share, potentially attracting more retail participation. Trading lot sizes and price bands will be adjusted accordingly.
