## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine administrative action affecting only unitholders of the specific SBI Fixed Maturity Plan series.

**Investor Impact**: Low. Fixed Maturity Plans have predetermined maturity dates, and investors would have been aware of the redemption timeline. The suspension is a natural consequence of the scheme reaching maturity.

**Operational Impact**: Standard procedure for mutual fund schemes reaching maturity. No disruption to broader market operations expected.
