## Impact Assessment

This revision impacts trading members' collateral management strategies by defining eligible securities and quantity limits for margin deposits. The 40-security basket provides diversification options across sectors including banking (HDFCBANK, ICICIBANK, AXISBANK, KOTAKBANK, SBIN), IT (INFY, HCLTECH), energy (RELIANCE, ONGC, NTPC, POWERGRID, COALINDIA), automotive (MARUTI, BAJAJ-AUTO, M&M, EICHERMOT), FMCG (ITC, HINDUNILVR, NESTLEIND, ASIANPAINT), and other blue-chip stocks. The 25% concentration limit promotes portfolio diversification in margin collateral. The exclusion from CD segment maintains existing risk management framework for currency derivatives.
