## Impact Assessment

This OFS represents a moderate 5% divestment by a non-promoter shareholder in D.S. Kulkarni Developers Limited. The fixed floor price of Rs. 10 per share (equal to face value) provides pricing certainty for all bidders. Market impact is expected to be limited given the relatively small size of the offering and the structured two-day bidding process that separates non-retail and retail investor participation. The OFS follows NCLT-approved resolution plan, indicating this is part of structured corporate reorganization. Investors should note the international distribution restrictions, particularly for US markets.
