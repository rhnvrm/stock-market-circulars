## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Complete halt to trading activity in GOENKA shares affects liquidity and investor ability to enter/exit positions.

**Investor Impact**: Severe - Existing shareholders cannot sell their holdings on NSE. New investors cannot purchase shares. The liquidation proceedings indicate financial distress, though the stay on liquidator appointment suggests ongoing legal proceedings.

**Legal Status**: The company is subject to concurrent proceedings at NCLT (liquidation admitted) and NCLAT (stay on liquidator), creating uncertainty about the final resolution path.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure compliance with suspension, update risk management systems, and handle client queries regarding inability to trade the security.
