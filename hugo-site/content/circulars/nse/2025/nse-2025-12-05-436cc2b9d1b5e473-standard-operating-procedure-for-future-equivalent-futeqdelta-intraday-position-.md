title: Standard Operating Procedure for Future Equivalent (FutEq)/(Delta) Intraday
  Position Limits Monitoring for Equity Index Derivatives - Update
---

## Summary

NSE has issued an update to the Standard Operating Procedure for Future Equivalent (FutEq)/(Delta) Intraday Position Limits Monitoring for Equity Index Derivatives. The glide path framework will cease to exist after December 05, 2025, requiring entities to have their own delta computing/monitoring systems. Starting December 08, 2025, intraday breaches of position limits on options expiry days will attract Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) in addition to end-of-day breach penalties.

## Key Points

- Glide path framework for position limits monitoring ends on December 05, 2025 (ceases w.e.f December 08, 2025)
- Entities must implement their own delta computing/monitoring systems for large delta-based positions in index options
- Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) framework becomes applicable from December 08, 2025 for expiry day intraday breaches
- ASD will be levied at 1.5 times the computed ASD amount for intraday breaches on expiry days
- ASD will remain blocked for one month, similar to EOD breach treatment
- If breach value during cure period exceeds original snapshot, ASD calculated based on revised cure period snapshot
- Benefit of cash and cash equivalents (for net long or gross long side breach) provided as per index-wise allocation in RPT reporting
- Minimum four snapshots during the day required for intraday monitoring of position limits
- ASD applies to: NIFTY, BANKNIFTY, SENSEX, and BANKEX indices

## Regulatory Changes

**Framework Changes:**
- Discontinuation of glide path framework after December 05, 2025
- Mandatory implementation of proprietary delta computing/monitoring systems by market participants
- Introduction of ASD penalties for intraday position limit breaches on expiry days

**ASD Calculation Changes:**
- For expiry day intraday breaches: ASD = 1.5 × computed ASD amount
- ASD calculated on highest of EOD or intraday excess position value
- If cure period breach exceeds original snapshot, ASD based on revised cure period snapshot
- Cash and cash equivalents benefit allocated index-wise per RPT reporting

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- Minimum four intraday snapshots (S1, S2, S3, S4) required for position limit monitoring
- Separate tracking of Net long/Gross long Delta for each index

## Compliance Requirements

**Immediate Actions (by December 05, 2025):**
- Implement proprietary delta computing and monitoring systems
- Ensure systems can track intraday position limits across multiple snapshots
- Set up index-wise cash and cash equivalents allocation mechanisms

**Ongoing Requirements (from December 08, 2025):**
- Monitor intraday position limits through minimum four daily snapshots
- Maintain adequate cash and cash equivalents to avoid ASD on expiry day breaches
- Submit RPT reporting with index-wise allocation of cash and cash equivalents
- Track both Net long and Gross long Delta positions for each index (NIFTY, BANKNIFTY, SENSEX, BANKEX)
- Ensure compliance with position limits during cure periods on expiry days

**Capital Requirements:**
- Calculate maximum excess position value across all intraday snapshots and EOD
- Maintain sufficient cash/cash equivalents to cover highest potential exposure
- Example: For total excess of Rs 1700 cr across indices, maintain equivalent cash to avoid ASD

## Important Dates

- **December 05, 2025**: Last day of glide path framework applicability
- **December 08, 2025**: 
  - Glide path framework ceases to exist
  - ASD framework becomes applicable for expiry day intraday breaches
  - Mandatory use of proprietary delta monitoring systems begins

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members must invest in developing or procuring delta computing/monitoring systems before December 08, 2025
- Increased operational complexity with minimum four intraday snapshots requiring real-time monitoring
- Enhanced surveillance and compliance overhead for index derivatives trading

**Financial Impact:**
- Higher capital requirements due to ASD on expiry day intraday breaches (1.5× standard ASD)
- ASD amounts blocked for one month, impacting liquidity and capital efficiency
- Potential significant costs for those unable to maintain adequate cash/cash equivalents
- Example: Excess position of Rs 600 cr in NIFTY with Rs 50 cr cash deficit would attract ASD

**Market Impact:**
- May reduce aggressive intraday positioning on expiry days due to ASD risk
- Could impact market liquidity in index options during expiry day trading
- Likely to favor well-capitalized participants with sophisticated monitoring systems
- Smaller participants may reduce index derivatives exposure or avoid expiry day trading

**Risk Management Impact:**
- Stricter discipline required for expiry day position management
- Need for real-time delta monitoring and position adjustment capabilities
- Enhanced focus on cash management and index-wise allocation strategies
- Cure period positions now carry higher penalty risk if breach value increases
