## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. These are routine listings of additional shares under ESOP schemes and one preferential allotment. The quantum of shares is relatively small compared to existing equity base for most companies, except Artemis Medicare Services which issued approximately 19 million shares.

**Operational Impact:** No operational changes for market participants. Standard trading procedures apply with market lot of 1 share.

**Dilution Impact:** Minor dilution for existing shareholders, particularly for Aditya Birla Capital (1.38 million shares) and Artemis Medicare (18.96 million shares). Other companies have minimal dilution due to small ESOP allotments.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible impact on overall market liquidity given the small size of most allotments relative to existing float.
