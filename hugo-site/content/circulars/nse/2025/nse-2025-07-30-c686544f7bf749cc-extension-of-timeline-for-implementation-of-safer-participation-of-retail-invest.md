title: Extension of Timeline for Safer Participation of Retail Investors in Algorithmic
  Trading
---

## Summary

SEBI has extended the implementation timeline for the "Safer participation of retail investors in Algorithmic trading" framework from August 1, 2025 to October 1, 2025. This extension was granted based on representations received from Trading Members and ISF participants requesting additional time for compliance preparation.

## Key Points

- Original SEBI circular dated February 4, 2025 (Ref: SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-PoD/P/CIR/2025/0000013) established framework for safer retail algorithmic trading
- Implementation deadline extended by 2 months from August 1, 2025 to October 1, 2025
- Extension granted due to multiple representations from stock brokers and ISF participants
- SEBI aims to ensure smooth implementation without market disruption
- All market participants must note the revised timeline

## Regulatory Changes

No changes to the underlying regulatory framework - only the implementation timeline has been modified. The original provisions of the safer participation framework remain unchanged.

## Compliance Requirements

- Stock Exchanges must bring provisions to notice of members/participants
- Exchanges must disseminate information on their websites
- Appropriate systems and procedures must be implemented for compliance
- Necessary amendments to Bye-laws, Rules and Regulations must be made
- Market participants must prepare for October 1, 2025 implementation

## Important Dates

- **Original Implementation Date**: August 1, 2025
- **Extended Implementation Date**: October 1, 2025
- **SEBI Extension Circular Date**: July 29, 2025
- **NSE Notification Date**: July 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The timeline extension provides breathing room for market participants to properly implement the algorithmic trading safety framework. This should reduce implementation stress and potential market disruptions that could have occurred with the original August deadline. Trading members and technology service providers now have additional time to develop and test compliance systems.
