## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects existing shareholders of Baid Finserv Limited who receive rights entitlements and potential investors interested in purchasing REs during the limited trading window.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update systems to handle RE trading, implement mandatory client communication protocols, and ensure contract notes include required disclaimers. The 4-day renunciation window is relatively short, requiring prompt action from shareholders and efficient processing by trading members.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders must decide within the renunciation period whether to subscribe, renounce, or allow REs to lapse. Purchase of REs does not provide ownership of shares unless subscription application with payment is completed before issue closing.
