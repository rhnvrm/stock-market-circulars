title: Early Pay-in of Securities for BEML Limited (BEML)
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued instructions for early pay-in (EPI) of securities for BEML Limited due to a face value split from Rs 10/- to Rs 5/- per share. Members and custodians must use the old ISIN (INE258A01016) for early pay-in on November 3-4, 2025, without adjusting for conversion, and switch to the new ISIN after the record date.

## Key Points

- Face value split ratio: Rs 10/- per share to Rs 5/- per share (1:2 split)
- Record Date and Ex-Date: November 3, 2025
- Old ISIN: INE258A01016 (to be used for EPI on specified dates)
- Early pay-in must be executed in old ISIN without adjusting for conversion
- For sale of 10 shares, early pay-in should be for 5 shares in old ISIN
- Block mechanism applies as per NCL circular NCL/CMPT/53386 dated August 22, 2022
- Client-wise EPI allocation file should not be uploaded when using block mechanism
- Custodians using pool accounts must upload allocation details based on actual traded quantity

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular provides operational guidance for implementing existing early pay-in procedures during a corporate action (face value split).

## Compliance Requirements

**For Members/Market Participants:**
- Execute early pay-in in old ISIN (INE258A01016) for settlements on November 3-4, 2025
- Adjust quantity: for sale of 10 shares, pay-in 5 shares in old ISIN
- Adhere to SEBI block mechanism requirements for client demat accounts
- Do not upload client-wise EPI allocation file when using block mechanism
- Switch to new ISIN for pay-in/early pay-in after record date (post November 3, 2025)

**For Custodians:**
- Upload client-wise early pay-in allocation details based on actual traded quantity (not adjusted) when using pool accounts
- Execute early pay-in instructions in old ISIN for ex-date/record date transactions

## Important Dates

- **November 3, 2025**: Record Date and Ex-Date for face value split
- **November 3, 2025**: EPI Date - Settlement Number 2025209 (use old ISIN)
- **November 4, 2025**: EPI Date - Settlement Numbers 2025209 & 2025210 (old ISIN for 2025209, new ISIN for 2025210)
- **After November 3, 2025**: Use new ISIN for all pay-in/early pay-in instructions

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Requires careful attention to ISIN selection during the transition period. Members and custodians must adjust their settlement processes for two days (November 3-4) to use the old ISIN with quantity adjustments, then switch to the new ISIN.

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium - Affects only BEML traders and their custodians. The split increases share liquidity by reducing per-share price, but the early pay-in process requires specific handling to avoid settlement failures.

**Risk:** Potential for settlement failures if members incorrectly use new ISIN during transition period or fail to adjust quantities properly. Clear instructions provided to mitigate this risk.
