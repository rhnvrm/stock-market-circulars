---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has disabled certain schemes of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund for fresh subscriptions, Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), and Systematic Transfer Plans (STPs) on the NSE MF Invest Platform effective November 03, 2025. This action is based on communication received from ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund. Existing investments remain unaffected, and investors can continue redemptions, systematic withdrawal plans, switch-outs, and existing SIP/STP transactions.

## Key Points

- Fresh subscriptions disabled for certain ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund schemes on NSE MF Invest Platform
- New SIPs and STPs cannot be created in the affected schemes
- Existing SIPs and STPs will continue to operate normally
- Redemptions remain fully operational without restrictions
- Systematic Withdrawal Plans (SWP) continue without restrictions
- Switch-out and STP-out transactions remain operational
- Effective date: November 03, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is an operational restriction implemented by ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund on specific schemes available through the NSE MF Invest Platform.

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must inform clients about the temporary suspension of fresh subscriptions in affected ICICI Prudential MF schemes
- Members should refer to the notice cum addendum issued by ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund for the complete list of affected schemes
- Members must ensure proper communication to investors attempting fresh subscriptions in restricted schemes
- Existing operational requirements for redemptions and ongoing SIPs/STPs remain unchanged

## Important Dates

- **November 03, 2025**: Effective date for suspension of fresh subscriptions, new SIPs, and new STPs in certain ICICI Prudential MF schemes

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Investors planning to invest in specific ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund schemes through the NSE MF Invest Platform will need to either wait for the suspension to be lifted or consider alternative schemes. Existing investors are not affected and can continue their current investment plans, redemptions, and withdrawals.

**Market Impact**: Limited market impact as this is specific to certain schemes of one mutual fund on the NSE platform. The suspension appears to be a temporary measure, likely related to scheme-specific considerations such as asset size management or portfolio rebalancing requirements.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and distributors using the NSE MF Invest Platform need to update their systems and client communications to prevent attempts at fresh subscriptions in the affected schemes. Back-office processes for handling existing investments remain unchanged.
