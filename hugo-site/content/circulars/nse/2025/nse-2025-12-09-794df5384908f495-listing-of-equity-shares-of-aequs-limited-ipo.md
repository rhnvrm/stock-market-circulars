## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The listing adds a new aerospace and precision engineering company to NSE, expanding investment options in the manufacturing sector. With an issue size of approximately Rs. 8,316 crores (670.67 million shares × Rs. 124), this represents a significant IPO that could attract institutional and retail investor interest.

**Operational Impact**: Standard listing procedures apply. Trading members need to update their systems with the new security code and ISIN. The pre-open session requirement ensures price discovery mechanism is in place from the first day of trading.

**Lock-in Structure**: Approximately 572.5 million shares (85.4% of total) have varying lock-in periods ranging from January 2026 to December 2028, which will limit immediate liquidity. Only about 98.2 million shares (14.6%) are freely tradable from listing date.
