## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The continued additional margins will increase the capital requirements for members holding positions in Gold and Silver futures during tender periods. This may reduce speculative positions and increase cost of hedging for participants.

**Operational Impact**: Members need to ensure sufficient collateral and margin availability to meet the enhanced requirements. The 4.5% additional margin on Silver futures is particularly significant and may impact trading volumes during tender periods.

**Risk Management**: These measures are designed to contain risk during the delivery/tender period when volatility and settlement risks are typically higher. The differential margin rates (4.5% for Silver vs 1% for Gold) reflect different risk assessments for these commodities.
