title: Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Framework Updates - July
  30, 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective July 30, 2025. Two securities have been added to Stage-I surveillance, while two securities have been excluded from the ASM framework entirely. The consolidated ASM list now contains 33 securities under various stages of surveillance.

## Key Points

- 2 securities added to Short-Term ASM Framework Stage-I: Brightcom Group Limited (BCG) and Vimta Labs Limited (VIMTALABS)
- No securities in Stage-II or moving between stages
- 2 securities excluded from ASM framework: Ideal Technoplast Industries Limited (IDEALTECHO) and MIRC Electronics Limited (MIRCELECTR)
- Total 33 securities remain under ASM surveillance (all in Stage-I)
- Framework aims to curb excessive price volatility and speculation

## Regulatory Changes

The Short-Term ASM framework continues to operate with Stage-I and Stage-II classifications. Securities under ST-ASM are subject to additional surveillance measures including:
- Enhanced monitoring of trading activities
- Stricter position limits
- Additional margin requirements
- Periodic review for continuation or exclusion

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with enhanced surveillance measures for listed securities
- Additional margin requirements apply to positions in ST-ASM securities
- Regular monitoring and reporting of unusual trading patterns required
- Investors should exercise caution when trading in securities under surveillance

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 30, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The addition of BCG and VIMTALABS to Stage-I surveillance indicates increased regulatory scrutiny due to potential volatility concerns. The exclusion of IDEALTECHO and MIRCELECTR suggests improved trading patterns. Securities under ST-ASM may experience:
- Reduced speculative trading due to enhanced monitoring
- Higher margin requirements affecting trader participation
- Improved price discovery through surveillance measures
- Potential impact on liquidity due to additional restrictions
