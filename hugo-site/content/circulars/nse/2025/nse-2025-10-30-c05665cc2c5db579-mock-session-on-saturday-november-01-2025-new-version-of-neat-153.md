## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: High - All commodity derivatives members must upgrade their trading systems to NEAT 1.5.3 before the mandatory implementation date. Failure to upgrade will result in inability to trade as existing versions 1.5.1 and 1.5.2 will be discontinued.

**Member Preparedness**: Members have limited time (October 31-November 01) to download, install, test, and migrate to the new NEAT version. The mock session on November 01 is critical for testing connectivity and functionality before live trading resumes on November 03, 2025.

**Business Continuity**: The mock session includes testing from both Primary Site and BCP/DR (Disaster Recovery) site to ensure system resilience and member preparedness for contingency scenarios. Members must participate in both sessions to validate their disaster recovery capabilities.

**Technical Requirements**: Members need to update their systems, test connectivity parameters, ensure UCC/PAN compliance, and validate all trading software integrations during the mock session to prevent disruptions in live trading.

**No Financial Obligation**: Trades executed during mock sessions will not result in any fund pay-in or pay-out, allowing members to test without financial risk.
