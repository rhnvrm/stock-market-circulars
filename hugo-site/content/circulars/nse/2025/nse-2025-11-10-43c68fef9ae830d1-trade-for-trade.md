## Summary

NSE has issued surveillance measures to shift 6 securities from the rolling segment to the Trade for Trade (T2T) segment with a 5% or lower price band, effective November 13, 2025.

Settlement will be on a trade-to-trade basis with no netting off allowed. Additionally, 3 securities will continue in the T2T segment.
