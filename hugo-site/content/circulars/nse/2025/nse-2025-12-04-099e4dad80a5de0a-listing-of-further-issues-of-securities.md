## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. These are preferential issues in the SME segment with substantial lock-in periods, limiting immediate trading activity and liquidity impact.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Standard listing procedures apply. Trading members need to update their systems with new lot sizes and security identifiers.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to existing shareholders and preferential allottees. Lock-in periods restrict immediate trading for allottees. Continental Seeds shares locked until June 2027 (approximately 18 months), Pramara Promotions until June 2026 (approximately 6 months).

**Liquidity Considerations**: The preferential allotments represent additional shares but with lock-in restrictions. Market lots are relatively large (3,333 for CONTI), which may affect retail participation.
