## Summary

NSE has postponed the final migration date for its revamped NMF (NSE Mutual Fund) platform from July 31, 2025 to August 22, 2025, following multiple representations from members. This is the final extension with no further delays permitted.

## Key Points

- No further extensions will be granted beyond August 22, 2025
- Existing user interface, file formats, API specifications and reports will be discontinued
- Members must migrate to NSE MF Invest APIs

## Regulatory Changes

- Complete discontinuation of current NMF platform interface and specifications
- Mandatory migration to new NSE MF Invest platform
- New API specifications must be implemented by all connecting members

## Compliance Requirements

- All members connecting via API (in-house or through software vendors) must complete development and ensure compliance with NSE MF Invest APIs by August 22, 2025
- Mutual Fund Distributors, Registered Investment Advisors, and PMS providers must migrate to new platform
- Members requiring UAT access should contact NSE support

## Important Dates
