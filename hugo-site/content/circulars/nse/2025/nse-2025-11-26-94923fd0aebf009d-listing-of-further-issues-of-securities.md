## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. These are routine ESOP allotments representing small increases in paid-up capital across multiple companies. The absence of lock-in periods means shares are immediately tradeable, but the quantities are relatively small compared to the free float of these established companies. No expected impact on stock prices or trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders experience minor dilution. ESOP beneficiaries gain liquidity immediately with no lock-in restrictions.

**Compliance Impact**: None for market participants. This is an informational circular confirming completion of listing formalities by the respective companies.
