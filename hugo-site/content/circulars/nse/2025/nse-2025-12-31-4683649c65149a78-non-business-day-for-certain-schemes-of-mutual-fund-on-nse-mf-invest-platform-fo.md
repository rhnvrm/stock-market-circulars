title: Non-Business Day for certain schemes of Mutual Fund on NSE MF Invest Platform
  for January 2026
---

## Summary

NSE has notified members about non-business days for certain mutual fund schemes available on the NSE MF Invest Platform during January 2026. The affected schemes include various international equity funds from Nippon India and PGIM India. On these designated non-business days, all transaction types including subscriptions, redemptions, switches, SIPs, STPs, and SWPs will not be permitted through the platform.

## Key Points

- Non-business days declared for select Nippon India and PGIM India mutual fund schemes
- Affected schemes primarily include US Equity, Japan Equity, Taiwan Equity, Global Equity, Emerging Markets, and Real Estate Securities funds
- All transaction types suspended on non-business days: subscriptions, redemptions, switches, SIPs, STPs, and SWPs
- Circular issued by NSE NMF TM Segment (Circular Ref. No: 1089/2025)
- Notification based on communication received from respective mutual funds

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational notification regarding scheduled non-business days for specific mutual fund schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must note the non-business days for affected schemes
- Members should ensure no transactions are processed for listed schemes on specified dates
- Platform will automatically restrict transactions on non-business days

## Important Dates

**Nippon India Schemes:**
- January 1, 2026: US Equity Opportunities Fund (all variants), Taiwan Equity Fund (all variants)
- January 2, 2026: Japan Equity Fund (all variants)
- January 19, 2026: Japan Equity Fund (all variants - second occurrence)

**PGIM India Schemes:**
- January 1, 2026: Global Equity Opportunities FoF, Emerging Markets Equity FoF, Global Select Real Estate Securities FoF (all variants)

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact:** Minimal to low. Investors in the affected international equity schemes will be unable to transact on specific dates in January 2026. This appears to align with international market holidays (New Year's Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day on January 19).

**Market Impact:** Negligible. The restriction applies only to specific international fund-of-funds and international equity schemes, representing a small subset of available mutual fund products.

**Operational Impact:** Standard operational adjustment. The NSE platform will automatically prevent transactions on designated dates, requiring no manual intervention from members or investors.
