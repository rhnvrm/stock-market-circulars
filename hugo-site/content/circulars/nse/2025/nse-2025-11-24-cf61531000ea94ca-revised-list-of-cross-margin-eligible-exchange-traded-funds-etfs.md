## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued a revised list of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) eligible for cross margining benefits in the Futures & Options segment. The updated list will be effective from November 26, 2025, and supersedes the previous circular dated October 27, 2025. The list includes 65 ETFs from various fund houses covering major indices like Nifty 50, Bank Nifty, sectoral indices, and thematic funds, each with specified minimum quantity requirements.

## Regulatory Changes

This circular updates the list of ETFs eligible for cross margin benefits. Cross margining is a risk management mechanism that recognizes the offsetting nature of positions across different segments (cash and derivatives) and provides margin benefits by reducing the overall margin requirement. The inclusion or exclusion of specific ETFs impacts which securities can avail these benefits.

- Positions must be maintained in multiples of the specified minimum quantities
- Members should update their risk management systems with the revised list effective November 26, 2025
- Only the listed ETFs are eligible for cross margining benefits in the F&O segment

## Impact Assessment
