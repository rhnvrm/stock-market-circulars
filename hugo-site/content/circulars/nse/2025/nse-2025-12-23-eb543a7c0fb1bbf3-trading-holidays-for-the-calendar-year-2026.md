- Muhurat Trading provides a special trading opportunity on Diwali Laxmi Pujan despite it being a Sunday

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members must ensure their systems and operations are prepared for the holiday schedule
- Risk management and position monitoring need to account for extended non-trading periods around holiday clusters (e.g., March-April has 6 holidays)
- Settlement cycles and margin requirements should be planned considering the holiday calendar

**Planning Considerations:**
- Multiple holidays in March-April period (6 holidays) and October-November period (4 holidays) require careful position management
- Currency market participants engaged in cross-border transactions should coordinate with international market schedules
