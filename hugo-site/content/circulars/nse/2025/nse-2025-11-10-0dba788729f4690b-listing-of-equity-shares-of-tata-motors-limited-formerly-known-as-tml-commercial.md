## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** This demerger represents a major corporate restructuring of India's largest automobile manufacturer, splitting passenger and commercial vehicle businesses into separate listed entities. The listing of 3.68 billion shares will create significant trading volume and market capitalization changes.

**Shareholder Impact:** Existing TMPVL shareholders will receive proportionate shareholding in the demerged TML entity on a 1:1 basis, maintaining their economic interest across both entities. No dilution occurs as shares are issued in the same proportion.

**Operational Impact:** The demerger allows focused management and strategic direction for commercial vehicle operations. Separate listing provides operational independence, dedicated capital allocation, and distinct valuation metrics for the commercial vehicle business.

**Trading Impact:** Initial Trade-for-Trade (BE series) classification may limit liquidity temporarily until shift to EQ series. Market participants need to update systems for the new TMCV symbol and ISIN.
