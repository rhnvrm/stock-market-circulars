## Regulatory Changes

This circular partially modifies NSE/FAOP/71383 dated November 20, 2025, specifically revising mock trading timings. It implements the Pre-Open Session in Equity Derivatives (F&O) Segment as announced in circular NSE/FAOP/71092 dated November 03, 2025. The Exchange enforces a mandatory version migration policy requiring all members to discontinue NEAT+ 7.8.5 after the November 22, 2025 mock session.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Mandatory Software Upgrade**: Members must download and install NEAT+ version 7.8.6 from NSE Extranet path /faoftp/faocommon/NEATPlus786 before the mock session
- **Active Participation**: Members are strongly encouraged to participate actively in all three trading sessions
- **Pre-Open Testing**: Members must use NEAT+ 7.8.6 to place orders during Pre-Open session in Trading Session-1
- **Version Usage**: From November 22, 2025 onwards, only NEAT+ versions 7.8.4 and 7.8.6 will be supported
- **Master File Access**: Members should download master files (contract.gz, NSE_FO_contract_22112025.csv) from NSE Extranet path /faoftp/faocommon/Mock/22Nov2025 by 08:30 hrs on November 22, 2025

## Important Dates

- **November 21, 2025, 19:00 hrs**: NEAT+ version 7.8.6 available for download
- **November 22, 2025**: Mock trading session and NEAT+ 7.8.5 discontinuation date
  - Trading Session-1: 09:00-11:10 hrs (with Pre-Open)
  - Trading Session-2: 14:15-15:15 hrs (without Pre-Open)
  - Trading Session-3: 16:00-16:40 hrs (DR Site, without Pre-Open)
  - Live Re-login: 17:30-18:00 hrs
- **December 06, 2025**: Scheduled discontinuation date for NEAT+ version 7.8.4 (mock)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: All F&O trading members must complete technical upgrades and participate in comprehensive testing. The three-session mock structure requires significant resource allocation for Saturday operations. Members failing to upgrade will lose trading capability after November 22, 2025.

**Market Operations Impact**: Introduction of Pre-Open session in F&O segment represents a significant workflow change for November and December futures contracts. The staggered session approach allows thorough testing of both Pre-Open and regular trading scenarios, including disaster recovery site operations.

**Technical Impact**: Version migration affects all NEAT+ users, requiring installation, configuration, and testing. The 30-minute live re-login window provides limited time for issue resolution. Members must ensure compatibility and familiarize themselves with any interface or functionality changes in version 7.8.6.

**Risk Mitigation**: The mock session structure minimizes live market disruption by testing new features in a controlled environment. However, members face operational risk if they don't adequately prepare or encounter technical issues during the transition.
