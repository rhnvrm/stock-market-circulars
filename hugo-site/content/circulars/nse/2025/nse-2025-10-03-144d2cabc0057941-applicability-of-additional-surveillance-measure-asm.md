title: Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - New Securities Added to Long-Term ASM
  Framework
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework, adding Vineet Laboratories Limited to Long-Term ASM Stage-I and moving Stallion India Fluorochemicals Limited from Stage-I to Stage-II. A 100% margin rate will apply to all open positions and new positions in these securities from October 08, 2025. No securities were added to or moved to Stage-IV (which would trigger shift to Trade-for-Trade segment).

## Key Points

- Vineet Laboratories Limited (VINEETLAB, ISIN: INE505Y01010) shortlisted in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I effective October 06, 2025
- Stallion India Fluorochemicals Limited (STALLION, ISIN: INE0RYC01010) moved from Stage-I to Stage-II effective October 06, 2025
- No securities in Stage-IV or moving to Stage-IV in this update
- 100% margin requirement applies to both existing and new positions
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the companies

## Regulatory Changes

Mandatory 100% margin on affected securities under Long-Term ASM framework. Securities qualifying under criteria VII (Stage-IV) would be shifted from Rolling Settlement (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE), but no securities met this criteria in the current update.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure 100% margin collection on all open positions as on October 07, 2025
- 100% margin required on all new positions created from October 08, 2025 onwards
- Members must monitor ASM framework updates and adjust risk management accordingly
- Price bands will be reinstated to pre-ASM levels when securities exit the framework, subject to no other surveillance measures being applicable

## Important Dates

- **October 03, 2025**: Circular issued (Ref: 768/2025)
- **October 06, 2025**: Securities shortlisted/moved in ASM framework become effective
- **October 07, 2025**: Last day before margin changes apply
- **October 08, 2025**: 100% margin requirement effective on all positions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for trading these securities, likely reducing liquidity and trading volumes. This measure aims to curb excessive speculation and volatility.

**Operational Impact**: High - Brokers must adjust margin collection systems and communicate requirements to clients. Traders holding positions must arrange for additional margin or square off positions.

**Affected Securities**: 2 securities (1 newly added to Stage-I, 1 moved from Stage-I to Stage-II)

**Investor Impact**: Investors and traders in VINEETLAB and STALLION face substantially higher margin requirements, making leveraged trading unfeasible. Cash market trading remains possible but with full upfront payment required.
