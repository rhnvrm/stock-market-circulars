title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - Long Term Framework
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework, adding three securities to Long Term ASM Stage-I and moving one security from Stage-I to Stage-II, effective December 30, 2025. A 100% margin requirement will apply on all positions from January 1, 2026. This circular references previous ASM circulars and emphasizes that ASM is a market surveillance measure and not an adverse action against the companies.

## Key Points

- Three securities added to Long Term ASM Framework Stage-I: Essen Speciality Films Limited (ESFL), Madhav Copper Limited (MCL), and Sadhana Nitrochem Limited (SADHNANIQ)
- ESFL has been moved from Short Term ASM (STASM) to Long Term ASM (LTASM) framework
- Uravi Defence and Technology Limited (URAVIDEF) moved from Stage-I to Stage-II
- 100% margin applicable on all open positions as of December 31, 2025 and new positions from January 1, 2026
- No securities shifted to Stage-IV or Trade-for-Trade segment in this circular
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Securities under Stage-IV would be shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ) to Trade-for-Trade (BE) segment

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework continues with established stages (I through IV) as per previous circulars dating back to October 2018. Securities qualifying under Criteria VII (Stage-IV) would be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE), though no securities met this criterion in the current update.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain 100% margin on all positions in the affected securities from January 1, 2026
- The margin requirement applies to both existing open positions as of December 31, 2025 and all new positions created from January 1, 2026 onwards
- Members must treat this as a surveillance measure operating alongside other existing surveillance frameworks
- For queries, members should contact surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **December 29, 2025**: Circular issued
- **December 30, 2025**: Securities shortlisted under Long Term ASM framework become effective
- **December 31, 2025**: Last day before 100% margin applies to open positions
- **January 1, 2026**: 100% margin requirement becomes effective on all open and new positions

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Affected Securities**: The 100% margin requirement significantly reduces leverage availability for traders in ESFL, MCL, SADHNANIQ, and URAVIDEF. This will likely reduce trading volumes and liquidity in these securities.

**ESFL Escalation**: The movement of Essen Speciality Films Limited from Short Term to Long Term ASM indicates persistent surveillance concerns, suggesting ongoing volatility or unusual trading patterns.

**Stage Progression**: URAVIDEF's movement from Stage-I to Stage-II indicates continuing surveillance concerns. Further stage progression could eventually lead to Trade-for-Trade segment placement.

**Market Participants**: Brokers and traders holding positions in these securities must arrange for full margin funding, which may necessitate position unwinding or additional capital deployment.
