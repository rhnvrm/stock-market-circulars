- Higher lot size (1,000 shares) compared to mainboard may limit retail participation

- Significant portion of shares under lock-in reduces immediate free float
- Trade for Trade settlement requires full upfront payment/delivery
- SME platform carries higher risk profile compared to mainboard listings
