  - TRANSTEEL: June 30, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal market-wide impact as this involves routine listing of preferential allotments in the SME segment with relatively small issuance sizes.

**Company-Specific Impact**: 
- BIRDYS: 3.42% increase in equity base (200,000 new shares)
- MAGSON: 4.71% increase in equity base (460,208 new shares)  
- TRANSTEEL: 0.42% increase in equity base (91,500 new shares)

**Liquidity**: Limited immediate trading impact due to lock-in periods ranging from 7-19 months. Shares currently credited under temporary ISINs pending permanent ISIN activation per SEBI guidelines.

**Investor Considerations**: Investors should note the lock-in schedules and that these are preferential allotments at prices significantly different from potential market prices.
