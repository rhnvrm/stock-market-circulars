- Regulation 2.5.5 of NSE (Capital Market) Trading Regulations Part A for lot size specification

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: August 20, 2025
- **Listing Date**: December 03, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: June 30, 2026
- **Circular Effective Date**: December 03, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine preferential allotment listing for an SME segment company. The addition of 4.96 million shares represents a further issue that will increase the tradable float after the lock-in period expires.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Trading members need to note the availability of these securities from December 03, 2025. The shares are subject to lock-in until June 30, 2026, limiting immediate trading activity.

**Liquidity Impact**: The shares are pari passu with existing equity, but the lock-in restriction until June 30, 2026, means these shares will not contribute to immediate market liquidity. Post lock-in, the increased float may marginally improve liquidity for the counter.
