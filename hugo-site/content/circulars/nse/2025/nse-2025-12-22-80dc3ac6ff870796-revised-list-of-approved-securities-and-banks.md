## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to medium. This is a routine administrative update that provides clarity on eligible collateral securities. The inclusion of 40+ major large-cap stocks ensures adequate liquidity and choice for members.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to review their current collateral holdings against the updated list and ensure compliance with concentration limits and permitted quantities. The VAR-based haircut approach provides risk-appropriate margining.

**Sectoral Coverage:** The approved list provides diversified sectoral representation including financials (HDFCBANK, ICICIBANK, AXISBANK, KOTAKBANK, SBIN), technology (INFY, HCLTECH), energy (RELIANCE, ONGC, NTPC, COALINDIA), automotive (MARUTI, M&M, BAJAJ-AUTO, EICHERMOT), and consumer goods (ITC, HINDUNILVR, NESTLEIND, ASIANPAINT).
