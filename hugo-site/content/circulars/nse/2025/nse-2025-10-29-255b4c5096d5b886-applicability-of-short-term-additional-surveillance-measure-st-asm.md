- Total 30 securities now under ST-ASM Stage-I surveillance

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework is a surveillance mechanism to monitor securities showing abnormal price movements or trading patterns. Securities under this framework are subject to additional margin requirements and trading restrictions to protect investor interests.

### Securities Added to ST-ASM Stage-I:

1. **Bhagyanagar India Limited** (BHAGYANGR) - INE458B01036
2. **Bharat Wire Ropes Limited** (BHARATWIRE) - INE316L01019
3. **Hatsun Agro Product Limited** (HATSUN) - INE473B01035
4. **IFB Agro Industries Limited** (IFBAGRO) - INE076C01018

### Securities Excluded from ASM:

1. **ATC Energies System Limited** (ATCENERGY) - INE0V0Q01019
2. **Electro Force (India) Limited** (EFORCE) - INE0Q1W01012 - Moved to LT-ASM framework

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with additional surveillance measures for listed securities
- Enhanced margin requirements apply to securities under ST-ASM framework
- Investors should be aware of the surveillance status before trading in these securities
- Brokers must communicate the surveillance status to their clients

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 30, 2025 - ST-ASM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of four securities to ST-ASM Stage-I indicates NSE's concerns about price volatility or unusual trading patterns in these stocks. Traders and investors in these securities will face higher margin requirements and increased scrutiny.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ST-ASM typically experience:
- Higher margin requirements
- Reduced leverage availability
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Potential impact on liquidity

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of the enhanced surveillance measures and adjust their trading strategies accordingly. The framework aims to protect investors from excessive speculation and price manipulation.

## Consolidated ASM List

The complete list of 30 securities currently under ST-ASM Stage-I includes both newly added and existing securities across various sectors including infrastructure, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, retail, construction, and manufacturing.
