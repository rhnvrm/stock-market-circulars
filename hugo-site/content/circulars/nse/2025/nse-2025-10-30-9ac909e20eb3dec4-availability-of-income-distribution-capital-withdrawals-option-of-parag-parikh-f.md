## Impact Assessment

This is a low-impact operational update that expands investment options for NSE MF Invest Platform users. Exchange members are only required to take note of the new scheme options. The introduction of IDCW options provides investors with additional flexibility to choose between capital appreciation (existing growth options) and periodic income distribution. No action is required from members beyond awareness of the new product availability on the platform.
