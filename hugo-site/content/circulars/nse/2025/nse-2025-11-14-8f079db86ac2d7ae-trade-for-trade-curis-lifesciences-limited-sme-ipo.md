This follows the earlier circular NSE/CML/71278 dated November 13, 2025 and is in accordance with SEBI guidelines issued via circular CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012.

## Key Points

- Security Symbol: CURIS (Curis Lifesciences Limited)
- Transfer from: Trade for Trade segment (Series: ST)
- Transfer to: Rolling segment (Series: SM)
- Effective Date: November 28, 2025
- Issued pursuant to SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012
- Reference to prior circular NSE/CML/71278 dated November 13, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the standard regulatory framework for SME IPO securities transitioning from trade-for-trade settlement to rolling settlement. The change aligns with SEBI's guidelines on market operations and settlement mechanisms for newly listed securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must note the segment change for CURIS securities
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new series designation (SM instead of ST)
- Market participants must be prepared for rolling settlement procedures for CURIS effective November 28, 2025

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date:** November 14, 2025
- **Effective Date of Segment Transfer:** November 28, 2025
- **Reference Circular Date:** November 13, 2025 (NSE/CML/71278)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine procedural change affecting a single SME security. The transfer from trade-for-trade to rolling segment is a standard post-IPO procedure that indicates the security is moving to normal trading operations.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal - Trading members need to update internal systems to reflect the series change from ST to SM. The rolling segment allows for intraday trading and standard settlement cycles, which may increase liquidity for the security.

**Investor Impact:** Positive - The move to rolling segment typically provides better liquidity and more flexible trading opportunities for investors compared to the restrictive trade-for-trade segment.
