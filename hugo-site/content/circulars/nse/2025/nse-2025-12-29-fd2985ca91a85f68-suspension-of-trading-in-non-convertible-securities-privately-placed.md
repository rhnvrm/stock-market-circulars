All three securities are being suspended due to redemption.

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected as this is a routine administrative action for privately placed debt securities reaching redemption. The suspension affects only holders of these specific NCDs who would have been anticipating redemption. No impact on equity markets or broader debt market operations. The affected issuers are well-established entities (state power transmission company, NBFC, and power finance corporation), and the redemptions represent normal maturity events rather than distress situations.
