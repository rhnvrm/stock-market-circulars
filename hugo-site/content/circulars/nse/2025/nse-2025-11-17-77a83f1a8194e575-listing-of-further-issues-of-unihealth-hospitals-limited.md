- **Date of allotment**: September 8, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a small additional issue of 100,000 shares on the SME platform representing warrant conversion from preferential allotment.

**Liquidity Impact**: Limited immediate impact due to lock-in period extending until May 29, 2027. These shares cannot be traded freely until the lock-in expires.

**Operational Impact**: Standard listing process with no changes to trading mechanisms. The temporary ISIN arrangement is routine for additional issues pending permanent ISIN activation.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may see minor dilution. The preferential allotment nature and extended lock-in period suggest promoter or strategic investor participation.
