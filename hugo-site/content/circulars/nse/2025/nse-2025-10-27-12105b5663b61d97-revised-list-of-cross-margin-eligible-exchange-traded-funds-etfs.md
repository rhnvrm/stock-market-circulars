This circular supersedes the previous list issued on September 29, 2025 (circular no. 0127/2025). The updated list includes 60+ ETFs across various indices including Nifty 50, Bank Nifty, sectoral indices, and thematic funds, with specified minimum quantity requirements for each ETF.

Cross margining allows members to offset their ETF positions in the cash segment against F&O positions, resulting in reduced margin requirements. The regulatory framework remains unchanged; only the list of eligible securities has been updated.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must hold the specified minimum quantities (or multiples thereof) to avail cross margin benefits
- Applicable to all members trading in Futures & Options segment
- Members should update their risk management systems to reflect the revised eligible ETF list
- Minimum quantity requirements must be strictly adhered to for margin benefit calculation

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date:** October 27, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 29, 2025
- **Previous Circular Date:** September 29, 2025 (Circular no. 0127/2025, Reference: NCL/CMPT/70496)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Members with positions in the listed ETFs and corresponding F&O positions can optimize their margin utilization starting October 29, 2025. The revised list provides clarity on eligible securities and standardizes margin benefit calculations across the exchange.

**Market Impact:** Low to medium impact. This is primarily an operational benefit for members already active in both cash and derivatives segments. The inclusion of 60+ ETFs provides broader opportunities for margin optimization across different market segments and investment themes.

**Member Benefits:** Improved capital efficiency through reduced margin requirements when holding offsetting positions. The diverse list covering Nifty indices, sectoral themes, and market cap segments provides flexibility for different trading strategies.
