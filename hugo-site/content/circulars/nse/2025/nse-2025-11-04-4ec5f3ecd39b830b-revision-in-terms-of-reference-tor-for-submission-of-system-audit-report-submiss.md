title: Revision in Terms of Reference (TOR) for submission of system audit report
  & submission of Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) report for
  Vendors providing Co-Location as a Service (CaaS) facility
---

## Summary

NSE has revised the Terms of Reference (TOR) for system audit reports and introduced mandatory Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) report submission requirements for vendors providing Co-Location as a Service (CaaS) facility. The circular outlines comprehensive system details, security requirements, change management protocols, and traffic monitoring obligations that CaaS vendors must comply with to ensure system integrity, data confidentiality, and protection of trading member information.

## Key Points

- Mandatory system audit requirements covering hardware/software reconciliation, architecture documentation, and version control
- System redundancy, fault tolerance, load balancing, and database redundancy (hot/cold standby) provisions required
- Comprehensive security requirements including physical access controls, authentication technology, and audit trails
- Change management: All hardware/software changes must be tested during mock/simulation market in coordination with NSE COLO support
- Changes during market hours restricted to emergency situations only
- Traffic monitoring: CaaS vendors must monitor traffic from their infrastructure and prevent spurious/unwanted traffic to Exchange
- Trading member data must be maintained confidentially without third-party access, separately for each member
- 24x7 call center/help desk facilities mandatory for clients
- Alternate communication channels with OTP authentication required for disaster scenarios

## Regulatory Changes

- Updated Terms of Reference (TOR) for system audit as per Annexure A
- Introduction of mandatory VAPT report submission requirement for CaaS vendors
- Reference to previous NSE circulars NSE/MSD/59764 dated December 14, 2023 and NSE/MSD/60456 dated January 30, 2024 for change management and traffic monitoring compliance verification
- Enhanced security requirements as per Annexure 1 of circular NSE/MSD/37707
- Stricter change management protocols requiring NSE coordination and testing during mock/simulation markets

## Compliance Requirements

**For CaaS Vendors:**

- Conduct periodic reconciliation audits for all hardware and software assets
- Maintain detailed System Architecture, Application Architecture, and Network diagrams with periodic review and version control
- Implement system redundancy, fault tolerance, load balancing, and database redundancy
- Provide system capacity monitoring and scalability provisions
- Establish backup systems and data storage provisions
- Document contingency planning for technical failures and capacity planning
- Ensure trading member data confidentiality with separate, independent maintenance for each member
- Provide alternate communication channels with OTP authentication capability
- Operate 24x7 call center/help desk facilities
- Test all new hardware/software additions/changes during mock or simulation market in coordination with NSE COLO support
- Inform NSE before conducting any tests
- Monitor traffic originating from IT infrastructure and implement controls to prevent spurious/unwanted traffic
- Restrict physical access to critical systems to authorized officials only
- Supervise outsourced staff/visitor access with accompaniment by authorized employees
- Implement access control monitoring and audit trails for all staff access
- Provide second user reconfirmation for critical functions

**For System Auditors:**

- Verify test results including NSE communication, testing scenarios, system performance parameters, and testing results
- Verify compliance with NSE circulars NSE/MSD/59764 and NSE/MSD/60456
- Verify traffic monitoring controls and compliance
- Audit security requirements as per Annexure 1 of circular NSE/MSD/37707

## Important Dates

No specific deadlines mentioned in the provided content. Implementation appears to be immediate upon circular issuance on November 4, 2025.

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on CaaS Vendors:**

- Significant compliance burden with comprehensive system audit and VAPT reporting requirements
- Operational impact requiring coordination with NSE for all system changes and testing
- Investment required in infrastructure for redundancy, monitoring, security controls, and 24x7 support facilities
- Restriction on changes during market hours may affect operational flexibility
- Enhanced security and access control measures require process and technology upgrades

**Positive Impact on Trading Members:**

- Improved data security and confidentiality protections
- Enhanced system reliability through redundancy and fault tolerance requirements
- Better disaster recovery capabilities with alternate communication channels
- 24x7 support availability

**Market Integrity Impact:**

- Strengthened infrastructure security reduces systemic risks
- Traffic monitoring controls prevent potential market disruptions from spurious traffic
- Change management protocols ensure tested, stable systems during trading hours
- Overall enhancement of co-location facility reliability and security posture
