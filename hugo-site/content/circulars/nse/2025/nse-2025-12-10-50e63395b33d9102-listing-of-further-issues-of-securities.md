## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. These are routine ESOP allotments with relatively small share counts across multiple companies. The largest allotment is ICICI Bank with 503,178 shares, which represents negligible dilution given the bank's large equity base.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible impact on overall liquidity for these securities.

**Operational Impact**: Standard listing process with no special trading restrictions or procedures required.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders experience minimal dilution. ESOP shares are typically subject to vesting schedules and may not immediately enter the market for trading.
