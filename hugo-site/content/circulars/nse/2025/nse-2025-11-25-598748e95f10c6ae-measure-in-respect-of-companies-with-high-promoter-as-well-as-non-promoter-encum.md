## Important Dates

- **November 25, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 26, 2025**: Securities in Annexure II (Nil) eligible to move out from framework
- **November 27, 2025**: Last day before margin requirement applies to open positions
- **November 28, 2025**: 75% margin requirement becomes effective for Bedmutha Industries Limited on all open positions and new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The 75% margin requirement significantly increases the capital needed to trade these securities, likely reducing liquidity and trading volumes in affected stocks.

**Affected Securities**:
1. Bedmutha Industries Limited (BEDMUTHA) - Newly added
2. B. L. Kashyap and Sons Limited (BLKASHYAP) - Previously under measure
3. N R Agarwal Industries Limited (NRAIL) - Previously under measure

**Market Participants**: Traders and investors holding positions in these securities must arrange for additional margin funds or reduce positions. The measure may deter speculative trading while protecting investors from potential risks associated with high encumbrance levels.

**Risk Mitigation**: The measure addresses investor protection concerns arising from high encumbrance of both promoter and non-promoter holdings, which could indicate financial stress or potential liquidity issues at the company level.
