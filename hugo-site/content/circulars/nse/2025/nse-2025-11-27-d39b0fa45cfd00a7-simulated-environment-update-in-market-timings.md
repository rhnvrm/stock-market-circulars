## Summary

NSE has updated the market timings for its simulated environment to provide members with early access for testing purposes. The changes will be effective from December 9, 2025, and modify timings across Cash Market (CM), Futures & Options (F&O), Currency Derivatives (CD), and Commodity Derivatives (CO) segments. This is a partial modification to circular NSE/MSD/67731 dated April 28, 2025.

## Key Points

- Simulated environment access moved earlier in the day to facilitate member testing
- Order entry period for CM segment starts at 16:00 hrs instead of 17:30 hrs
- F&O segment order entry begins at 16:00 hrs with random closure between 16:59 and 17:00
- Normal market simulation continues until 22:00 hrs for all segments
- Exchange helpdesk support available only until 19:30 hrs on regular trading days
- Changes synced with pre-open session introduction in F&O segment per circular NSE/FAOP/71092

## Compliance Requirements

- Members need to be aware of the pre-open session integration in F&O segment as per circular NSE/FAOP/71092

## Important Dates

- **November 27, 2025**: Circular issued
- **December 9, 2025**: New simulated environment timings become effective

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:**
Low - This change affects only the simulated/testing environment and does not impact actual trading operations. Members gain 90 minutes of additional early access for testing (16:00 hrs vs 17:30 hrs previously).

**Member Impact:**
Members can now conduct testing and simulations earlier in the day, providing more flexibility for system testing, order validation, and technology preparedness. However, Exchange helpdesk support remains limited to 19:30 hrs, which members should factor into their testing plans.

**Market Impact:**
None - This is purely a technical/testing environment change with no impact on live market operations or trading hours.
