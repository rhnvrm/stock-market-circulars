## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing represents routine ESOP allotments with relatively small quantities compared to existing equity base. The largest allotment is 1,075,100 shares for Ivalue Infosolutions Limited.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible immediate impact on liquidity as shares are allotted to employees under ESOP schemes and may be subject to vesting requirements despite no exchange-mandated lock-in.

**Shareholder Impact**: Dilutive effect on existing shareholders is minor given the small number of shares relative to total outstanding equity. Shares rank pari passu with existing equity, ensuring equal rights.

**Operational Impact**: No operational changes required. Securities will trade using existing symbols and infrastructure with market lot size of 1 share.
