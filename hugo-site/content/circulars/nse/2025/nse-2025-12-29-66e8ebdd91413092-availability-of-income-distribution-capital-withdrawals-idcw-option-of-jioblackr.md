## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is a routine product feature addition for mutual fund investors. The introduction of IDCW option provides additional flexibility for investors in JioBlackRock Liquid Fund seeking periodic income distribution rather than capital appreciation. This affects only mutual fund investors using NSE MF Invest Platform and has no direct impact on equity trading, listing operations, or broader market operations. The change is administrative in nature and expands investment choices within an existing liquid fund scheme.
