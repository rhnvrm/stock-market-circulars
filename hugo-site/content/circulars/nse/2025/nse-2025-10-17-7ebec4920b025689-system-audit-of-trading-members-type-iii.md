title: System Audit of Trading Members (Type-III) for Half Year Ending September 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has issued mandatory guidelines for system audit of trading members for the half-year period ending September 30, 2025. All trading members must appoint only NSE-empaneled auditors and submit audit plans, preliminary reports, and action taken reports by specified deadlines. The Exchange has introduced technology-based monitoring measures including mandatory geo-location capture during auditor visits to member premises.

## Key Points

- Trading members must conduct system audit for period ending September 30, 2025
- Only NSE-empaneled system auditors can be appointed (as per NSE/INSP/69631 dated August 12, 2025)
- Mandatory geo-location tracking during auditor's physical visits to trading member offices
- Auditors must log into NSE web portal using member's internet connectivity during visits
- Trading members using algorithmic trading or offering algorithmic trading facilities require half-yearly system audit
- Comprehensive audit trail documentation must be maintained for minimum 3 years
- System auditors must preserve working papers, logs, screenshots for minimum 3 years

## Regulatory Changes

- Exchange will only accept system audit reports certified by empaneled system auditors effective from half year ending September 30, 2025
- Introduction of mandatory geo-location capture mechanism for auditor visits
- Requirement for auditors to submit visit details including entry/exit times and persons interacted with via NSE ENIT portal
- Enhanced monitoring through technology-based measures as per SEBI Framework

## Compliance Requirements

1. **Auditor Selection**: Appoint only NSE-empaneled system auditors from the list available at https://inspection.nseindia.com/empanelment_auditor/auditor/viewEmpanelledAuditors/

2. **Audit Plan Submission**: Submit complete audit plan via NSE ENIT portal including:
   - Details of appointed auditor
   - List of systems to be audited
   - Trading member office locations to be visited
   - Geo-location details of office locations

3. **Physical Visit Protocol**: 
   - Auditor must log into Exchange web portal during physical visit using member's internet/network connectivity
   - No remote access to portal during physical visits
   - Submit all visit details including dates, entry/exit times, persons visited

4. **Record Maintenance**:
   - Trading members: Maintain records of audit team members for minimum 3 years
   - System auditors: Preserve working papers, logs, screenshots, visit records for minimum 3 years

5. **Algorithmic Trading**: Members using or offering algorithmic trading facilities must undergo half-yearly system audit

## Important Dates

- **November 07, 2025**: Deadline for submission of Audit Plan
- **November 30, 2025**: Deadline for submission of Preliminary Audit Report
- **February 28, 2026**: Deadline for submission of Action Taken Report (ATR) if applicable
- **Audit Period**: April 2025 - September 2025 (Half Yearly)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: High - Trading members must immediately engage empaneled auditors and complete audit planning by November 7, 2025. The geo-location tracking requirement adds operational complexity requiring coordination between members and auditors.

**Compliance Impact**: High - Mandatory compliance for all trading members. Failure to submit reports by deadlines may result in regulatory penalties or sanctions.

**Technology Impact**: Medium - Members must ensure their internet connectivity and systems support auditor access to NSE web portal for geo-location capture.

**Cost Impact**: Medium - Engagement of empaneled auditors and maintenance of 3-year audit documentation requires resource allocation.

**Regulatory Framework**: Based on SEBI Circulars CIR/MRD/DMS/34/2013, SEBI/HO/MIRSD/TPD/CIR/2025/10, and CIR/MRD/16/2013 establishing framework for monitoring and supervision through technology-based measures.
