## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing of further issues for two SME segment companies. The share counts are relatively small (42,346 for KRISHCA and 1,069,600 for ALPEXSOLAR) and both are subject to extended lock-in periods preventing immediate trading.

**Operational Impact**: Standard listing procedures apply. Trading members need to configure their systems with the specified security codes and lot sizes. The use of temporary ISINs is a standard compliance measure for additional issues.

**Investor Impact**: Limited immediate impact due to lock-in restrictions. KRISHCA shares are locked until May 2027 (approximately 18 months from listing date) while ALPEXSOLAR shares are locked until May 2026 (approximately 6 months from listing date). Investors should note the preferential nature of these allotments and the significant lock-in periods before these shares become freely tradable.
