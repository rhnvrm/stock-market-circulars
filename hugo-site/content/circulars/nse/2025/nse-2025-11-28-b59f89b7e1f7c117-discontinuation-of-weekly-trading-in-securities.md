title: Discontinuation of Weekly Trading in Kalahridhaan Trendz Limited
---

## Summary

NSE will discontinue the weekly trading restriction for Kalahridhaan Trendz Limited (KTL) effective December 16, 2025. The company had been under a restricted trading regime (Trade for Trade basis on Series "SZ") on the first trading day of every week for six months due to non-compliance with Regulation 76 of SEBI Depository Regulations regarding submission of Reconciliation of Share Capital Audit Report for two consecutive quarters (September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2024).

## Key Points

- Kalahridhaan Trendz Limited (Symbol: KTL) will exit weekly trading restrictions on December 16, 2025
- Company was penalized for non-submission of Reconciliation of Share Capital Audit Report for Q3 2024 and Q4 2024
- Trading was restricted to Trade for Trade basis (Series "SZ") on first trading day of each week
- Six-month mandated penalty period completes on December 16, 2025
- Violation relates to Regulation 76 of SEBI (Depository and Participants) Regulations, 2018

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular implements the completion of a penalty period as per existing SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024, which mandates a six-month period of weekly trading for companies suspended due to non-compliance with share capital reconciliation requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Market Participants:**
- Normal trading in KTL will resume from December 16, 2025 (after closing hours of December 15, 2025)
- No action required from members; change is automatic

**For Kalahridhaan Trendz Limited:**
- Company has completed the mandated six-month penalty period
- Must maintain compliance with Regulation 76 going forward to avoid future suspensions

## Important Dates

- **April 24, 2025**: Initial suspension circular issued (Ref. No. 0690/2025)
- **December 15, 2025**: Last day of weekly trading restrictions (closing hours)
- **December 16, 2025**: Effective date for discontinuation of weekly trading restrictions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. Kalahridhaan Trendz Limited is a small-cap company with limited trading volumes. The discontinuation of weekly trading restrictions will restore normal trading capabilities for the stock.

**Investor Impact:** Positive for existing KTL shareholders as it removes trading restrictions and improves liquidity. Investors will be able to trade the stock on all trading days instead of only the first trading day of each week.

**Operational Impact:** The stock will move from Series "SZ" (Trade for Trade) weekly trading to normal trading operations, improving accessibility and potentially enhancing liquidity.
