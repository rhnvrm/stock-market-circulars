## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The OFS involves significant sale of equity shares (45.76 lakh shares) of Keystone Realtors Limited, which may impact stock liquidity and price during the offer period.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure system readiness, admin user setup on eOFS platform, UCC compliance updates, and sufficient collateral margins. The strict timeline for UCC compliance (must be completed day prior) and the irreversibility of rejected orders due to margin insufficiency require careful preparation by members.

**Investor Impact**: Both retail (RS series - bid value ≤ Rs 2 lakhs) and non-retail (IS series) investors can participate. Non-retail investors have the facility to carry forward unallocated bids to T+1 day, subject to margin requirements.
