title: Market Wide Position Limits and Category-wise Limits for F&O Segment
---

## Summary

NSE has published updated position limits for the Futures & Options segment covering Market Wide Position Limits (MWPL) and category-specific limits for various participant types. The circular provides comprehensive position limit data for 42+ securities including limits for clients, proprietary trading, trading members, FPIs (Category I and II), and mutual funds.

## Key Points

- Market Wide Position Limits (MWPL) specified for each security in number of shares
- Separate position limits defined for client accounts and proprietary trading accounts
- Combined limits provided for Trading Members (Client + Proprietary), FPI Category I, and Mutual Funds
- FPI Category II limits split between institutional entities and individuals/family offices/corporates
- FPI Category II (institutional) limits are higher than FPI Category II (individuals/family offices/corporates)
- Covers major index constituents and actively traded F&O stocks across sectors
- Highest MWPL of 592 million shares for CIPLA, followed by 535.77 million for BEL
- Banking sector stocks like AXISBANK (296.37M), BAJFINANCE (317.52M), CANBK (504.31M) have substantial position limits

## Regulatory Changes

This circular provides updated position limit parameters that market participants must adhere to while trading in the F&O segment. The limits are structured to ensure:

- Risk management and prevention of concentration of positions
- Differentiated limits based on participant category and risk profile
- Lower limits for individual/retail-focused FPI entities compared to institutional FPIs
- Trading Member combined limits (Client + Proprietary) aligned with FPI Category I and MF limits

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure client positions do not exceed specified client limits
- Proprietary desks must monitor positions against proprietary limits (typically 2x client limits)
- Combined TM positions (client + proprietary) must stay within specified TM limits
- FPI Category I and Mutual Funds must adhere to the combined TM/FPI/MF limit column
- FPI Category II entities must comply with category-specific limits based on entity type
- Position monitoring required on real-time basis to prevent limit breaches
- Brokers responsible for pre-trade and post-trade position limit checks

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: December 22, 2025
- Effective Date: Immediate (limits applicable for ongoing trading)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - These limits directly affect trading capacity and strategies for all F&O participants. Large institutional traders and proprietary desks must structure their positions within these constraints.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update risk management systems with latest limit parameters. Position monitoring systems need to be configured with the updated limits to prevent inadvertent breaches.

**Strategic Impact:** Traders with large positions may need to adjust strategies if current holdings approach or exceed new limits. FPI Category II entities (individuals/family offices) face tighter restrictions compared to institutional FPIs, affecting their market access.

**Liquidity Impact:** Position limits can affect market depth and liquidity, particularly for stocks with lower MWPL values where fewer participants can hold significant positions.
