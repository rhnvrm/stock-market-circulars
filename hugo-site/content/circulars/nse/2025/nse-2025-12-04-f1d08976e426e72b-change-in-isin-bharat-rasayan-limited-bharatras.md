## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has announced a change in the ISIN code for equity shares of Bharat Rasayan Limited (Symbol: BHARATRAS). The new ISIN code INE838B01021 will be effective from December 12, 2025, following a stock sub-division from face value of Rs. 10/- to Rs. 5/- per share.

## Key Points

- Company affected: Bharat Rasayan Limited (BHARATRAS)
- New ISIN: INE838B01021
- Reason: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs. 10/- to Rs. 5/- face value
- Effective date: December 12, 2025 (Ex-date)
- All trades executed on or after the ex-date will use the new ISIN
- Circular reference number: 2351/2025
- NSE reference: NSE/CML/71625

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements a technical change to the securities identification system following a corporate action. The ISIN (International Securities Identification Number) change is mandatory to reflect the altered face value of equity shares post sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN code for BHARATRAS
- Trading systems must be configured to use the new ISIN INE838B01021 from December 12, 2025
- Members must ensure proper mapping and transition from the old ISIN to new ISIN in their back-office systems
- Settlement and clearing processes must account for the ISIN change from the ex-date

## Important Dates

- **December 04, 2025**: Circular issued
- **December 12, 2025**: Ex-date - New ISIN becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The stock sub-division will double the number of outstanding shares while halving the price per share, making the stock more accessible to retail investors. The ISIN change is a technical requirement that ensures proper identification and tracking of the subdivided shares.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members, custodians, and depositories must update their systems to handle the new ISIN. While this is a routine process, it requires coordination across all market participants to ensure seamless transition on the ex-date.

**Investor Impact**: Low to Medium - Existing shareholders will automatically receive additional shares in the 2:1 ratio (sub-division from Rs. 10 to Rs. 5). No action is required from investors, but they should be aware of the change in share count and price adjustment in their portfolios.
