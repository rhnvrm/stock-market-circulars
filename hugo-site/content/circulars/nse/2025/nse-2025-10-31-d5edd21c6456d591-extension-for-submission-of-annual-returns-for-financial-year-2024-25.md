---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has extended the deadline for submission of Annual Returns for Financial Year 2024-25 from October 31, 2025 to December 31, 2025. This extension follows the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) circular ref. 06/2025 dated October 17, 2025, which extended the due date for filing financial statements and annual returns with the Registrar of Companies (ROC) for the financial year ended March 31, 2025. Members must submit their returns through the ENIT portal on or before the new deadline.

## Key Points

- Original deadline of October 31, 2025 extended to December 31, 2025
- Extension applies to Annual Returns for Financial Year 2024-25 (ended March 31, 2025)
- MCA circular ref. 06/2025 dated October 17, 2025 provides the regulatory basis for this extension
- Submissions must be made through the ENIT portal at https://enit.nseindia.com/MemberPortal/
- Non-submission or delayed submission will attract penalties and disciplinary actions as per Exchange Circular NSE/INSP/70746 dated October 10, 2025
- This circular supersedes earlier circular NSE/COMP/70513 dated September 30, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) issued circular ref. 06/2025 on October 17, 2025, titled "Relaxation of Additional Fees and Extension of Time for Filing of Financial Statements and Annual Return under the Companies Act, 2013". This MCA circular extended the statutory filing deadline with the Registrar of Companies from October 31, 2025 to December 31, 2025 for financial year ended March 31, 2025. In alignment with this regulatory change, NSE has correspondingly extended its own deadline for members' Annual Return submissions.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must submit Annual Returns for Financial Year 2024-25 through the ENIT portal
- Portal access: https://enit.nseindia.com/MemberPortal/
- Submissions must be completed on or before December 31, 2025
- Members who fail to submit or submit late will face penalties and disciplinary actions as specified in Exchange Circular NSE/INSP/70746 dated October 10, 2025
- Members should ensure compliance with this extended deadline to avoid enforcement action

## Important Dates

- **October 17, 2025**: MCA issues circular extending ROC filing deadline
- **October 31, 2025**: Original deadline (now superseded)
- **December 31, 2025**: New extended deadline for Annual Return submissions for FY 2024-25
- **Financial Year covered**: April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This circular provides relief to NSE members by granting a two-month extension for compliance with Annual Return filing requirements. The extension aligns with the broader regulatory relief provided by MCA, ensuring consistency between statutory ROC filings and exchange-level reporting obligations. Members now have additional time to prepare and submit accurate returns without facing penalties. The extension does not affect market operations, trading activities, or investor-facing processes. Support is available through the NSE helpdesk at 1800 266 0050 (IVR option 3) or via email at memcompliance_support@nse.co.in for any submission-related queries.
