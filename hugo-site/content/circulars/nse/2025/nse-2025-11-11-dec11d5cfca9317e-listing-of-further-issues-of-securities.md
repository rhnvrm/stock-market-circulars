## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - The additional shares represent routine ESOP allotments and a minor release of bonus shares from abeyance. The quantities are relatively small compared to the free float of these companies and will have negligible impact on share prices or trading volumes.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - Standard listing procedure for further issues. Trading members need to update their systems with new distinctive number ranges, but no special operational changes required.

**Investor Impact**: Neutral - Minor dilution effect for existing shareholders. ESOP allotments are routine corporate actions. The ICICI Bank bonus shares from abeyance represent a very small quantity (175 shares) and will have no material impact.
