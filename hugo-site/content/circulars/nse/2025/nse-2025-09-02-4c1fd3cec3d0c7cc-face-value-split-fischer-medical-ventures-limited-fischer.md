## Summary

The National Stock Exchange has announced that Fischer Medical Ventures Limited (FISCHER) will undergo a face value split from Rs. 10 to Re. 1 per equity share. This 10:1 split will be effective from September 12, 2025, increasing the number of shares while proportionally reducing the price per share.

## Key Points

- Face value and paid-up value will change from Rs. 10 to Re. 1 per share
- The split ratio is 10:1 (each existing share will become 10 shares)
- No change in the total market capitalization or proportional ownership
- Trading with new face value begins September 12, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are involved. This is a standard corporate action that adjusts the face value of existing equity shares while maintaining the same total capital structure.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must update their systems to reflect the new face value
- Ensure trading systems are configured for the split-adjusted shares from the effective date
- Update client records to reflect the increased number of shares post-split

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: September 2, 2025
- **Effective Date**: September 12, 2025
- **Trading with New Face Value**: From September 12, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The face value split will increase share liquidity by reducing the per-share price, making the stock more accessible to retail investors. Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held, with no change in their proportional ownership or total investment value. Market systems and trading platforms will need to adjust for the new share count and price levels.
