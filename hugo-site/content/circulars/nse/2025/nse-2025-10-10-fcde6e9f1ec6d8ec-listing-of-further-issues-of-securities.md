## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. These are routine further issues representing relatively small increases in outstanding shares for most companies. The largest issuance is Centrum Capital with 43.5 million shares, while others range from 25,000 to 4.64 million shares.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact due to lock-in periods ranging from 6 months to 2+ years for most securities. Only Sai Life Sciences ESOP shares are immediately tradable without lock-in restrictions.

**Investor Considerations**: 
- Lock-in periods restrict immediate supply of these shares to the market
- All shares are pari passu, meaning they carry identical rights as existing equity
- Preferential allotments and warrant conversions typically involve promoters or strategic investors
- ESOP shares represent employee compensation and may see gradual market entry

**Operational Impact**: Standard administrative listing with no special trading arrangements or margin requirements specified.
