## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine administrative listing of ESOP shares that increases the free float marginally for each company. The share quantities are relatively small compared to total outstanding shares of these large-cap and mid-cap companies.

**Investor Impact**: Neutral. Existing shareholders experience minor dilution, but these are pre-disclosed ESOP allotments. No price impact expected as ESOP issuances are standard corporate actions.

**Trading Impact**: No impact on trading operations. Securities will trade normally with market lot of 1 share, consistent with existing practices for these scrips.
