The two-day extension provides additional time for prospective investors to subscribe to the DSP MSCI India ETF during the new fund offer period. The change only affects investors interested in participating in this particular NFO and does not impact broader market operations, existing securities, or trading activities. Members and investors have been provided adequate notice of the revised timeline and funding requirements.
