title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Addition of 3 Securities to Stage I
---

## Summary

NSE has included 3 securities under Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Stage I framework effective December 30-31, 2025. The affected securities are C P S Shapers Limited, Swaraj Suiting Limited, and Wol 3D India Limited. These securities will attract a minimum 100% margin requirement and will be shifted from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment. No securities are being excluded from the ESM framework or moving between stages.

## Key Points

- 3 new securities added to ESM Stage I: CPS (INE0QBU01012), SWARAJ (INE0GMR01016), and WOL3D (INE0OO201011)
- 100% margin requirement applies to all open positions as on December 30, 2025 and new positions from December 31, 2025
- Securities will shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST) from December 31, 2025
- CPS Shapers and Swaraj Suiting will move from EQ/SM to BE/ST series
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework (Annexure II is Nil)
- No securities moving between Stage I and Stage II
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

Enhanced Surveillance Measure implementation for the 3 securities includes:
- Shift to Trade-for-Trade settlement mechanism (no intraday squaring off allowed)
- Minimum 100% margin requirement on all positions
- Securities qualifying under ESM moved from series EQ/SM to BE/ST
- Framework is surveillance-based and not an adverse action against the companies

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure 100% margin is available for open positions in these securities as on December 30, 2025
- All new positions from December 31, 2025 require 100% upfront margin
- Trading members must adapt to Trade-for-Trade settlement for CPS and SWARAJ from December 31, 2025
- Members should review client positions and communicate margin requirements
- Queries can be directed to surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **December 29, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **December 30, 2025**: ESM Stage I inclusion effective date, 100% margin applies to existing open positions
- **December 31, 2025**: Securities shift from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment, 100% margin applies to all new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders and traders of the 3 affected securities. Trade-for-Trade mechanism will reduce liquidity and eliminate intraday trading opportunities.

**Trading Impact**: 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for taking positions. Traders cannot use leverage, impacting trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: Existing position holders must ensure sufficient margins by December 30, 2025 or face potential square-off. Buy-and-hold investors less affected but selling liquidity may be constrained.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers need to update risk management systems, communicate with clients holding these securities, and ensure margin collection compliance.
