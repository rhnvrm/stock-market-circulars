## Regulatory Changes

This circular continues the Exchange's GSM framework implementation as outlined in previous circulars NSE/SURV/34262 (February 23, 2017), NSE/SURV/38389 (July 20, 2018), NSE/SURV/42790 (November 29, 2019), NSE/SURV/59425 (November 17, 2023), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), and NSE/SURV/70168 (September 12, 2025).

The GSM framework has four stages with progressively stricter surveillance actions:
- **Stage I**: 100% margin rate and 5% or lower price band
- **Stage II**: Trade-for-trade with 5% or lower price band and 50% ASD from buyers
- **Stage III**: Trade-for-trade with 5% or lower price band, once-a-week trading, and 100% ASD from buyers
- **Stage IV**: Trade-for-trade with 5% or lower price band, once-a-week trading, 100% ASD from buyers, and no upward price movement

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must ensure compliance with trade-for-trade settlement requirements
- **Buyers**: Must deposit 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit of trade value
- **All Members**: Must take adequate precautions while trading in EUROTEXIND as settlement is on trade-to-trade basis with no netting off
- **Trading Schedule**: Trading only permitted on Mondays or the first trading day of each week
- **Price Movement**: No upward price movement allowed; only 5% or lower price band with downward or no movement

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: November 06, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 07, 2025 - EUROTEXIND moves to Stage IV GSM
- **Trading Days**: Every Monday or first trading day of the week starting November 07, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on EUROTEXIND**: The movement to Stage IV GSM represents the most severe surveillance action available under NSE's framework. This will significantly impact the security's liquidity and trading activity:

- **Liquidity Impact**: Severely constrained with trading allowed only once per week
- **Price Discovery**: Heavily restricted with no upward price movement permitted
- **Capital Requirements**: Buyers face 100% ASD requirement, effectively doubling capital needed for transactions
- **Settlement Risk**: Trade-to-trade settlement with no netting increases operational complexity
- **Investor Access**: Retail and institutional investors may avoid the security due to restrictive conditions
- **Market Confidence**: Stage IV placement typically signals serious concerns about the security's price behavior or corporate governance issues
