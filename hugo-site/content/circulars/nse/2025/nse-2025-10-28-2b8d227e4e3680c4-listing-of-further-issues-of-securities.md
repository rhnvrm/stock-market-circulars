The circular specifies security codes, ISIN numbers, face values, allotment details, and lock-in requirements for each company.

## Key Points

- Effective date: October 29, 2025
- All securities tradeable in market lot of 1 share
- Most issues are ESOP allotments with no lock-in requirements
- Associated Alcohols issued 900,000 shares via warrant conversion with lock-in until May 31, 2027
- Total securities across companies: ABSLAMC (16,824), Artemis Medicare (306,000), Associated Alcohols (900,000), Axis Bank (34,099), CARE Ratings (12,100), and others

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date:** October 28, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 29, 2025
- **Allotment Dates:**

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. The further issues represent incremental additions to existing share capital through routine corporate actions (ESOP exercises and warrant conversions). The quantum of shares is relatively small compared to the existing market capitalization of these companies, particularly for large banks like Axis Bank (34,099 shares) and ICICI Bank.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal. Trading members need to note the new distinctive number ranges for record-keeping purposes but no changes to trading mechanisms or systems are required.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible increase in free float, except for Associated Alcohols where 900,000 shares remain locked until 2027, temporarily reducing available supply.
