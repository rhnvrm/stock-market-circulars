title: Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - Securities Inclusion and Stage Movement
---

## Summary

NSE has announced the inclusion of securities under Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) effective September 10-12, 2025. Three securities will enter Stage-I ASM with 100% margin requirements, while one security will move from Stage-I to Stage-II. The measures are implemented as part of market surveillance framework to monitor securities that meet specific risk criteria.

## Key Points

- 100% margin requirement applicable on all open and new positions from September 12, 2025
- Three new securities added to Long-Term ASM Stage-I framework
- One security progressing from Stage-I to Stage-II
- Securities qualifying under Criteria VII would shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ) to Trade-for-Trade (BE) segment
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other existing surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

- Margin rate increased to 100% for specified securities
- Potential segment migration from EQ to BE series for Stage-IV securities (none currently affected)
- Enhanced surveillance monitoring for listed securities

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain 100% margin for affected securities
- Compliance with trade-for-trade settlement requirements where applicable
- Adherence to all prevailing surveillance measures in conjunction with ASM

## Important Dates

- **September 10, 2025**: ASM framework stages become effective
- **September 11, 2025**: Last day before margin increase on existing positions
- **September 12, 2025**: 100% margin requirement effective on all positions

## Impact Assessment

**Affected Securities:**
- **Stage-I New Entries**: A B Infrabuild Limited (ABINFRA), Jalan Transolutions (India) Limited (JALAN), Nakoda Group of Industries Limited (NGIL)
- **Stage Movement**: Laxmi Goldorna House Limited (LGHL) moving from Stage-I to Stage-II

The 100% margin requirement will significantly reduce leverage availability and may impact trading volumes and liquidity in these securities. The measure is surveillance-driven and should not be construed as adverse action against the companies.
