title: Ease of Doing Compliance - Submission of Action Taken Report for Non-Compliances
  in Internal Audit Report
---

## Summary

NSE has issued detailed guidelines on the electronic submission of Action Taken Reports (ATR) for non-compliances identified in internal audit reports. Trading members must close all non-compliances within 2 months from the end of the due date for submission of the Internal Audit Report. For the half-year ended September 30, 2025, the ATR submission deadline is January 31, 2026. The circular provides step-by-step procedures for submitting ATR through the Inspection module in the Member Portal and warns of monetary penalties and disciplinary actions for non-compliance.

## Key Points

- Action Taken Reports must be submitted electronically through the Inspection module in the Member Portal under the Internal Audit Tab
- Trading members have 2 months from the end of the internal audit report due date to close all non-compliances
- For H1 FY2025-26 (half-year ended September 30, 2025), ATR submission deadline is January 31, 2026
- Members must assign 'Internal Audit-ATR' role to auditors for ATR submission or create new sub-user login
- ATR is considered complete only after submission to Exchange and receipt of acknowledgment email
- ATR saved in system or submitted only by auditor will not be considered as final submission
- Reference to earlier circular NSE/INSP/71579 dated December 1, 2025
