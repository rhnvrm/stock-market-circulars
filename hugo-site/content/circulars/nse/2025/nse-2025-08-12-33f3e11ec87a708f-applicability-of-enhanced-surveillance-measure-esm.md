title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities Movement and New Inclusions
---

## Summary

NSE has updated its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework, introducing new securities under surveillance, moving existing securities between stages, and implementing stricter trading conditions. The changes include minimum 100% margin requirements and shift from rolling settlement to trade-for-trade segment for affected securities.

## Key Points

- MIRC Electronics Limited newly included in ESM Stage-I with immediate effect
- United Polyfab Gujarat Limited moves from ESM Stage-I to Stage-II
- Securities under ESM Stage-II will trade under Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band
- All ESM securities shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade (BE/ST) segment
- Minimum 100% margin required on all open and new positions
- No securities excluded from ESM framework in this update

## Regulatory Changes

- Securities qualifying under ESM moved from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST)
- Stage II securities placed under Trade for Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- Enhanced margin requirements of minimum 100% imposed on affected securities
- Framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure compliance with 100% margin requirements for ESM securities
- Trading in affected securities restricted to Trade-for-Trade segment only
- Stage II securities subject to Periodic Call Auction mechanism with price band restrictions
- Members must monitor and adjust positions according to new settlement procedures

## Important Dates

- **August 13, 2025**: ESM Stage transitions effective, Stage II securities under Periodic Call Auction begins
- **August 14, 2025**: 100% margin requirement effective on all open positions and new positions, EQ/SM to BE/ST segment shift effective

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact**: The implementation affects trading liquidity, margin requirements, and settlement procedures for multiple securities. The shift to trade-for-trade segment eliminates intraday trading opportunities and requires full payment/delivery. The 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for traders and investors in these securities. Stage II securities face additional restrictions through periodic call auction mechanism, further limiting trading flexibility.
