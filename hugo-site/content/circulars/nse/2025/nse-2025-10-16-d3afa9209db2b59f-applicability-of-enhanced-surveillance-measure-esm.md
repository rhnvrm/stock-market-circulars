## Summary

No new securities are being added to Stage-I, and no securities are being excluded from the ESM framework. The consolidated ESM list continues to include securities like Aarey Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Limited, ASL Industries Limited, Bafna Pharmaceuticals Limited, and Cura Technologies Limited in Stage-II.

## Key Points

- No new securities added to ESM Stage-I

- Securities under ESM attract minimum 100% margin on all positions
- Securities shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade (BE/ST) segment
- Stage-II securities placed under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

- Shift to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST) from Rolling Settlement
- 2% price band restriction under Periodic Call Auction mechanism

The circular references previous circulars: NSE/SURV/56948 (June 02, 2023), NSE/SURV/57609 (July 18, 2023), NSE/SURV/63361 (August 09, 2024), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), NSE/SURV/64400 (October 04, 2024), and NSE/SURV/69315 (July 25, 2025).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must apply 100% margin on MIRCELECTR effective October 20, 2025
- Margin applies to all open positions as on October 17, 2025
- Margin applies to all new positions created from October 20, 2025
- Securities can only be traded in Trade-for-Trade segment (no intraday trading)
- Settlement will be on T+1 basis with delivery mandatory
- Members should note ESM is a surveillance measure and not an adverse action against the company

## Important Dates

- **October 16, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **October 17, 2025**: Effective date for Stage-II movement (Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction begins)
- **October 20, 2025**: Effective date for 100% margin requirement and shift to BE/ST segment

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited market impact as only one security is moving to a more restrictive stage. No new securities are being added to ESM Stage-I, indicating stable market surveillance conditions.

**Trading Impact**: MIRCELECTR investors will face:
- Reduced liquidity due to Trade-for-Trade restrictions
- No intraday trading allowed
- Higher capital requirements due to 100% margin and delivery obligations
- Limited price movement (2% price band) under Periodic Call Auction
- Potential reduction in speculative trading activity

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders of MIRC Electronics will need to account for reduced trading flexibility and higher transaction costs. The ESM classification is surveillance-based and does not reflect company fundamentals.
