## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative circular with minimal market impact. The listing of ESOP-allotted shares represents small quantities relative to the total outstanding shares of these established companies. The immediate tradability (no lock-in) may result in minor supply increases, but given the small volumes involved, no significant price impact is expected. This reflects normal course of business for employee compensation programs.
