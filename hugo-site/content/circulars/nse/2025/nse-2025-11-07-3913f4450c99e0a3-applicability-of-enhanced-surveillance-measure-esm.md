## Summary

NSE has issued circular updating the list of securities under Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework. Five securities are being included in ESM Stage-I with 100% margin requirements and shift to Trade-for-Trade segment effective November 11, 2025. One security (VIJIFIN) is being moved from Stage-II to Stage-I. Securities moving to Stage-II will be under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction from November 10, 2025.

## Key Points

- Five new securities included in ESM Stage-I: Commercial Syn Bags Limited (COMSYN), E Factor Experiences Limited (EFACTOR), Fonebox Retail Limited (FONEBOX), Silly Monks Entertainment Limited (SILLYMONKS), and Sunlite Recycling Industries Limited (SUNLITE)
- All Stage-I securities will attract minimum 100% margin on all open positions as on November 10, 2025, and new positions from November 11, 2025
- Securities shifting from Rolling Settlement segment (EQ/SM series) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST series) effective November 11, 2025
- Viji Finance Limited (VIJIFIN) moving from ESM Stage-II to Stage-I effective November 10, 2025
- Stage-II securities will be under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction from November 10, 2025
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting under ESM is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework continues with the following key features:

- **Stage-I Requirements**: 100% margin requirement on all positions, shift to Trade-for-Trade segment
- **Stage-II Requirements**: Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- **Segment Shift**: Securities move from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade (BE/ST)
- **Price Band Restoration**: Securities moving out of ESM will have price bands reinstated to pre-ESM levels, unless under other surveillance measures

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**

- Settlement processes shift from rolling to Trade-for-Trade, requiring full upfront payment/delivery
- Risk management systems need updates to reflect new margin and trading restrictions

**Investor Impact:**
- Retail and institutional investors holding these securities face higher capital requirements (100% margin vs. typical 20-40%)
- Exit strategies may be constrained by reduced liquidity and Trade-for-Trade settlement
- Long-term investors may face challenges in position management

**Securities Affected:**
- **Stage-I Inclusions**: COMSYN, EFACTOR, FONEBOX, SILLYMONKS, SUNLITE (5 securities)
- **Stage Movement**: VIJIFIN (Stage-II to Stage-I)
