## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - This modification affects the valuation basis for the preferentially allotted shares of Jash Engineering Limited. The revised issue price of Rs. 305.50 per share will impact the cost basis for allottees and may influence market perception of the company's valuation.

**Shareholder Impact**: The modification primarily affects the 149,995 equity shares issued under preferential allotment. Existing shareholders and the preferential allottees need to note the revised price for regulatory compliance, taxation, and accounting purposes.

**Operational Impact**: Limited to Jash Engineering Limited and its preferential allottees. The lock-in provisions remain effective with differential expiry dates for different tranches of shares, which will impact tradability and liquidity of these specific shares until the respective lock-in periods expire.
