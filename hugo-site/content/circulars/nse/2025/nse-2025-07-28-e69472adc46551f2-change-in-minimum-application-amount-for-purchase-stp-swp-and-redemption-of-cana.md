  of Canara Large Cap Fund on NSE MF Invest Platform
---

## Summary

Canara Robeco Mutual Fund has announced a substantial reduction in minimum application amounts for its Large Cap Fund (formerly Blue Chip Equity Fund). The minimum lumpsum investment amount has been reduced from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 100, and similar reductions apply to additional purchases, STP, SWP, and redemption amounts. These changes take effect from July 28, 2025.

## Key Points

- Minimum lumpsum investment reduced from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 100
- Additional purchase minimum reduced from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100

- Minimum redemption amount reduced from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100
- Changes apply to Canara Robeco Large Cap Fund (formerly Canara Robeco Blue Chip Equity Fund)

## Regulatory Changes

This is a fund-specific operational change rather than a regulatory mandate. The amendment updates the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) of the fund to reflect the new minimum investment thresholds.

## Compliance Requirements

- Fund house to update all marketing materials and documentation
- Distribution platforms to update system parameters
- Investors can now invest with significantly lower minimum amounts
- All multiples remain at Re. 1 after the minimum amount

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 28, 2025
- Changes apply to all new investments, additional purchases, and systematic plans initiated on or after the effective date

## Impact Assessment

This change significantly improves accessibility for retail investors by reducing the entry barrier by 98%. The move democratizes access to large-cap equity investments through mutual funds, potentially increasing the investor base. For existing investors, it provides more flexibility for additional investments and systematic plans with lower commitment amounts.
