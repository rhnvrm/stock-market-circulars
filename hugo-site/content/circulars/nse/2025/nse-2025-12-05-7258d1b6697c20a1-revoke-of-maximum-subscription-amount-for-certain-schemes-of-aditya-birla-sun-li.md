  Schemes

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has announced the removal of the maximum subscription limit of Rs. 10 crores per PAN per investor for Aditya Birla Sun Life Medium Term Plan and Aditya Birla Sun Life Credit Risk Fund. This change will be effective from December 8, 2025, on the NSE MF Invest Platform, allowing investors to invest amounts exceeding the previous cap.

## Key Points

- Maximum subscription limit of Rs. 10 crores per PAN removed for two specific schemes
- Applies to Aditya Birla Sun Life Medium Term Plan and Aditya Birla Sun Life Credit Risk Fund
- Change effective from December 8, 2025
- Restriction removal applies across all transactions on NSE MF Invest Platform
- All other features and terms of the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

The investment manager, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited, has issued Addendum No. 53/2025 to remove the restriction on maximum subscription amounts. Previously, investors were limited to Rs. 10 crores per PAN across all transactions in these schemes. This restriction has now been completely removed, enabling unlimited investment amounts subject to other applicable regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must be aware of the revised subscription limits for the affected schemes
- The Notice-cum-Addendum forms an integral part of the SID and KIM for the mentioned schemes
- All members should communicate this change to their clients investing through NSE MF Invest Platform
- Standard mutual fund investment disclosures and risk warnings continue to apply

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: December 5, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 8, 2025 (Monday)
- **Addendum Date**: December 4, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This change primarily benefits high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors who wish to deploy larger amounts in these debt-oriented schemes. The removal of the cap may lead to increased Assets Under Management (AUM) for the affected schemes. For retail investors, this change has minimal impact as most investments fall well below the previous Rs. 10 crore threshold. The move suggests the fund house is comfortable with liquidity management in these schemes and may indicate stable market conditions for the underlying credit and medium-term debt instruments.
