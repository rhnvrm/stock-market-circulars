## Important Dates

- **December 29, 2025**: Circular issued
- **December 30, 2025**: ST-ASM Stage I inclusion effective date; exclusions from ASM framework effective
- **December 31, 2025**: Enhanced margin requirements applicable on new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The inclusion of 8 securities in ST-ASM Stage I will significantly impact trading in these stocks. The minimum 50% margin requirement will increase capital costs for traders and may reduce trading volumes and liquidity in these securities.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members will need to adjust margin collection systems and communicate the changes to clients holding positions in affected securities. Additional margin calls may be triggered for existing positions.

**Positive Development**: The exclusion of 4 securities (AMNPLST, ESFL, MEESHO, SAIFL) from the ASM framework indicates improved market behavior in these stocks, potentially leading to increased liquidity and reduced trading costs.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding positions in the 8 affected securities will face higher margin requirements, potentially requiring additional capital infusion or position reduction. The surveillance measure aims to protect market integrity but may temporarily impact stock prices due to forced selling or reduced buying interest.
