**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in free float for listed companies. Exception is Manaksia Coated Metals with 4.97 million shares, but these remain locked-in until April 2026.

**Trading Impact**: No change to trading mechanisms, lot sizes remain at 1 share for all securities. Securities will be identified by existing codes with updated distinctive number ranges.
