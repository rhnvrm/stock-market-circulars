## Summary

This circular is a corrigendum to NSE Circular No. NSE/CML/71842 dated December 16, 2025. DCM Shriram Industries Limited (DCMSRIND) has revised its record date to December 26, 2025. Consequently, the stock will be available for trading in the Trade for Trade segment (Series: BE) from December 26, 2025 (Friday) and will participate in the call auction during the pre-open session.

## Key Points

- Revised record date for DCMSRIND is now December 26, 2025
- Trading in Trade for Trade segment (Series: BE) will commence on December 26, 2025 (Friday)
- The stock will be part of call auction in pre-open session
- This supersedes the earlier circular NSE/CML/71842 dated December 16, 2025
- Call auction follows SEBI Circular No. CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. The circular implements existing SEBI guidelines on call auction in pre-open session (SEBI Circular No. CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012) for DCMSRIND trading in Trade for Trade segment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure DCMSRIND trades only in Trade for Trade segment (Series: BE) from December 26, 2025
- Members must follow call auction procedures during pre-open session for this security
- Settlement will be on a trade-for-trade basis with no netting of positions

## Important Dates

- **December 18, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **December 26, 2025**: Revised record date for DCM Shriram Industries Limited
- **December 26, 2025 (Friday)**: Commencement of trading in Trade for Trade segment (Series: BE)

## Impact Assessment

The revision of the record date impacts shareholders and traders of DCMSRIND. Trading in the Trade for Trade segment with mandatory delivery settlement restricts speculative trading and requires full upfront margin. The call auction mechanism in pre-open session helps in transparent price discovery. Investors planning corporate actions related to the record date (likely demerger-related as per the original circular reference) should note the updated December 26, 2025 date for determining eligible shareholders.
