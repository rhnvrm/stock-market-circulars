title: Further Extension of Timeline for Mandatory Implementation of Systems and Processes
  by Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs) with respect to T+0 Settlement Cycle
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued a further extension of the timeline for Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs) to implement mandatory systems and processes for the optional T+0 settlement cycle. The original deadline of May 01, 2025 was previously extended to November 01, 2025, and has now been extended again with the new deadline to be communicated at a later date. This extension is based on challenges highlighted by QSBs in ensuring timely readiness of systems.

## Key Points

- Timeline for QSBs to implement T+0 settlement systems extended beyond November 01, 2025
- Further guidance regarding the new timeline will be intimated at a later date
- Extension granted due to challenges in ensuring timely readiness of systems
- Applies to stock brokers designated as QSBs who meet minimum active client parameters as of December 31, 2024
- All other provisions of SEBI Circular dated December 10, 2024 remain unchanged
- This is the second extension granted (first extension moved deadline from May 01, 2025 to November 01, 2025)

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-3/P/CIR/2024/172 dated December 10, 2024 originally mandated that QSBs put in place necessary systems and processes for enabling seamless participation of investors in optional T+0 settlement cycle by May 01, 2025.

SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-3/P/CIR/2025/58 dated April 29, 2025 extended this deadline to November 01, 2025.

The current circular (I/72/2025 dated October 30, 2025) provides a further extension beyond November 01, 2025, with the specific new deadline to be communicated later.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Delays the broader rollout of T+0 settlement cycle in equity cash markets
- Provides relief to QSBs facing technical implementation challenges
- May impact investor expectations for faster settlement capabilities
- Demonstrates regulatory flexibility in response to market feedback

**Operational Impact:**
- QSBs get additional time to develop and test systems for T+0 settlement
- Reduces pressure on brokers to rush implementation, potentially improving quality
- Market Infrastructure Institutions need to adjust their readiness timelines
- May require coordination across multiple stakeholders (exchanges, clearing corporations, depositories)

**Compliance Impact:**
- QSBs must continue working toward implementation but have extended timeline
- Uncertainty around exact new deadline may complicate project planning
- All other provisions of the December 2024 circular remain in effect
