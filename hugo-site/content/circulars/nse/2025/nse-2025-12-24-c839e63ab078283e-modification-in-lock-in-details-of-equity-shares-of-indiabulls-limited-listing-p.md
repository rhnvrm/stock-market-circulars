## Regulatory Changes

This circular modifies the lock-in details from the previous circular (NSE/CML/71992) dated December 24, 2025. All other terms and conditions of the original listing circular remain unchanged. The modification provides specific lock-in details for a subset of the total allotted shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must note the revised lock-in details for Indiabulls Limited equity shares
- The locked-in securities (distinctive numbers 816569214 to 948869213) cannot be traded until the lock-in expiry date
- Securities have been credited in dematerialized mode under temporary ISIN in accordance with SEBI circulars CIR/MRD/DP/21/2012 dated August 2, 2012 and CIR/MRD/DP/24/2012 dated September 11, 2012

## Important Dates

- **Circular date**: December 24, 2025
- **Date of allotment**: November 4, 2025
- **Lock-in expiry date**: April 15, 2027
- **Previous circular reference**: NSE/CML/71992 dated December 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The lock-in affects approximately 5.95% of total allotted shares (132.3 million out of 2,223.9 million shares), restricting their tradability until April 2027. This reduces the floating stock available for trading in the near term.

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium - Trading members and investors holding the specific distinctive number range (816569214 to 948869213) need to be aware that these shares cannot be sold until the lock-in period expires. The majority of allotted shares (approximately 2,091.6 million) remain unaffected by this lock-in restriction.

**Compliance Impact**: Low - This is an informational circular requiring no action beyond updating internal records regarding lock-in restrictions for the specified share block.
