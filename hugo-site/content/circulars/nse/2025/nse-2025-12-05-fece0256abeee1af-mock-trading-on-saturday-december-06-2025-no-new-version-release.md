## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine mock trading session conducted on a non-trading day (Saturday) with no impact on live markets.

**Operational Impact**: Low to moderate for trading members. Members need to allocate resources to participate in the mock session and test their systems, particularly algorithmic trading functionalities. The primary operational focus is on:
- Testing system connectivity and trading functionality
- Validating disaster recovery switchover procedures
- Ensuring compliance with SEBI's algorithmic trading safeguards for retail investors
- Documenting participation evidence for regulatory compliance

**Member Impact**: Trading members in the Currency Derivatives segment must dedicate staff and systems on Saturday for testing purposes. Members who offer algorithmic trading services to retail clients must specifically test those functionalities to meet the SEBI glide path requirements.

**Technology Impact**: No new version deployment reduces technical risk. Members continue using familiar NEAT version 3.5.4, focusing testing efforts on business process compliance rather than system upgrades.
