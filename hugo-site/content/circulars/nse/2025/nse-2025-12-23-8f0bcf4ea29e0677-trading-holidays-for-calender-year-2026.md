## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The holiday schedule affects trading availability for the Debt Segment throughout 2026. Market participants need to plan liquidity management and settlement schedules around these holidays.

**Operational Impact:** Market participants, clearing members, and custodians must adjust their operational calendars, settlement cycles, and resource planning to account for these non-trading days. The clustering of holidays in certain months (March, April, October, November) requires special attention for settlement management.

**Planning Considerations:** Early notification (one year in advance) allows adequate time for operational planning. The special Muhurat Trading session on November 8, 2026 requires separate preparation once timings are announced.
