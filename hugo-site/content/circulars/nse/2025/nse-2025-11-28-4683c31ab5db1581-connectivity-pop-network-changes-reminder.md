title: Connectivity - POP Network Changes - Reminder for Migration Deadlines
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a reminder to all trading members regarding the mandatory migration from existing Point of Presence (POP) locations to new POPs. This circular reiterates the migration timelines previously communicated in August and November 2025. Members with connectivity under the "Self-Service" model from the specified existing POPs must complete migration by the discontinuation dates to maintain uninterrupted trading connectivity.

## Key Points

- Migration is mandatory for members connected through STT Kolkatta, JIVAN VIHAR, and MUMBAI-KURLA POPs
- STT Kolkatta will migrate to SIFY KOL with discontinuation date of December 09, 2025
- JIVAN VIHAR will migrate to SIFY OKHLA with discontinuation date of December 09, 2025
- MUMBAI-KURLA will migrate to SIFY PARLE with discontinuation date of February 07, 2026
- SIFY Technologies Limited is the appointed Telecom Network Integrator (TNI)
- Members with "Self-Service" model links must ensure timely migration
- Connectivity from existing POPs will be permanently discontinued on specified dates
- Members should contact TNI using details in Annexure 1 - Sify Handbook for queries

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular is a reminder of previously announced infrastructure migration requirements from circulars NSE/MSD/69495 dated August 05, 2025 and NSE/MSD/71183 dated November 07, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must migrate their connectivity from existing POPs to new designated POPs
- Members must adhere to the specified migration timelines based on their current POP location
- Members should coordinate with SIFY Technologies Limited (TNI) to complete migration
- Members are responsible for procuring and maintaining their network architecture, assets, and connectivity
- Members must ensure migration is completed before the respective POP discontinuation dates to avoid loss of trading connectivity

## Important Dates

- **December 09, 2025**: Discontinuation date for STT Kolkatta POP (120 days from August 11, 2025)
- **December 09, 2025**: Discontinuation date for JIVAN VIHAR POP (120 days from August 11, 2025)
- **February 07, 2026**: Discontinuation date for MUMBAI-KURLA POP (180 days from August 11, 2025)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: High - Members who fail to migrate by the discontinuation dates will lose connectivity to the Exchange trading system, effectively preventing them from conducting trading operations. This is a critical infrastructure change requiring proactive coordination.

**Member Actions Required**: Trading members connected through the affected POPs must immediately coordinate with SIFY Technologies to schedule and complete their migration. The tight timeline (December 09, 2025 for two POPs) requires urgent action.

**Risk Mitigation**: NSE has disclaimed liability for connectivity services provided by the TNI and last mile telecom service providers. Members are solely responsible for ensuring their connectivity and should create appropriate back-ups. The Exchange emphasizes it is only a facilitator, not a telecom service provider.

**Contact Information**: Members experiencing issues should contact Member Service Department at msm@nse.co.in or toll-free number 1800-266-0050, or contact TNI directly using Annexure 1 details.
