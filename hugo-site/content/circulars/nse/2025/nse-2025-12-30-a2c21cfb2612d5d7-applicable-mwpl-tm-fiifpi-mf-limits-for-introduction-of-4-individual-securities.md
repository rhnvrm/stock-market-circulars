## Regulatory Changes

This circular introduces position limits for four new individual securities in the F&O segment, partially modifying the previous circular dated September 22, 2025. The limits follow NSE's standard framework with hierarchical position limits:

- Market-wide position limits (MWPL) serve as the base

- Combined TM/FPI Category I/MF limits at approximately 30% of MWPL
- FPI Category II limits differentiated based on entity classification

## Compliance Requirements

- All trading members must adhere to the specified position limits for the four securities
- Client positions cannot exceed the overall stock limit for clients
- Proprietary trading desks must comply with proprietary position limits
- FII/FPI entities must monitor positions based on their category classification (Category I, Category II - others, Category II - individuals/family offices/corporates)
- Mutual funds must ensure positions remain within specified limits
- Combined trading member positions (client + proprietary) cannot exceed the overall TM limit

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: December 30, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 31, 2025 (trade date)
- **Reference Circular**: 043/2025 dated April 29, 2025
- **Modified Circular**: 125/2025 dated September 22, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The introduction of F&O contracts for these four securities expands derivative trading opportunities, particularly notable for SWIGGY with its substantial position limit of over 375 million shares. This allows greater hedging and speculation opportunities for market participants.

**Institutional Impact**: FII/FPI and mutual fund investors gain new instruments for portfolio management and hedging. The tiered limits for different FPI categories ensure balanced participation while preventing concentration risk.

**Trading Member Impact**: Trading members can offer derivative products on these securities to clients while managing proprietary positions within specified limits. The 30% combined limit for TM positions provides adequate flexibility for market-making activities.

**Risk Management**: The structured limit framework helps maintain market stability by preventing excessive concentration in any single security while allowing sufficient liquidity for efficient price discovery.
