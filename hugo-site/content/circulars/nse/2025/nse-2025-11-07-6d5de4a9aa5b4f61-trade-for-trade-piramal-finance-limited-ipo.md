This circular follows the previous exchange circular dated November 04, 2025, and is issued pursuant to SEBI guidelines (CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012).

## Regulatory Changes

The securities will transition from:
- **Current Status**: Trade for Trade segment (Series: BE) - a restrictive trading mechanism
- **New Status**: Rolling segment (Series: EQ) - standard trading mechanism

This change is in compliance with SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012, which governs the framework for moving securities from trade for trade to rolling settlement.

## Impact Assessment

This transition represents a positive development for Piramal Finance Limited as it moves from the restrictive trade for trade segment to the regular rolling settlement segment. The change will:

- Enable normal T+1 rolling settlement for PIRAMALFIN securities
- Improve liquidity as securities can be traded with standard settlement mechanisms
- Remove trade for trade restrictions that require immediate delivery
- Allow for intraday trading and standard margin benefits
- Signal completion of initial post-IPO stabilization period

The impact is medium as this affects all market participants trading in Piramal Finance Limited securities, but represents a routine post-IPO progression rather than a significant market event.
