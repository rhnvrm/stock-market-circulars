title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - October 30, 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has issued updates to the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework effective October 30, 2025. One security (Electro Force India Limited) has been moved from Short-Term ASM to Long-Term ASM Stage-I. Two securities (Cartrade Tech Limited and Drone Destination Limited) are being escalated from Stage-I to Stage-II within the Long-Term ASM framework. No securities are being excluded from the ASM framework or moving to Stage-IV at this time.

## Key Points

- Electro Force (India) Limited (EFORCE) moved from STASM to LTASM Stage-I effective October 30, 2025
- Cartrade Tech Limited (CARTRADE) escalated from LTASM Stage-I to Stage-II
- Drone Destination Limited (DRONE) escalated from LTASM Stage-I to Stage-II
- No securities moved to Stage-IV (Trade for Trade basis)
- No securities excluded from ASM framework this period
- No downward stage movements (Stage-IV to Stage-III, Stage-III to Stage-II, or Stage-II to Stage-I)
- Consolidated ASM list includes multiple securities across different stages

## Regulatory Changes

The ASM framework continues to operate under existing guidelines with securities being monitored and moved between stages based on surveillance criteria. Stage-IV securities would be shifted from Rolling Settlement (Series: EQ) to Trade for Trade (Series: BE) on a T+3 basis, though no securities are moving to Stage-IV in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the stage changes for affected securities
- Enhanced margin requirements apply based on ASM stage classification
- Investors trading in ASM securities face increased surveillance margins
- Trade for Trade settlement applies to Stage-IV securities (none in this update)
- Members must ensure compliance with ASM framework requirements for client trading

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 30, 2025 - All stage changes become applicable
- **Circular Issue Date**: October 29, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Three securities experience increased surveillance measures, with EFORCE now under long-term monitoring and CARTRADE and DRONE facing stricter Stage-II requirements including higher margins.

**Trading Impact**: Investors in these three securities will face higher margin requirements and increased surveillance. Stage-II classification typically involves 100% margin requirement compared to lower stages.

**Investor Impact**: Existing positions in EFORCE, CARTRADE, and DRONE will require additional margin funding. New investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance indicating higher risk profiles for these securities.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members must update their surveillance systems and margin calculations for the affected securities by October 30, 2025.
