title: Revision in Scheme of Strikes in Long dated Index Options - NIFTY
---

## Summary

NSE has announced a revision in the strike scheme for NIFTY 50 Long Term Index Options following a semi-annual review. The strike interval will be increased from 1000 to 1500, while maintaining the same strike distribution of 5 in-the-money, 1 at-the-money, and 5 out-of-the-money strikes. This change is part of the periodic review mechanism for discontinuing illiquid strikes.

## Key Points

- Strike interval for NIFTY 50 Long Term Index Options increased from 1000 to 1500
- Number of strikes remains unchanged at 5-1-5 (ITM-ATM-OTM)
- Change based on semi-annual review of illiquid strikes
- References original circular NSE/FAOP/67775 dated April 30, 2025
- Members must load updated contract files before trading on effective date

## Regulatory Changes

**Current Scheme:**
- Strike Interval: 1000
- Strike Distribution: 5 ITM - 1 ATM - 5 OTM

**Revised Scheme (Effective December 31, 2025):**
- Strike Interval: 1500
- Strike Distribution: 5 ITM - 1 ATM - 5 OTM

This revision aligns with the periodic review mechanism established in Chapter 1.10 Strike scheme for modification and discontinuation of illiquid strikes in NIFTY 50 Long Term Index Options.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Load updated contract.gz file in trading application before December 31, 2025
- Load NSE_FO_contract_ddmmyyyy.csv.gz file before trading on effective date
- Access files from faoftp/faocommon directory on Extranet server
- Alternatively, access MII contract file from NSE website: https://www.nseindia.com/all-reports-derivatives

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** December 16, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 31, 2025
- **Action Required By:** December 30, 2025 (members must update systems before trading begins on effective date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
The wider strike interval (1500 vs 1000) will result in fewer total strike prices available for NIFTY long-term options, potentially concentrating liquidity in the available strikes. While the number of ITM, ATM, and OTM strikes remains constant at 5-1-5, the gaps between strikes will be 50% larger.

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members must update contract files in their systems
- Existing positions in strikes outside the new scheme may require monitoring
- Reduced number of available strikes may affect hedging and arbitrage strategies
- Focus on discontinuing illiquid strikes should improve overall market quality

**Trader Impact:**
Option traders using NIFTY long-term options will have fewer strike prices to choose from, but the strikes that remain should have better liquidity based on the semi-annual review process.
