## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to Nectar Lifesciences shareholders participating in the buyback. No broader market disruption expected.

**Operational Impact**: Moderate - requires coordination between members, custodians, depositories, and RTA. The 7-day trading window provides adequate time for eligible shareholders to tender shares. The early pay-in mechanism ensures settlement efficiency.

**Shareholder Impact**: Eligible shareholders have clear timeline to participate in the buyback offer. The comprehensive list of 26 rejection codes (Annexure I) provides transparency on potential reasons for order rejection including technical issues (signature mismatch, PAN mismatch), eligibility issues (shares not eligible as on record date, excess shares tendered), and procedural issues (duplicate bids, bidding above exit price).

**Risk Factors**: Settlement schedule is contingent on timely receipt of acceptance details from RTA and funds from buying members. Any delays could trigger revised settlement schedule, affecting participants' cash flow planning.
