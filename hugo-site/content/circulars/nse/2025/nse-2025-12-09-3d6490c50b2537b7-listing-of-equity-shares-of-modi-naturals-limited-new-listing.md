## Impact Assessment

This new listing expands investment opportunities on NSE by adding Modi Naturals Limited to the tradable universe. The company's shares will be available for trading with standard rolling settlement procedures. Lock-in restrictions on approximately 649,000 shares (4.9% of total) will limit immediate liquidity for those holdings until February 2027, while the majority of shares are freely tradable. Investors can trade in single-share lots, providing flexibility for retail participation. The compulsory demat requirement ensures transparent and efficient settlement.
