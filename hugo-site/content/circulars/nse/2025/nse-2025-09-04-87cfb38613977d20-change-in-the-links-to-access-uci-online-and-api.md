title: Change in the links to access UCI Online and API
---

## Summary

NSE has announced new links for accessing UCI (Unique Client Code) Online services and APIs. Members must transition to the new URLs as existing links will be discontinued effective January 3, 2026.

## Key Points

- New links provided for both Live and UAT environments
- Existing links will cease to function from January 3, 2026
- Changes affect Member Portal access and API endpoints
- Files from UCI Team will remain available at existing Extranet location
- Multiple new domain endpoints introduced (api.nseindia.com, enit.nseindia.com, etc.)

## Regulatory Changes

Migration from connect2nsccl.com domain to nseindia.com domain for UCI services, representing a consolidation of NSE's digital infrastructure.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must update their systems to use new URLs before January 3, 2026
- Update API integrations to point to new endpoints
- Modify Member Portal bookmarks and access procedures
- Test connections in UAT environment before live implementation

## Important Dates

- **September 4, 2025**: Circular issued with new links
- **January 3, 2026**: Existing links will be discontinued

## Impact Assessment

Medium operational impact requiring members to update their technical integrations and access procedures. The four-month transition period provides adequate time for implementation, but failure to migrate could disrupt UCI services access.
