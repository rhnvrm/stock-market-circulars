**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is an administrative update that provides clarity on which Sovereign Gold Bonds are approved as collateral. The 10% haircut is standard and consistent across all SGBs.

**Operational Impact:** Low. Market participants and clearing members need to update their approved securities list but no operational process changes are required.

**Liquidity Impact:** Neutral. The inclusion of 42 SGBs provides adequate options for collateral management, supporting liquidity in the debt market segment without introducing new restrictions or requirements.
