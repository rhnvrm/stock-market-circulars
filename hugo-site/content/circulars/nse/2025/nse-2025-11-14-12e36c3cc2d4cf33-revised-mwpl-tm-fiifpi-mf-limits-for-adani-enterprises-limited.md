## Summary

## Regulatory Changes

The changes differentiate between FPI Category II participants based on their classification (institutional versus individuals/family offices/corporates), with different position limits assigned to each subcategory.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: November 14, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 17, 2025 (trade date)

## Impact Assessment

This circular has a targeted impact on participants trading ADANI ENTERPRISES derivatives. The revised limits may affect position management strategies for trading members, foreign institutional investors, and mutual funds. The differentiated limits for FPI Category II participants (with individuals/family offices/corporates receiving approximately half the limit of other Category II participants) creates a tiered framework that may influence participation patterns. Market participants holding positions approaching these limits will need to adjust their strategies before the November 17 effective date to ensure compliance.
