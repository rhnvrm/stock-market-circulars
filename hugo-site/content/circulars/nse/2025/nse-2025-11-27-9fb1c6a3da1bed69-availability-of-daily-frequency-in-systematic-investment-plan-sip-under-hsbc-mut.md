## Summary

National Stock Exchange of India Limited has informed members that HSBC Mutual Fund will introduce daily frequency option for Systematic Investment Plans (SIP) on the NSE MF Invest Platform effective from November 28, 2025. This new frequency will be available for equity, hybrid, debt and fund of funds schemes with specific minimum investment requirements.

## Key Points

- Daily SIP frequency introduced for HSBC Mutual Fund schemes on NSE MF Invest Platform
- Effective date: November 28, 2025
- Minimum installment amount: Rs. 500/- for equity, hybrid, debt and FoF schemes (in multiples of Re. 1/-)
- Minimum requirement: 6 installments subject to aggregate of Rs. 6,000/-
- Daily SIP will be processed Monday to Friday on all business days
- Not applicable for HSBC ELSS Tax Saver Fund and HSBC Tax Saver Equity Fund
- SIP Pause, SIP Top Up and Multi Scheme SIP options will not be available under daily SIP frequency
- Non-business days falling between Monday to Friday will not be processed on the next business day

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational enhancement to existing mutual fund investment facilities, adding daily frequency as an additional option alongside existing SIP frequencies.

## Compliance Requirements

No compliance requirements for exchange members or listed companies. This is an informational circular about mutual fund platform feature enhancement.

## Important Dates

- **November 27, 2025**: Circular issued by NSE
- **November 28, 2025**: Daily SIP frequency becomes available on NSE MF Invest Platform for HSBC Mutual Fund schemes

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a product feature enhancement for mutual fund investors.

**Operational Impact**: Provides additional flexibility for investors who prefer daily SIP contributions instead of weekly, monthly or quarterly frequencies. The Rs. 500/- minimum installment and 6 installment minimum (Rs. 6,000/- aggregate) makes daily SIPs accessible to retail investors.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for HSBC Mutual Fund investors seeking more frequent investment discipline. Daily SIP processing on business days (Monday-Friday) allows for systematic daily investment habits. Note that ELSS tax saver schemes remain excluded as HSBC Tax Saver Equity Fund is closed for new subscriptions since November 25, 2022.
