## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) as per the framework established in previous circulars (NSE/SURV/39265, NSE/SURV/45111, NSE/SURV/46557, NSE/SURV/48506, NSE/SURV/52090, NSE/SURV/63362, and NSE/SURV/64066). The measure imposes enhanced margin requirements on securities that meet specific surveillance criteria.

## Important Dates

- **November 20, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 21, 2025**: TGL included in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage I
- **November 24, 2025**: Last day before margin requirement takes effect
- **November 25, 2025**: 100% margin requirement becomes applicable on TGL

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The 100% margin requirement on Teerth Gopicon Limited will significantly impact liquidity and trading activity in the stock. Traders will need to provide full upfront margin, eliminating leverage possibilities and likely reducing speculative trading volumes.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their risk management systems to enforce the 100% margin requirement. Existing positions will need additional margin funding, potentially forcing some traders to close positions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding TGL will face higher capital requirements for maintaining or initiating positions. This measure aims to curb excessive speculation and volatility in the security. The exchange has clarified this is a surveillance measure and not a reflection on the company's fundamentals.
