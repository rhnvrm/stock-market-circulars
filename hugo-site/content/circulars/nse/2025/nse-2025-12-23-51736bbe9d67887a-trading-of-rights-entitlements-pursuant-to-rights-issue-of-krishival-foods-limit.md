## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The circular facilitates a short 6-day trading window for renunciation of rights entitlements, allowing existing shareholders who do not wish to subscribe to the rights issue to monetize their entitlements by selling them in the secondary market.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to ensure proper client communication and include mandatory disclaimers in contract notes. The Trade to Trade settlement and compulsory demat requirement ensures transparent and settled transactions.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders of Krishival Foods Limited can either subscribe to the rights issue, renounce (sell) their REs during the trading period, or let them lapse. The narrow trading window of 6 days requires prompt decision-making.
