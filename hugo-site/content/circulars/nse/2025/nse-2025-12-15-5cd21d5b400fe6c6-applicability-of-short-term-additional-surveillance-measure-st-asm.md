## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Traders with positions in the three affected securities will face significantly higher margin requirements
- Potential reduction in trading volumes and liquidity for these securities
- Increased capital requirements may force position unwinding or limit new position creation

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers must ensure margin collection systems are updated for the affected securities
- Risk management systems need to reflect the new margin requirements
- Traders need to arrange additional funds or reduce positions to meet margin calls

**Stock-Specific Impact:**
- High impact on CEDAAR, S&SPOWER, and SMCGLOBAL due to 50% minimum margin requirement
- Positive development for TOTAL as it exits ASM framework, returning to normal margin requirements
