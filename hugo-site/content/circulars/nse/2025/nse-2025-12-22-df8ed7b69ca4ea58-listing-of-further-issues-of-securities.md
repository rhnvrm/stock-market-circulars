## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a routine administrative notification for ESOP-allotted shares. The quantities being listed are relatively small compared to the outstanding share capital of these companies, particularly for large-cap entities like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.

**Operational Impact:** Negligible operational changes required. Trading members will continue normal operations with updated security codes and distinctive number ranges for record-keeping purposes.

**Investor Impact:** Neutral. ESOP allotments are standard corporate actions that result in minor dilution but are typically anticipated by the market and already factored into valuations.
