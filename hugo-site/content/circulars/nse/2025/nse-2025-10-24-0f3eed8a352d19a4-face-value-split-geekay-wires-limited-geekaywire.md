This corporate action will proportionally increase the number of outstanding shares while maintaining the same market capitalization.

## Compliance Requirements

- All members and market participants must note the change in face value effective October 30, 2025
- Trading systems will reflect the new face value and adjusted share count from the effective date
- Existing shareholders will automatically receive proportionately increased number of shares
- No action required from shareholders as the adjustment is automatic

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** October 24, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 30, 2025 - Face value split becomes effective

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium. Face value splits typically improve liquidity by reducing the per-share price, making the stock more accessible to retail investors. The split does not change the company's market capitalization or fundamental value.

**Shareholder Impact:** Neutral to positive. Existing shareholders will hold twice the number of shares at half the face value, maintaining their proportionate ownership and total investment value. Enhanced liquidity may improve trading volumes.

**Trading Impact:** The lower price per share post-split may attract more retail participation and improve price discovery through increased trading activity.
