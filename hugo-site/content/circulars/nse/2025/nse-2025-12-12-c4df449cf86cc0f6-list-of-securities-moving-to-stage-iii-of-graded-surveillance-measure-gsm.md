## Regulatory Changes

Gujarat Lease Financing Limited has been escalated to Stage III of the GSM framework, which is the second-highest surveillance stage. The GSM framework has four stages with progressively stricter measures:

**Stage III Measures (Current):**
- Trade for Trade settlement
- 5% or lower price band
- Weekly trading only (Mondays/first trading day)
- 100% ASD from buyers

**Stage IV Measures (Next Level):**
- Same as Stage III but with no upward price movement allowed

The framework is designed to protect investors and ensure orderly trading in securities exhibiting unusual market behavior or volatility.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Take adequate precautions while trading in GLFL
- Ensure buyers deposit 100% ASD of trade value
- Execute trades only on designated trading days (Mondays/first trading day of week)
- Follow trade-for-trade settlement procedures with no netting off
- Adhere to applicable price band restrictions of 5% or lower

**For Investors/Buyers:**
- Deposit 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit on trade value
- Accept trade-for-trade settlement terms
- Trade only during permitted weekly window

**Queries:**
- Members can contact NSE at surveillance@nse.co.in for clarifications

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** December 12, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 15, 2025
- **Trading Days:** Every Monday or first trading day of the week (ongoing)

## Impact Assessment

**Liquidity Impact:** Severe reduction in trading liquidity due to weekly-only trading window and trade-for-trade settlement without netting.

**Cost Impact:** 100% ASD requirement significantly increases capital requirements for buyers, deterring speculative trading.

**Price Discovery:** Limited to 5% price band and weekly trading, restricting normal price discovery mechanisms.

**Investor Protection:** Enhanced surveillance measures protect investors from potential volatility and irregular market activity in this security.

**Market Operations:** Settlement operations simplified due to trade-for-trade basis, but frequency reduced to weekly cycles.

**Exit Difficulty:** Existing holders may face challenges in exiting positions due to restricted trading frequency and buyer deposit requirements.

The Stage III classification indicates NSE has identified concerns warranting heightened surveillance. Investors should exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before trading in this security.
