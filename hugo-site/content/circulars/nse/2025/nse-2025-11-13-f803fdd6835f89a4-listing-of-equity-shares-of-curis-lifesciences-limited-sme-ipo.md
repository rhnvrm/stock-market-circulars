## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to medium. This is an SME listing on the EMERGE platform, affecting primarily SME investors and market makers. The Trade for Trade surveillance segment placement indicates enhanced monitoring.

**Operational Impact:** Market participants trading in SME segment need to note the new listing. Initial T4T settlement requires delivery-based trading only, limiting speculation. Market makers (RS Wealth Management Private Limited) must maintain liquidity within specified spread limits.

**Investor Impact:** SME investors gain access to new pharmaceutical/lifesciences company. Higher lot size (1,000 shares at Rs. 128 = Rs. 1,28,000 minimum investment) creates entry barrier. Lock-in provisions apply to promoter/pre-IPO holdings as per Annexure I.
