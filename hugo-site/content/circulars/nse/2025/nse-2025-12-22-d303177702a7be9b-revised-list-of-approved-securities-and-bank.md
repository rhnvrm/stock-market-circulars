title: Revised List of Approved Securities and Banks for Liquid Assets
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a revised list of approved equity securities that clearing members can deposit as non-cash component of liquid assets for margin requirements. The list comprises 40 blue-chip stocks including major index constituents. Each security is subject to VAR-based haircut and members can deposit each security up to a maximum of 25% of total margins.

## Key Points

- 40 equity securities approved for liquid asset collateral
- VAR (Value at Risk) based haircuts applicable on all securities
- Maximum 25% concentration limit per security of total margins
- Overall permitted quantities specified across all segments
- Memberwise permitted quantity for COM segment listed as N.A. for all securities
- List includes major stocks: RELIANCE, HDFCBANK, ITC, ICICIBANK, INFY, SBIN, TCS, and others
- Covers diverse sectors: Banking, IT, Auto, FMCG, Pharmaceuticals, Energy, Telecom

## Regulatory Changes

This circular updates the approved securities list for collateral purposes. The VAR-based haircut methodology ensures dynamic risk adjustment based on market volatility. The 25% concentration limit per security prevents excessive exposure to single stock risk in the collateral pool.

## Compliance Requirements

- Clearing members must limit deposits of each approved security to maximum 25% of total margin requirements
- Only securities listed in Annexure 1, 2 & 3 are eligible for non-cash liquid asset component
- Members must comply with overall permitted quantity limits specified for each security across all segments
- VAR-based haircuts will be applied to determine collateral value

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects collateral management for clearing members but does not change trading rules or market structure.

**Operational Impact:** Clearing members need to monitor their collateral composition to ensure compliance with the 25% per-security limit and use only approved securities from the updated list.

**Liquidity Impact:** The approved list consists of highly liquid large-cap stocks with substantial permitted quantities, ensuring adequate collateral availability while maintaining risk management standards through VAR haircuts and concentration limits.
