## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The migration from SME to main board represents a significant development milestone for Modis Navnirman Limited, indicating growth and compliance with mainboard listing requirements. This increases the company's visibility and liquidity potential.

**Trading Impact**: The listing on NSE main board may attract institutional investors and increase trading volumes. The low market lot size (1 share) makes the stock accessible to retail investors.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will benefit from enhanced liquidity and broader market access. However, 2.55% of shares (500,000) remain under lock-in until December 15, 2025, which may temporarily limit supply. The compulsory demat requirement ensures secure and efficient trading.

**Regulatory Impact**: The migration demonstrates the company's compliance with more stringent mainboard listing norms, potentially improving corporate governance standards and disclosure requirements.
