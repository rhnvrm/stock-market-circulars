  Rack Conversion
---

## Summary

National Stock Exchange of India Limited has announced that colocation participants holding adjacent full racks in colocation facility phase 13 and onwards can submit requests for removal of side panel sections to convert their racks into High Power Density (HPD) rack variants. This facility will be available from November 17, 2025. The initiative continues from the earlier circular NSE/MSD/68052 dated May 19, 2025, which introduced the HPD rack variant.

## Key Points

- Colo participants can request removal of side panel sections from allotted full racks for HPD rack conversion starting November 17, 2025
- HPD rack variant is available from Colocation phase 13 onwards
- Only participants holding adjacent full racks in phase 13 and onwards are eligible
- Both full racks must be adjacent to each other, sharing the partition wall/side panel
- Only 1 conversion request per application
- Conversion is subject to availability and feasibility of necessary infrastructure at Exchange end
- Requests must be submitted using Annexure A format on company letterhead
- All other terms and conditions from circular NSE/MSD/68052 dated May 19, 2025 remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced. This circular provides an operational enhancement to the existing colocation facility framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Request must include: Trading Member name, TM Code, Rack numbers, Rack type, and Colocation Phase number
- Application must be signed by authorized signatory with company stamp

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: This initiative provides flexibility to colocation participants to optimize their infrastructure by converting existing full racks into High Power Density racks. This allows for better utilization of space and power capacity for members with higher computational requirements.

**Affected Parties**: Only members and CaaS vendors using NSE's colocation facility from phase 13 onwards are affected. The initiative does not impact trading operations, market participants, or listed companies.

**Financial Impact**: Minimal - this is an infrastructure optimization option for existing colocation users.

**Disclaimer**: Exchange provides colocation facility on best effort basis and is not responsible for any direct/indirect/consequential losses including power failure, air conditioning failure, system failure, connectivity loss, or discontinuation due to legal/regulatory requirements.
