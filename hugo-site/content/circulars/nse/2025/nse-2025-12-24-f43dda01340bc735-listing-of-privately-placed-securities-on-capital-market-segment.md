## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to privately placed debt securities that are typically held by institutional investors. The listing provides liquidity options for existing bondholders but does not affect equity markets or retail investors. The addition of these securities expands the debt market offerings on NSE but represents routine administrative listing activity.
