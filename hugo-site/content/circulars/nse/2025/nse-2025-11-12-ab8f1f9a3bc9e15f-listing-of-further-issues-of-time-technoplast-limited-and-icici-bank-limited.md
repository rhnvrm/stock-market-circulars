## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The Time Technoplast QIP represents a significant capital raise with nearly 40 million shares added to the free float, which may impact trading liquidity and price discovery. The issue price of Rs. 201.12 provides a reference point for market valuation. The ICICI Bank listing of 174,622 shares from abeyance is minimal and unlikely to have material market impact given the bank's large outstanding share base.

**Trading Impact**: Both securities will be available for trading from November 13, 2025, with standard market lot of 1 share. No special trading restrictions or lock-in periods apply, allowing immediate liquidity.
