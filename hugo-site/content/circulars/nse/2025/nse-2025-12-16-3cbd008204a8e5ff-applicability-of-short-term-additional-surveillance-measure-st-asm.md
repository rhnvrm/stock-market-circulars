title: Applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

NSE has announced changes to the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective December 17, 2025. Six securities have been added to ST-ASM Stage-I, and four securities are being excluded from the ASM framework entirely. The consolidated ASM list now contains 26 securities across Stage-I and Stage-II, subject to enhanced surveillance and trading restrictions.

## Key Points

- 6 securities added to Short-Term ASM Stage-I: CEWATER, DIGJAMLMTD, MAHAPEXLTD, SATECH, SHAKTIPUMP, TARIL
- 4 securities excluded from ASM framework: CAPTRUST, ELDEHSG, POSITRON, SAFEENTP
- No securities moved between Stage-I and Stage-II
- No new additions to Stage-II
- DIGJAMLMTD satisfies criteria at BSE
- Total 26 securities remain under consolidated ASM framework (24 in Stage-I, 2 in Stage-II)

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities exhibiting abnormal price movements. Securities under ST-ASM are subject to:
- Enhanced surveillance monitoring
- Potential trading restrictions including price bands
- Additional margin requirements
- Reduced trading limits for certain participant categories

Stage-I represents initial surveillance level, while Stage-II indicates heightened concerns requiring stricter measures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ST-ASM framework requirements for affected securities
- Enhanced due diligence required for client orders in ST-ASM securities
- Margin requirements as specified by the exchange must be collected
- Investors should be made aware of securities under surveillance framework
- Price discovery mechanisms subject to applicable ASM stage restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 17, 2025 - Changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The addition of 6 securities to ST-ASM Stage-I will result in increased trading costs through higher margins and potential liquidity constraints. Investors in these securities may face restricted order placement capabilities.

**Liquidity Impact**: Securities entering ST-ASM typically experience reduced trading volumes due to enhanced surveillance measures and stricter position limits.

**Positive Development**: Exclusion of 4 securities (CAPTRUST, ELDEHSG, POSITRON, SAFEENTP) from ASM framework indicates improved price stability and normalizing trading patterns, restoring regular trading conditions.

**Investor Consideration**: The ST-ASM framework serves as a risk indicator. Investors should exercise caution when trading in listed securities and conduct thorough due diligence before taking positions.
