**Market Impact:** The listing provides continuity for existing debenture holders following the corporate restructuring. The securities maintain their original terms and conditions, ensuring no disruption to debt investors.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to update their systems with the new security codes and ISIN numbers. The restructuring reflects the separation of commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles businesses within the Tata Motors Group.

The credit profile and risk assessment may need re-evaluation based on the restructured entity's standalone financials and business operations.
