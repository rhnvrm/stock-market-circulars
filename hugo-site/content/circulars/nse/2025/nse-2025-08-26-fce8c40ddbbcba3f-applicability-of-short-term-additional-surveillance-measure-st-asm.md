## Summary

NSE has implemented Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I on 9 securities effective August 29, 2025. The measure increases margin requirements to 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher, with a maximum cap of 100%. This surveillance action is based on market monitoring criteria and applies to both existing open positions and new positions.

## Key Points

- 9 securities included in ST-ASM Stage I framework
- Margin requirement increased to minimum 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher
- Maximum margin capped at 100%
- Applies to all open positions as on August 28, 2025
- Applies to new positions created from August 29, 2025
- No securities in Stage II or moving between stages
- 3 securities excluded from ASM framework (ARROWGREEN, BAFNAPH, DIGISPICE)

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of enhanced margin requirements under ST-ASM framework for identified securities. The surveillance measure works in conjunction with all other existing surveillance measures imposed by the exchange.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain higher margin requirements for affected securities
- Compliance with 50% minimum margin or existing margin, whichever is higher
- Maximum margin requirement capped at 100%
- All trading members must adhere to enhanced surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **August 28, 2025**: Cut-off date for existing open positions
- **August 29, 2025**: ST-ASM measures become effective

## Impact Assessment

The enhanced margin requirements will increase trading costs for the affected securities, potentially reducing trading volumes and liquidity.
