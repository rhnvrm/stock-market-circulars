## Summary

NSE has announced that NOIDA TOLL BRIDGE COMPANY LIMITED (Symbol: NOIDATOLL) will be moved to Stage I of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective November 11, 2025. This action follows previous circulars and aligns with BSE's decision. The security will be subject to enhanced surveillance parameters including 100% margin requirements and trade-to-trade settlement with no netting off allowed.

## Key Points

- NOIDA TOLL BRIDGE COMPANY LIMITED (ISIN: INE781B01015) to move to Stage I of GSM
- Applicable margin rate: 100%
- Price band: 5% or lower as applicable
- Trade-to-trade settlement basis with no netting off
- Action added as per BSE precedent
- Members advised to take adequate precautions while trading

## Regulatory Changes

The security will transition from regular trading to Stage I of the Graded Surveillance Measure framework. Under Stage I:

- **Margin Requirements**: 100% applicable margin rate
- **Price Band**: Limited to 5% or lower as applicable
- **Settlement**: Trade-for-trade basis only
- **Netting**: No netting off allowed for settlements

The GSM framework has four progressive stages with increasing restrictions. Stage I represents the initial level of enhanced surveillance.

## Compliance Requirements

**For NSE Members:**
- Exercise adequate precautions when trading in NOIDATOLL
- Ensure clients are aware of the 100% margin requirement
- Process all trades on a trade-to-trade basis without netting off
- Comply with the 5% price band restriction
- Direct any queries to surveillance@nse.co.in

**For Traders/Investors:**
- Must provide 100% margin upfront for trading
- Cannot net off positions; each trade settles individually
- Subject to restricted price movement (5% band)

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: November 10, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 11, 2025
- **Circular Reference**: NSE/SURV/71203 (Circular No. 869/2025)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The move to Stage I GSM will likely reduce liquidity in NOIDATOLL as the 100% margin requirement and trade-to-trade settlement may deter speculative trading and increase transaction costs.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must adjust their risk management systems to enforce 100% margin collection and disable netting for this security. Back-office systems need to process each trade individually for settlement.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors will face higher capital requirements (100% margin) and reduced flexibility due to trade-to-trade settlement. The 5% price band may limit volatility but also restrict price discovery.

**Surveillance Context**: This is the first stage of a four-stage framework. If concerns persist, the security could progress to Stage II (requiring 50% Additional Surveillance Deposit), Stage III (weekly trading only with 100% ASD), or Stage IV (weekly trading with no upward movement allowed).
