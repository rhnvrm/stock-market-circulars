## Important Dates

- **November 12, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **November 13, 2025**: Effective date for listing and trading
- **Allotment Dates**:
  - Acme Solar: November 6, 2025
  - Delphi World Money: November 10, 2025
  - Navin Fluorine: October 29, 2025
  - Rossari Biotech: October 15, 2025
  - Black Box: September 30, 2025
- **May 25, 2026**: Lock-in expiry for Black Box Limited shares

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - These are routine corporate actions involving further issuances that typically represent small percentages of existing share capital. The largest issuance is Delphi World Money with 5.2 million shares from a rights issue.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal incremental impact on liquidity for most stocks as ESOP allotments are relatively small. Delphi World Money may see moderate liquidity increase from the rights issue.

**Trading Impact**: Securities will be immediately available for trading from November 13, 2025, with no trading restrictions except for Black Box Limited's lock-in period.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders are diluted marginally by these issuances. ESOP allotments indicate employee retention initiatives. Black Box's warrant conversion suggests fulfillment of preferential allotment commitments. Delphi World Money's rights issue shareholders receive their allotted shares.
