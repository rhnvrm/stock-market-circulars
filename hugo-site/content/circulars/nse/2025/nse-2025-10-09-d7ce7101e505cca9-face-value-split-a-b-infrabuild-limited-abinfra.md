## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has announced that A B Infrabuild Limited (ABINFRA) will undergo a face value split of its equity shares. The face value and paid-up value will be reduced from Rs. 10 to Re. 1, representing a 1:10 split ratio. This change will be effective from October 17, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: A B Infrabuild Limited (Symbol: ABINFRA)
- Existing face value and paid-up value: Rs. 10
- New face value and paid-up value: Re. 1
- Split ratio: 1:10 (each existing share will be split into 10 shares)
- Circular Reference: NSE/CML/70725, Circular No. 1982/2025
- Issuing Department: Listing Department

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a company-specific corporate action approved and being implemented through NSE's listing framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members and market participants must update their systems to reflect the new face value from the effective date
- Trading systems should be adjusted to account for the 1:10 split in share quantity and proportionate price adjustment
- Shareholders will automatically receive the split shares; no action required from shareholders

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** October 09, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The face value split will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10 times while proportionally reducing the share price, making the stock more affordable and potentially improving liquidity. The market capitalization and shareholder value remain unchanged.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers, depositories, and market infrastructure providers need to update their systems before October 17, 2025 to reflect the new face value and adjusted share quantities. Post-split, all corporate benefits and voting rights will be proportionately adjusted.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders will see their shareholding quantity increase 10-fold with a corresponding reduction in per-share price. This typically improves stock liquidity and may attract retail investors due to lower price per share.
