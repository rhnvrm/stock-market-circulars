## Summary

The National Stock Exchange has issued a surveillance circular implementing Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I for one security - Sheetal Cool Products Limited (SCPL). The measure requires an applicable margin rate of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at 100%, effective December 15, 2025. Additionally, two securities - De Neers Tools Limited (DENEERS) and Holmarc Opto-Mechatronics Limited (HOLMARC) - are being excluded from the ASM framework.

## Key Points

- One security shortlisted for ST-ASM Stage I: Sheetal Cool Products Limited (SCPL, ISIN: INE501Y01019)
- Margin requirement of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at 100%
- No securities shortlisted for ST-ASM Stage II
- No securities moving between ST-ASM stages
- Two securities excluded from ASM framework: DENEERS and HOLMARC
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the company

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Limited market-wide impact as only one security enters ST-ASM Stage I
- Two securities being excluded from ASM framework may see relaxed trading conditions
- Enhanced margin requirements may reduce speculative activity in SCPL

**Trading Impact:**
- Traders holding positions in SCPL will face increased margin requirements (minimum 50%)
- Higher margins may reduce liquidity and trading volumes in the affected security
- Potential reduction in leveraged positions

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers and members must ensure adequate margin collection for SCPL positions
- Risk management systems need to be updated to reflect new margin requirements
- Position monitoring required for compliance with enhanced surveillance measures

**Positive Developments:**
- Exclusion of DENEERS and HOLMARC from ASM framework indicates improved market conditions for these securities
- Normal trading conditions restored for excluded securities
