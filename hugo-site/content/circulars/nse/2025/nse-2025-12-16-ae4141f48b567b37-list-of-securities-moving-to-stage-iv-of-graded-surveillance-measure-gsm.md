---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange has announced that two securities - GRAND FOUNDRY LIMITED (GFSTEELS) and UNIVA FOODS LIMITED (UNIVAFOODS) - will be moved to Stage IV of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective December 17, 2025. This is the most stringent stage of surveillance with severe trading restrictions including trade-for-trade settlement, weekly trading only (every Monday/first trading day), 5% or lower price band, 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit requirement for buyers, and critically, no upward price movement allowed.

## Key Points

- Two securities moving to Stage IV GSM: GRAND FOUNDRY LIMITED (Symbol: GFSTEELS, ISIN: INE534A01028) and UNIVA FOODS LIMITED (Symbol: UNIVAFOODS, ISIN: INE275F01019)
- Stage IV is the highest and most restrictive surveillance stage in the GSM framework
- Trading permitted only once per week (every Monday or first trading day of the week)
- Trade-for-trade basis with no netting off allowed in settlement
- Price band restricted to 5% or lower as applicable
- 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) of trade value required from buyers
- No upward price movement allowed - prices can only remain stable or move downward
- Members advised to take adequate precaution while trading in these securities

## Regulatory Changes

This circular continues the progressive implementation of the Graded Surveillance Measure framework, originally introduced through circulars dating back to February 23, 2017. The GSM framework consists of four stages with progressively stringent measures:

**Stage I:** 100% margin rate with 5% or lower price band

**Stage II:** Trade-for-trade with 5% or lower price band and 50% ASD from buyers

**Stage III:** Trade-for-trade with 5% or lower price band, weekly trading only, and 100% ASD from buyers

**Stage IV:** Trade-for-trade with 5% or lower price band, weekly trading only, 100% ASD from buyers, and no upward price movement

The two securities are being escalated to Stage IV, indicating continued concerns about their trading patterns or compliance issues.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members:** Must ensure all trades in GFSTEELS and UNIVAFOODS are executed only on Mondays (or the first trading day of the week)
- **Buyers:** Must deposit 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit of the trade value
- **Settlement:** All trades must be settled on a trade-for-trade basis with no netting off permitted
- **Price Restrictions:** Trading systems must enforce the 5% or lower price band with no upward movement allowed
- **Risk Management:** Members must exercise adequate precaution and inform their clients about the severe restrictions and risks associated with these securities
- **Queries:** Any questions should be directed to surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** December 16, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 17, 2025 - Stage IV GSM measures become applicable
- **First Permitted Trading Day:** December 22, 2025 (Monday) or next first trading day of the week

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Severe liquidity constraints due to weekly trading restriction
- Significant reduction in trading volumes expected
- Price discovery mechanism heavily impaired due to no upward movement restriction
- Effectively creates a one-way market (downward or stable only)

**Investor Impact:**
- Existing investors face extremely limited exit opportunities (only once per week)
- High capital requirement for any new buyers (100% ASD in addition to purchase price)
- Potential for significant losses if further price declines occur
- Psychological impact of "no upward movement" restriction may deter any buying interest

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers must implement strict controls to prevent inadvertent trades on non-permitted days
- Settlement teams must ensure trade-for-trade processing with no netting
- Increased surveillance and monitoring requirements for compliance teams
- Client communication and disclosure obligations regarding risks

**Systemic Implications:**
- Stage IV GSM typically precedes potential delisting or suspension considerations
- Indicates serious concerns by the Exchange about these securities
- Serves as a strong deterrent signal to market participants
- May prompt corporate action or regulatory intervention by the companies involved

Investors and traders should exercise extreme caution with these securities given the unprecedented restrictions being imposed.
