## Impact Assessment

This listing provides investment opportunities in the SME logistics sector through the NSE EMERGE platform. The Trade for Trade Surveillance Segment classification indicates enhanced monitoring initially, which is standard for new SME listings. Impact is limited to SME segment participants and investors interested in logistics sector SMEs. The appointment of a market maker ensures liquidity support. Overall market impact is minimal as this affects only the SME segment.
