## Summary

NSE has moved Gujarat Lease Financing Limited (GLFL, ISIN: INE540A01017) to Stage III of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective October 30, 2025. This action imposes stringent trading restrictions including trade-for-trade settlement with no netting off, trading permitted only once a week (every Monday or first trading day), a price band of 5% or lower, and mandatory Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) of 100% of trade value to be deposited by buyers.

## Key Points

- GLFL moved to Stage III of GSM effective October 30, 2025
- Trading restricted to once per week (Mondays/first trading day only)
- Trade-for-trade settlement mandatory with no netting off allowed
- Price band restricted to 5% or lower
- Buyers must deposit 100% ASD (Additional Surveillance Deposit) of trade value
- Members advised to take adequate precautions while trading
- Circular continues previous NSE surveillance circulars from 2017-2025

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements Stage III surveillance actions under the GSM framework for GLFL. The GSM framework has four progressive stages:

- **Stage I**: 100% margin rate and 5% or lower price band
- **Stage II**: Trade-for-trade with 5% price band and 50% ASD from buyers
- **Stage III**: Trade-for-trade with 5% price band, weekly trading only (Mondays), and 100% ASD from buyers
- **Stage IV**: Same as Stage III plus no upward price movement allowed

This action represents an escalation in surveillance measures, indicating heightened concerns about the security.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Execute trades in GLFL only on Mondays or the first trading day of the week
- Ensure trade-for-trade settlement for all transactions
- Do not attempt netting off of positions
- Adhere to 5% or lower price band restrictions

**For Buyers:**
- Deposit 100% ASD (Additional Surveillance Deposit) of trade value upfront
- Ensure funds availability before executing purchases

**For All Members:**
- Exercise adequate precautions when trading in this security
- Direct queries to surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **October 29, 2025**: Circular issued (Ref No: 834/2025)
- **October 30, 2025**: Stage III GSM measures become effective for GLFL
- **Trading Schedule**: Every Monday or first trading day of each week only

## Impact Assessment

**Liquidity Impact**: Severe reduction in liquidity for GLFL as trading is restricted to once per week with no intraday netting, making it extremely difficult for investors to enter or exit positions.

**Cost Impact**: The 100% ASD requirement significantly increases the capital cost for buyers, as they must deposit the full trade value in addition to the purchase price, effectively doubling the immediate cash requirement.

**Price Discovery Impact**: The 5% price band combined with weekly trading severely constrains price discovery mechanisms and may lead to increased volatility on trading days.

**Investor Confidence**: Stage III GSM placement signals serious regulatory concerns about the security, likely deterring institutional and retail investors and further reducing market participation.

**Market Access**: Only committed long-term investors or those with specific strategic reasons will likely participate given the severe restrictions and capital requirements.
