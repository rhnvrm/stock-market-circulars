## Summary

NSE has updated the list of securities under the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) Framework effective October 24, 2025. Four securities have been shortlisted in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I, while one security (Xelpmoc Design And Tech Limited) has been excluded from the ASM Framework as it moved to the ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure) framework.

## Key Points

- 4 securities added to Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- No securities placed in Stage-IV or moved between stages
- 1 security (XELPMOC) excluded from ASM and moved to ESM framework
- Changes effective from October 24, 2025
- Securities in Stage-IV would be shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ) to Trade for Trade (BE) on T+3 basis

## Securities Added to Long-Term ASM Stage-I

| Symbol | Security Name | ISIN |
|--------|---------------|------|
| LATTEYS | Latteys Industries Limited | INE262Z01023 |
| NURECA | Nureca Limited | INE0DSF01015 |
| SAMBHAAV | Sambhaav Media Limited | INE699B01027 |
| SELMC | SEL Manufacturing Company Limited | INE105I01020 |

## Securities Excluded from ASM Framework

| Symbol | Security Name | ISIN | Reason |
|--------|---------------|------|--------|
| XELPMOC | Xelpmoc Design And Tech Limited | INE01P501012 | Moved from LTASM to ESM framework |

## Regulatory Changes

Securities under the Long-Term ASM Framework are subject to enhanced surveillance measures. Stage-I represents the initial level of surveillance, with progressively stricter measures applied in higher stages. Securities in Stage-IV (as per Criteria VII) are shifted from Rolling Settlement (Series: EQ) to Trade for Trade (Series: BE) settlement on a T+3 basis.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the ASM classification for affected securities
- Enhanced surveillance measures apply to all transactions in listed securities
- Stage-I securities remain in rolling settlement but are subject to additional monitoring
- Market participants should review their positions in affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 24, 2025
- All changes to ASM classifications take effect from the start of trading on this date

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 4 securities to ASM Stage-I indicates NSE's identification of potential price volatility or unusual trading patterns in these stocks. Investors and traders should exercise enhanced caution when trading these securities. The movement of XELPMOC from LTASM to ESM framework suggests escalated surveillance concerns requiring a different monitoring approach. These measures aim to protect market integrity and investor interests by identifying and monitoring securities with abnormal price movements or trading volumes.
