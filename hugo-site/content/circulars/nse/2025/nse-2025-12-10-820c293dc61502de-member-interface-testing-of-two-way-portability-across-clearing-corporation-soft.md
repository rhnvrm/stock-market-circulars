## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - This is a routine quarterly compliance exercise with no direct market impact. However, member participation is mandatory to ensure business continuity preparedness.

**Market Impact**: Low - The mock session does not affect regular trading or clearing operations. It is conducted to test backup infrastructure.

**Member Impact**: Medium - Members must allocate resources and technical personnel to participate in testing during the specified time window. Those without login credentials need to obtain them promptly.

**Business Continuity**: High importance for long-term resilience - These quarterly drills ensure that in case of primary system failure, clearing operations can seamlessly transition to the SaaS backup setup, thereby protecting market integrity and reducing systemic risk.

**Contact Support**: Members can reach NCL support at 18002660050 (IVR Option 2) or support@nsccl.co.in for assistance.
