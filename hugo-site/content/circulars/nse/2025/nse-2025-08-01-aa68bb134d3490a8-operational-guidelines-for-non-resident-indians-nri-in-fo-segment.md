## Summary

NSE has discontinued the mandatory requirement for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) to obtain Custodian Participant (CP) codes for trading in the Futures & Options segment. Existing NRI clients with CP codes can choose to exit this mechanism by October 27, 2025, while new NRI clients can directly trade without CP codes.

- Retained flexibility for NRIs who wish to continue with CP code mechanism

- Exit requests to be processed through email communication within 90 days
- Deactivation requests for CP codes with no open positions to be submitted to Clearing Corporation
- Members must implement operational changes to accommodate future exit requests from NRI clients
