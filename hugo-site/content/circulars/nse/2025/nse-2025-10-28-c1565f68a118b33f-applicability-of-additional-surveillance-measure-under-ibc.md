- Consolidated list shows 19 securities remaining under ASM-IBC surveillance
- 9 securities in Stage I, 10 securities under "Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure" category

## Regulatory Changes

The circular maintains the existing ASM-IBC framework with minimal adjustments. The surveillance measure continues to operate in multiple stages:

- **Stage I**: For companies in early stages of IBC proceedings (9 securities)
- **Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure**: For companies that have made IBC-related disclosures (10 securities)

No changes to the surveillance framework rules or criteria are introduced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements
