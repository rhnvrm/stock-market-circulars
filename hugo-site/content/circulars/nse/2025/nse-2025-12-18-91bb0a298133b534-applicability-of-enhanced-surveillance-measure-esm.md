## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- High impact on liquidity for all six affected securities due to Trade-for-Trade restrictions and enhanced margins
- Stage I securities (AGRITECH, AURIGROW, SATECH) will see complete elimination of intraday trading opportunities
- Stage II securities (GSTL, SALSTEEL, TVSELECT) face additional price band constraints limiting price discovery
- 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for traders and investors

**Trading Impact:**
- Increased transaction costs due to mandatory delivery-based trading
- Reduced trading volumes expected due to higher capital requirements
- Limited price movement (2% band) for Stage II securities may deter active traders
- Periodic Call Auction mechanism will reduce trading frequency for Stage II securities

**Investor Impact:**
- Existing position holders must arrange for 100% margin by December 19, 2025
- Short-term traders likely to exit positions due to unfavorable trading conditions
- Long-term investors may face reduced liquidity when attempting to exit positions
- Higher settlement obligations with no intraday square-off possibilities

**Operational Considerations:**
- Brokers must update risk management systems to enforce 100% margin requirements
- Trading systems must reflect segment changes from EQ/SM to BE/ST
- Enhanced monitoring required for compliance with Stage II price band restrictions
- Member firms should proactively communicate changes to clients holding positions in affected securities
