title: Change in Scheme Names of Bandhan Mutual Fund Plans on NSE MF Invest Platform
---

## Summary

Bandhan Mutual Fund has changed the names of eight schemes across three fund categories to enable easy identification against their respective SEBI categories. The changes are effective immediately from December 1, 2025, on the NSE MF Invest platform. The Scheme Information Documents (SID) and Key Information Memorandums (KIM) have been segregated and uploaded on the Mutual Fund's website.

## Key Points

- Changes approved by Boards of Directors of Bandhan Mutual Fund Trustee Limited and Bandhan AMC Limited
- Segregation of SIDs and KIMs for each plan under the schemes
- Asset Allocation Fund of Funds plans recategorized per SEBI Letter dated February 6, 2025 and AMFI communication dated June 30, 2025
- Changes align with SEBI Master Circular for Mutual Funds dated June 27, 2024

## Regulatory Changes

The name changes are made to comply with:
- Para 2.6 of SEBI Master Circular for Mutual Funds dated June 27, 2024
- SEBI Letter dated February 6, 2025 regarding Framework of launching fund of funds (FOF) schemes with multiple underlying funds
- AMFI communication dated June 30, 2025

## Important Dates

- **December 1, 2025**: Effective date of scheme name changes on NSE MF Invest platform
- **November 28, 2025**: End of business hours - Asset Allocation Fund of Funds plans categorized per SEBI/AMFI framework

## Impact Assessment

The changes are purely administrative and cosmetic in nature. There is no impact on:
- Investment objectives or strategies of the schemes
- Portfolio composition or asset allocation
- Existing investor holdings or NAV calculations
- Expense ratios or fund management

Investors should update their records with the new scheme names but no action is required regarding their investments. The renaming improves clarity and alignment with SEBI's categorization framework for mutual fund schemes.
