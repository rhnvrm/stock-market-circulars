title: Connectivity - POP Network Changes - Extension for Self-Service Links
---

## Summary

NSE has extended the migration deadline for self-service connectivity links from existing Sify POP locations to December 26, 2025. This extension applies to members using self-service links at STT Ultadanga Kolkata and Jivan Vihar Delhi POPs. The Telecom Network Integrator (TNI) Sify reported minimal progress on self-service link migrations, prompting this extension based on member representations. Members must complete migration by the revised deadline to ensure continued trading connectivity.

## Key Points

- Migration deadline extended from December 9, 2025 to December 26, 2025 for self-service links only
- Extension applies to two POP locations: STT Kolkata and Jivan Vihar Delhi
- New POP locations are Sify KOL (Kolkata) and Sify OKHLA (Delhi)
- Little progress reported on self-service link migrations by TNI Sify
- Extension granted based on member representations
- Members with self-service links must complete migration to maintain trading connectivity
- Original migration announcement made on August 5, 2025
- Subsequent reminders issued on November 7, 2025 and November 28, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational infrastructure migration with extended compliance timeline.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members with self-service links at affected POPs must migrate to new locations by December 26, 2025
- Members responsible for ensuring migration completion to maintain uninterrupted trading connectivity
- Members should contact TNI Sify using details in Annexure 1 (Sify Handbook) for migration queries
- Contact: Toll Free 1800-266-0050 or msm@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **August 5, 2025**: Initial migration announcement
- **November 7, 2025**: First reminder circular
- **November 28, 2025**: Second reminder circular
- **December 9, 2025**: Original discontinuation date (now extended)
- **December 26, 2025**: Revised discontinuation date for existing POPs (self-service links)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: High - Members who fail to migrate self-service links by December 26, 2025 will lose trading connectivity to the Exchange. This directly affects ability to execute trades and participate in market operations.

**Affected Parties**: Trading members using self-service connectivity model through Sify POPs at Kolkata (STT Ultadanga) and Delhi (Jivan Vihar) locations.

**Mitigation**: Extension provides additional 17 days for members to complete migration. Members must proactively coordinate with Sify TNI to ensure timely completion. NSE acts only as facilitator; connectivity procurement and maintenance is member's responsibility.

**Risk**: Non-compliance results in loss of trading access after December 26, 2025 when existing POPs are discontinued by TNI.
