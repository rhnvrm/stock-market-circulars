## Important Dates

- **December 10, 2025**: Circular issued by NSE
- **December 18, 2025**: Effective date for revocation of suspension
- **December 18, 2025**: Special pre-open session for VIVIMEDLAB
- **January 19, 2023**: Original suspension date (for reference)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Investors who have been unable to trade Vivimed Labs shares for nearly 3 years will regain liquidity. The resumption of trading after a prolonged suspension may see significant price volatility.

**Investor Impact**: High - Existing shareholders who were locked in during the suspension period can now exit or adjust positions. New investors can participate in the stock.

**Trading Restrictions**: The BE series classification and trade-for-trade settlement indicate enhanced surveillance measures, which means higher delivery obligations and no intraday squaring off. This may limit speculative trading but ensures genuine delivery-based transactions.

**Liquidity Considerations**: Initial liquidity may be constrained due to BE series restrictions and the special pre-open session mechanism, which is designed to discover fair opening prices after suspension periods.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and market participants need to ensure their systems and processes are updated to handle trading in this security under BE series restrictions from December 18, 2025.
