## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. The further issuances represent routine ESOP allotments and one preferential allotment, with relatively small quantities compared to the companies' total outstanding shares. The listing of these additional shares is administrative in nature.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal. Trading members need to note the updated share capital and distinctive number ranges, but no changes to trading systems or procedures are required beyond standard updates.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible. The additional shares, particularly from ESOP allotments, are unlikely to significantly affect market liquidity or trading volumes. Indo Thai Securities shows the largest absolute increase (1,010,000 shares), but 510,000 shares are subject to lock-in.

**Investor Consideration:** The further issues are pari passu with existing shares, maintaining equal rights for all shareholders. No dilution concerns for large-cap companies like Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank given the small relative quantities.
