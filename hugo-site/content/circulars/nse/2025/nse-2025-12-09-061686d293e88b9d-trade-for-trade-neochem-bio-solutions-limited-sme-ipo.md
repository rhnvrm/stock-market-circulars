## Summary

National Stock Exchange of India has announced that Neochem Bio Solutions Limited will be transferred from the trade for trade segment (series: ST) to the rolling segment (series: SM) effective from December 23, 2025. This follows the company's SME IPO and is in accordance with SEBI guidelines.

## Key Points

- Neochem Bio Solutions Limited (Symbol: NEOCHEM) will move from trade for trade segment to rolling segment
- Transfer effective date: December 23, 2025
- Current series: ST (trade for trade)

- Action pursuant to SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012
- Follows previous Exchange circular NSE/CML/71693 dated December 08, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The segment transfer is a routine post-IPO process for SME stocks, moving from restricted trade-for-trade mechanism to normal rolling settlement. This allows for intraday trading and standard T+2 settlement cycle instead of compulsory delivery-based trading.

## Compliance Requirements

- All members must note the segment change for NEOCHEM stock
- Trading systems should be updated to reflect the new series (SM) from December 23, 2025
- Members should inform their clients about the change in trading mechanism

- **Effective Date:** December 23, 2025 (segment transfer)
- **Reference Circular:** NSE/CML/71693 dated December 08, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The transfer to rolling segment will enhance liquidity and trading flexibility for Neochem Bio Solutions Limited shares. Investors will be able to conduct intraday trading and benefit from standard settlement mechanisms. This is a positive development that typically occurs after successful IPO listing and initial stabilization period in trade-for-trade segment.
