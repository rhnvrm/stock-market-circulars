## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine administrative circular announcing the listing of privately placed commercial paper on the debt market segment. These securities add to the available debt instruments for institutional investors and qualified buyers.

**Operational Impact**: Debt market participants can now trade these commercial paper securities through the NSE debt market platform using the designated security codes and ISINs.

**Liquidity Impact**: Limited, as commercial paper is typically held to maturity by institutional investors. The short-term nature (20-220 days) and private placement status indicate these are targeted at specific investor classes rather than retail participation.
