## Summary

NSE has issued a surveillance circular applying Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I to 7 securities effective November 25, 2025. The applicable margin rate will be 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at 100%, on all open positions as of November 25, 2025 and new positions from November 26, 2025. Additionally, 2 securities (Indigo Paints Limited and Utssav CZ Gold Jewels Limited) are being excluded from the ASM framework.

## Key Points

- 7 securities shortlisted under ST-ASM Stage I framework effective November 25, 2025
- Margin requirement: 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), maximum capped at 100%
- Margins applicable on all open positions as on November 25, 2025 and new positions from November 26, 2025
- No securities shortlisted under ST-ASM Stage II
- No securities moving between Stage I and Stage II
- 2 securities excluded from ASM framework: INDIGOPNTS and UTSSAV
- ASM framework works in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

The Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework continues as per previous circulars (NSE/SURV/39265, NSE/SURV/46557, NSE/SURV/52144, NSE/SURV/58558, and NSE/SURV/64066). This circular applies the existing framework to newly identified securities that meet the ST-ASM Stage I criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- **For Trading Members**: Ensure margin collection of minimum 50% (or existing margin, whichever is higher) on all open positions and new positions in the 7 listed securities
- **For Market Participants**: Maintain adequate capital/margin for positions in affected securities
- **Reporting**: Members should be aware that ASM framework operates alongside all other surveillance measures
- **For Queries**: Contact surveillance@nse.co.in
- **Reference**: FAQs available at https://www.nseindia.com/regulations/additional-surveillance-measure

## Important Dates

- **November 24, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **November 25, 2025**: Effective date for ST-ASM Stage I applicability on listed securities; margin requirements apply to all open positions as of this date
- **November 26, 2025**: Margin requirements apply to all new positions created from this date onwards

## Securities Affected

### ST-ASM Stage I (Newly Included - 7 Securities)

1. **ARCIIL** - ARC Insulation & Insulators Limited (INE0YDV01010)
2. **CAPTRUST** - Capital Trust Limited (INE707C01018)
3. **DYNAMIC** - Dynamic Services & Security Limited (INE0DZ701010)
4. **MANGALAM** - Mangalam Drugs And Organics Limited (INE584F01014)
5. **OWAIS** - Owais Metal And Mineral Processing Limited (INE0R8M01017)
6. **POSITRON** - Positron Energy Limited (INE0S3H01017)
7. **SPECTRUM** - Spectrum Electrical Industries Limited (INE01EO01010)

2. **UTSSAV** - Utssav CZ Gold Jewels Limited (INE06IJ01010)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The 50% minimum margin requirement represents a significant increase in capital requirements for traders holding positions in these 7 securities. This will reduce leverage and may lead to position unwinding or reduced trading activity.

**Liquidity Impact**: Higher margins typically result in reduced liquidity as fewer participants can afford to maintain positions. Trading volumes in affected securities may decline.

**Risk Management**: The measure is designed to curb excessive speculation and ensure better risk management in securities that have met surveillance criteria.

**Market Participants**: Brokers and traders must ensure adequate margin coverage for existing and new positions to avoid forced liquidation or margin calls.

**Positive Development**: Exclusion of INDIGOPNTS and UTSSAV from ASM framework indicates improved trading patterns in these securities, allowing normal margin requirements to resume.
