## Summary

NSE has issued a surveillance circular implementing Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I on 7 securities effective November 7, 2025. The circular mandates increased margin requirements of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at 100%, effective November 10, 2025. Additionally, 4 securities are being excluded from the ASM framework. This surveillance action is part of NSE's ongoing market monitoring framework and should not be construed as adverse action against the concerned companies.

## Key Points

- 7 securities included in ST-ASM Stage I: Bulkcorp International Limited, Kundan Edifice Limited, Keynote Financial Services Limited, LG Balakrishnan & Bros Limited, Mufin Green Finance Limited, Rajratan Global Wire Limited, and South West Pinnacle Exploration Limited
- Margin requirement: 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at 100%
- No securities moving to or from ST-ASM Stage II
- 4 securities excluded from ASM framework: Arvind Port and Infra Limited, Fabtech Technologies Limited, Galaxy Medicare Limited, and Renol Polychem Limited
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance purposes and not an adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

This circular continues the application of the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework originally established through previous circulars dating back to October 2018. The framework provides for enhanced surveillance on securities meeting specific criteria, with graduated stages of intervention. This update implements Stage I measures on the identified securities.
