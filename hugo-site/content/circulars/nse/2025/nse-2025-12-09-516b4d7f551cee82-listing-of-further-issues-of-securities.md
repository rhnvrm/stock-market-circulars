## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. These are routine ESOP allotments representing small percentages of total outstanding shares. No lock-in restrictions mean shares are immediately tradable, but volumes are relatively small and unlikely to cause significant price movements.

**Trading Impact:** Standard administrative listing with no special trading conditions. Market lot of 1 ensures normal trading liquidity.

**Investor Impact:** Increases float marginally for each company. No material dilution expected given the small number of shares relative to typical market capitalizations of listed companies.
