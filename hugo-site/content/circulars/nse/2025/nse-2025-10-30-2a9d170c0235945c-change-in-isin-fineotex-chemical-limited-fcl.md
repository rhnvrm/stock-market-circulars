## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Share sub-division typically increases liquidity by reducing share price and making shares more accessible to retail investors. The ISIN change itself is administrative.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members and depositories need to update their systems to reflect the new ISIN. However, this is a standard corporate action with clear timelines.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their holdings doubled (2:1 split) with proportionate reduction in share price, maintaining the same total investment value.
