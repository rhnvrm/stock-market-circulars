## Summary

National Stock Exchange of India has announced a change in the ISIN code for equity shares of Sikko Industries Limited (SIKKO) effective November 27, 2025. The change is necessitated by a sub-division of shares from face value of Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/-. The new ISIN code INE112X01025 will be applicable for all trades executed on or after the ex-date.

## Key Points

- Company: Sikko Industries Limited
- Symbol: SIKKO
- New ISIN: INE112X01025
- Reason: Sub-division of shares from Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/-
- Ex-date: November 27, 2025
- Circular Reference: NSE/CML/71408, Circular No. 2266/2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action implementation requiring ISIN code modification in the exchange's trading and settlement systems.

## Compliance Requirements

- Exchange members must update their systems with the new ISIN code INE112X01025 before the ex-date
- All trades executed on or after November 27, 2025 must use the new ISIN
- Members should ensure proper mapping of the new ISIN in their trading terminals and back-office systems

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: November 21, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: November 27, 2025 (new ISIN becomes effective)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10 times while proportionately reducing the price, potentially improving liquidity and making shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members and market participants must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN code. Failure to update systems timely could result in trade rejections or settlement issues.

**Investor Impact**: Neutral to positive - Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held. The total investment value remains unchanged, but increased liquidity may benefit trading activity.
