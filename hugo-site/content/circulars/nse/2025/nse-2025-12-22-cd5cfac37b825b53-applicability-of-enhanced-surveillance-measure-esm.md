title: Applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM)
---

## Summary

NSE has issued circular 986/2025 regarding the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework. Two securities - Arvee Laboratories (India) Limited (ARVEE) and TCI Finance Limited (TCIFINANCE) - have been shortlisted for inclusion under ESM Stage-I. These securities will attract a minimum 100% margin requirement and will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST) effective December 24, 2025. No securities are being excluded from the ESM framework or moving between stages.

## Key Points

- Two securities added to ESM Stage-I: ARVEE (INE006Z01016) and TCIFINANCE (INE911B01018)
- 100% margin requirement applicable on all open positions as on December 23, 2025 and new positions from December 24, 2025
- Securities will shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST) from December 24, 2025
- No securities are eligible to move out from ESM framework
- No securities moving between Stage-I and Stage-II
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely on account of market surveillance and not an adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework established under previous circulars NSE/SURV/56948, NSE/SURV/57609, NSE/SURV/63361, NSE/SURV/64066, NSE/SURV/64400, and NSE/SURV/69315. The framework enables NSE to impose additional surveillance measures on securities meeting specific criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure 100% margin is maintained on ARVEE and TCIFINANCE positions
- Margin requirement applies to: (1) All open positions as on December 23, 2025, and (2) New positions created from December 24, 2025
- Trading members must adapt to Trade-for-Trade segment rules for these securities from December 24, 2025
- Securities in Stage-II will trade under periodic call auction with 2% price band

## Important Dates

- **December 22, 2025**: Circular issued
- **December 23, 2025**: 100% margin applies to existing open positions; Stage-II securities move to periodic call auction with 2% price band
- **December 24, 2025**: 100% margin applies to new positions; Securities shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST segment

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The shift to Trade-for-Trade segment eliminates intraday trading opportunities and requires delivery-based settlement for ARVEE and TCIFINANCE. This significantly reduces liquidity and trading volumes.

**Margin Impact**: The 100% margin requirement substantially increases capital requirements for holding positions in these securities, likely deterring speculative trading activity.

**Market Participant Impact**: Traders and investors with existing positions must arrange for increased margin by December 23, 2025. The enhanced surveillance signals elevated risk profile for these securities.

**Price Discovery**: Trade-for-Trade mechanism may impact price discovery due to reduced trading activity and liquidity constraints.
