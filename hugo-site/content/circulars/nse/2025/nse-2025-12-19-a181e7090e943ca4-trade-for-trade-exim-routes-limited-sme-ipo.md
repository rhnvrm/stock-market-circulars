## Summary

NSE has announced that Exim Routes Limited will be transferred from the trade for trade segment (Series: ST) to the rolling segment (Series: SM) effective January 05, 2026. This is a follow-up to Exchange Circular NSE/CML/71887 dated December 18, 2025 and is in line with SEBI guidelines (CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012).

## Key Points

- Security Symbol: EXIMROUTES
- Company Name: Exim Routes Limited
- Current Segment: Trade for Trade (Series: ST)
- New Segment: Rolling Segment (Series: SM)
- Effective Date: January 05, 2026
- Reference: Previous circular NSE/CML/71887 dated December 18, 2025
- Regulatory Framework: SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012

## Regulatory Changes

This transfer is pursuant to SEBI guidelines on post-IPO segment migration for SME securities. The trade for trade segment is a restrictive segment typically used for newly listed securities or those under surveillance, where intraday trading is not permitted. Migration to rolling segment allows normal trading with T+1 settlement.

## Compliance Requirements

- All members should note the segment change for EXIMROUTES
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new series designation (SM instead of ST)
- Investors can engage in normal rolling settlement trading from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **December 18, 2025**: Previous circular NSE/CML/71887 issued
- **December 19, 2025**: Current circular issued
- **January 05, 2026**: Effective date for segment transfer

## Impact Assessment

The impact is minimal and positive for investors. The transfer from trade for trade to rolling segment provides:

- Increased liquidity as intraday trading becomes permitted
- Normal T+1 settlement cycle
- Reduced trading restrictions
- Enhanced market accessibility for the security

This is a standard post-IPO process for SME securities and indicates successful completion of the initial listing requirements.
