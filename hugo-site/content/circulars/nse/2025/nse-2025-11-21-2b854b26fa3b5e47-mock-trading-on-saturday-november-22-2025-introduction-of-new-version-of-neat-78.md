## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - All trading members must participate in mandatory mock trading session and upgrade to new NEAT+ version. The system upgrade requires technical preparation but follows standard NSE upgrade procedures.

**Market Impact**: Low - Mock trading occurs on a non-trading day (Saturday) with no impact on live markets.

**Member Readiness**: Members have adequate notice (download available from November 21, 19:00 hrs) to prepare for the November 22 mock session. The two-session format allows comprehensive testing of the new platform version.

**System Migration**: Phased discontinuation approach provides buffer period - version 7.8.4 remains available until December 6, 2025, allowing smooth transition for members who may face issues with the new version.
