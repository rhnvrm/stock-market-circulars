title: Password Encryption for EBP Segment - Mandatory Password Reset
---

## Summary

NSE is implementing enhanced security measures to improve cyber resilience for the EBP (Electronic Book Provider) Segment application. All users must perform a mandatory one-time password reset after end of day November 14, 2025. Users will be prompted to reset their password upon successful validation of existing credentials, and access will only be granted after completing the password reset.

## Key Points

- Enhanced security measures being implemented for EBP Segment application
- Mandatory one-time password reset required for all users
- Password reset must be completed on or after end of day November 14, 2025
- Users will be automatically prompted to reset password after validating existing credentials
- System access will be blocked until password reset is successfully completed
- Measure aims to reinforce security and improve cyber resilience

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a technical security implementation to enhance system protection and cyber resilience for the EBP Segment platform.

## Compliance Requirements

- All EBP Segment users must mandatorily reset their passwords on or after November 14, 2025
- Password reset must be completed before gaining access to the application
- Market participants should proactively plan for password reset to avoid login issues
- Existing credentials will be validated first, then users will be prompted for mandatory password change

## Important Dates

- **November 14, 2025 (End of Day)**: Deadline after which mandatory password reset becomes effective
- Users logging in after this date will be required to reset passwords before accessing the system

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: High - All EBP Segment users will experience a one-time disruption requiring password reset. Failure to complete the reset will result in inability to access the system, potentially affecting debt segment trading operations.

**Market Impact**: Low to Medium - While this is a technical security measure, any delays in password reset by participants could temporarily impact their ability to participate in debt segment activities.

**Security Impact**: Positive - Enhanced password encryption and mandatory reset improves overall cyber security posture and system resilience against potential security threats.
