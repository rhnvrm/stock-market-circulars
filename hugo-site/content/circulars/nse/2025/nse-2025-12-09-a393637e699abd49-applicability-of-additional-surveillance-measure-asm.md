## Summary

NSE has issued surveillance measures under the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework affecting three securities. Two securities (ARVEE and DELPHIFX) have been placed in Stage-I requiring 100% margin. One security (SABTNL) is being moved from Stage-I to Stage-IV and will be shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ series) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE series). These measures take effect from December 12, 2025.

## Key Points

- 100% margin requirement applicable on all open positions as on December 11, 2025 and new positions from December 12, 2025 onwards
- SABTNL (Sri Adhikari Brothers Television Network Limited) to be shifted from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely on surveillance grounds and not an adverse action against the company
