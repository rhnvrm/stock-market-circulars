## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - requires members and custodians to carefully manage ISIN transitions during the split period. Incorrect ISIN usage could result in settlement failures or loss of margin benefits.

**Market Impact**: Limited to members trading BHARATRAS during the December 12-15, 2025 window. The dual ISIN period requires additional operational attention.

**Member Benefits**: Proper execution of early pay-in allows members to receive margin exemption benefits while ensuring smooth settlement during the corporate action.

**Risk Mitigation**: Clear procedural guidance reduces settlement risk and ensures proper client benefit allocation, particularly for custodians using pool accounts.
