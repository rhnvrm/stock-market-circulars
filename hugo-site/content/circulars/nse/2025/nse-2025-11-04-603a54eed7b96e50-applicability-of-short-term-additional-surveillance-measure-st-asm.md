## Regulatory Changes

The Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework applies enhanced margin requirements to securities that satisfy specific surveillance criteria. The applicable surveillance actions for ST-ASM Stage I include:

- Margin rate set at 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher
- Maximum margin capped at 100%
- Applies to all open positions as on October 06, 2025
- Applies to all new positions created from October 07, 2025

The ASM framework is designed to work alongside other surveillance measures imposed by the exchange and is subject to periodic review based on market conditions and security-specific factors.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must ensure adequate margin collection from clients for the affected securities
- **Margin Collection**: Enhanced margins must be collected starting October 07, 2025
- **Position Monitoring**: Both existing positions (as on October 06, 2025) and new positions require the enhanced margin
- **Risk Management**: Members should update their risk management systems to reflect the new margin requirements
- **Client Communication**: Members should inform clients about the enhanced margin requirements for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **November 04, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 06, 2025**: Reference date for existing open positions
- **October 07, 2025**: Enhanced margin requirements become applicable
- **November 06, 2025**: Effective date for inclusion/exclusion of securities under ST-ASM framework

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Trading activity in the 5 securities under ST-ASM Stage I may decrease due to higher margin requirements
- Increased cost of carry for positions in affected securities
- Potential reduction in speculative trading activity
- Positive impact on 6 securities excluded from ASM framework, as they return to normal margin requirements

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers need to adjust margin collection systems for affected securities
- Enhanced monitoring required for compliance with new margin levels
- Client communication and education necessary regarding changed requirements

**Risk Management:**
- Higher margins reduce systemic risk by limiting leverage in securities under surveillance
- Enhanced surveillance serves as an early warning mechanism for potential market irregularities
- The measure is precautionary and does not reflect adversely on the fundamental quality of the companies

**Investor Considerations:**
- Traders and investors in affected securities will need higher capital allocation
- Position sizes may need to be adjusted based on available margin
- Removal of 6 securities from ASM provides trading relief and normalized margin requirements
