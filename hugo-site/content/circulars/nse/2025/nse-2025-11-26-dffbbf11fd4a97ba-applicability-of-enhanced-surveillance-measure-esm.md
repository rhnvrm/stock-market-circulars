## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework as established under previous NSE circulars (NSE/SURV/56948, NSE/SURV/57609, NSE/SURV/63361, NSE/SURV/64066, NSE/SURV/64400, and NSE/SURV/69315). The measure applies stricter trading restrictions and margin requirements on securities meeting specific surveillance criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must ensure 100% margin collection on SHUBHLAXMI for all open positions as on November 27, 2025
- **All Market Participants**: Must trade SHUBHLAXMI only in Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST series) from November 28, 2025
- **Margin Collection**: Minimum 100% margin required on all new positions created from November 28, 2025
- **Settlement**: All trades must be settled on a delivery basis in Trade-for-Trade segment (no intraday squaring off)

## Important Dates

- **November 26, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **November 27, 2025**: ESM Stage-I applicability begins; 100% margin applies to open positions
- **November 28, 2025**: Securities shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST series; 100% margin applies to new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The shift to Trade-for-Trade segment eliminates intraday trading opportunities and requires compulsory delivery, significantly reducing liquidity and trading flexibility for SHUBHLAXMI.

**Capital Impact**: The 100% margin requirement substantially increases capital requirements for traders holding positions in the affected security, as compared to normal VaR-based margins.

**Market Participants**: Investors and traders in SHUBHLAXMI must prepare for reduced liquidity, wider bid-ask spreads, and higher capital requirements. Existing position holders as of November 27, 2025 will face immediate margin impact.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers must update their risk management systems to enforce 100% margins and restrict trading to Trade-for-Trade segment for the affected security.
