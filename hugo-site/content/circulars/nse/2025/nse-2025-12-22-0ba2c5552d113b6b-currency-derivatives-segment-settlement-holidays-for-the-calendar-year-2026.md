**Market Impact:** Low - This is routine annual information that allows market participants to plan operations well in advance. No disruption expected as holidays are pre-announced.

**Trading Impact:** Settlement activities will be suspended on these dates, requiring participants to adjust their position management and funding arrangements accordingly. The concentration of holidays in March-April (6 holidays) and during festival season (October-November) requires particular attention for liquidity planning.
