## Impact Assessment

This listing enables shareholders of Allcargo Terminals Limited who participated in the rights issue to trade their partly paid-up shares on NSE. The partly paid-up nature means shareholders have paid Re. 0.50 of the Rs. 2 face value (Rs. 5 of Rs. 20 issue price on application). The large quantity of shares (nearly 40 million) indicates a substantial rights issue that may impact trading volumes and liquidity for the company's securities. No lock-in period applies, allowing immediate tradability upon listing.
