title: Non-Business Day for certain schemes of Mutual Fund on NSE MF Invest Platform
  for November 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has notified members about non-business days for certain mutual fund schemes on the NSE MF Invest Platform for November 2025. On November 27, 2025, subscriptions, redemptions, switches, SIPs, STPs, and SWPs will not be allowed for specified schemes from Axis Mutual Fund and DSP Mutual Fund.

## Key Points

- Non-business day effective date: November 27, 2025
- Affects schemes from two AMCs: Axis and DSP
- All transaction types blocked: Subscriptions, Redemptions, Switches, SIPs, STPs, SWPs
- Applies to Fund of Fund schemes and other equity/multi-asset schemes
- Axis schemes affected include Global Equity Alpha FoF and Global Innovation FoF (all plan variants)
- DSP schemes affected include US Specific Equity Omni FoF, Value Fund, Healthcare Fund, Global Innovation Overseas Equity Omni FoF, Multi Asset Allocation Fund, and World Gold Mining Overseas Equity Omni FoF
- Both Direct and Regular plans across Growth, IDCW Payout, and IDCW Reinvestment options are impacted

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational notice based on communications received from the respective mutual funds regarding their business calendar.

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must ensure no transactions are processed for the listed schemes on November 27, 2025
- Members should inform their clients about the non-availability of these schemes on the specified date
- The restriction applies across all transaction types on the NSE MF Invest platform

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 31, 2025
- **Non-Business Day**: November 27, 2025 (likely due to US Thanksgiving holiday affecting international fund of funds)

## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it affects only specific mutual fund schemes for a single day. The primary impact is operational, requiring investors planning transactions in these schemes to schedule them before or after November 27, 2025. The non-business day likely corresponds with the US Thanksgiving holiday, which affects the underlying international markets for Fund of Funds schemes. Investors with scheduled SIPs, STPs, or SWPs on this date should be aware that these automated transactions will not be processed.
