## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. The number of shares being listed represents routine ESOP allotments that are typically small relative to the total outstanding equity of these established companies. The absence of lock-in restrictions allows immediate trading, but the volume is unlikely to significantly affect market liquidity or stock prices. This is a standard administrative listing procedure.
