## Summary

National Stock Exchange of India has issued a circular notifying the suspension of trading in non-convertible securities (privately placed) of Indian Bank. The suspension is effective December 10, 2025, and is being implemented due to redemption for exercising call option, as per Regulation 3.1.2 of the NSE Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A.

## Key Points

- Single non-convertible security affected: Indian Bank (ISIN: INE562A08057)
- Suspension effective date: December 10, 2025
- Reason: Redemption for exercising call option
- Circular issued under NSE Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A, Regulation 3.1.2
- Circular Reference: NSE/CML/71697, Circular No. 2382/2025

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- All members of NSE are notified of the suspension
- Trading in the specified ISIN must cease from December 10, 2025
- No new trades can be executed in this security after the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: December 09, 2025
- **Suspension Effective Date**: December 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This affects a single privately placed non-convertible security. Privately placed debt securities typically have limited secondary market trading and are held by institutional investors.

**Issuer**: Indian Bank - A public sector bank with multiple debt instruments outstanding. The suspension of one instrument due to scheduled redemption is a routine corporate action.

**Investors**: Holders of this specific ISIN should be aware that trading will be suspended, though the suspension is due to redemption via call option exercise, meaning investors will receive their principal and applicable interest as per the terms of the instrument.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - This is a standard suspension procedure for debt securities approaching redemption.
