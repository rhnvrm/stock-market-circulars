title: Migration of Services from CIM to NMASS
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited is discontinuing the Collateral Interface for Members (CIM) and migrating all collateral management services to NMASS (N-MASS) platform. This migration is part of NSE's initiative to provide a single member interface. The CIM platform will be discontinued effective December 15, 2025, and all functionalities will be available exclusively on NMASS from that date.

## Key Points

- CIM platform will be completely discontinued on December 15, 2025
- All collateral management functionalities migrating to NMASS with no process changes
- Super Admin users can create or modify roles starting December 01, 2025
- Three main service categories being migrated: Collateral Release, EMI, and Reports
- User manual for NMASS functionalities provided in annexure
- No changes to existing processes, only platform interface changes
- Rights management through Super Admin user in NMASS

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational platform migration initiative by NSE Clearing to consolidate member services onto a single interface (NMASS).

## Compliance Requirements

### For Clearing Members and Custodians:

1. **Role Creation/Modification**: Super Admin users must create or modify user roles in NMASS before December 15, 2025
2. **User Access Setup**: Assign appropriate roles for the migrated services to relevant users
3. **Platform Transition**: Transition from CIM to NMASS for all collateral management operations

### Services Being Migrated:

**1. Collateral Release:**
- New Request/Inquiry
- Data Export
- File Upload
- Download Return Files
- Instruction wise File upload

**2. EMI (Early Margin Intimation):**
- Cash Deposit

**3. Reports:**

## Important Dates

- **December 01, 2025**: Super Admin users can start creating or modifying roles in NMASS
- **December 15, 2025**: CIM services discontinued; all services available exclusively on NMASS

## Impact Assessment

### Operational Impact:

**High Impact** - This is a critical operational change affecting all clearing members and custodians in the currency derivatives segment. 

**Key Impacts:**

1. **Platform Transition**: All users must migrate from familiar CIM interface to NMASS
2. **User Management**: Super Admin users must proactively set up roles and permissions before deadline
3. **Risk of Service Disruption**: Failure to complete role setup before December 15, 2025 will result in operational challenges and inability to access collateral management services
4. **Training Requirements**: Users may need familiarization with NMASS interface, though processes remain unchanged
5. **Single Interface Benefit**: Long-term benefit of consolidated platform for all member services

### Affected Parties:
- All clearing members in currency derivatives segment
- Custodians
- Portfolio Clearing Members (PCM)
- Super Admin users (immediate action required)
