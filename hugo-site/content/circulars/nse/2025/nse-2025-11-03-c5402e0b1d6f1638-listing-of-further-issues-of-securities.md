## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. These are routine ESOP allotments that marginally increase the paid-up capital of the respective companies. The quantities are relatively small compared to the existing float of these listed companies.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems with the new distinctive number ranges and total paid-up capital for accurate position tracking.

**Investor Impact**: ESOP allotments typically have negligible dilution effect and no lock-in restrictions mean these shares are immediately tradable, though unlikely to materially affect stock prices.
