title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities Movement and Updates
---

## Summary

NSE has announced changes to securities under Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective November 28 and December 01, 2025. Two new securities are added to ESM Stage-I, two securities move from Stage-I to Stage-II, and all affected securities will shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM series) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST series). A minimum 100% margin will be applicable on all open and new positions.

## Key Points

- Two securities added to ESM Stage-I: SVP Global Textiles Limited and Systango Technologies Limited
- Two securities moving from Stage-I to Stage-II: Dhariwalcorp Limited and TechD Cybersecurity Limited
- Securities in Stage-I will shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST series effective December 01, 2025
- Stage-II securities will be under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction from November 28, 2025
- 100% margin requirement applies to all open positions as on November 28, 2025, and new positions from December 01, 2025
- No securities excluded from ESM framework in this update
- No securities moving from Stage-II back to Stage-I

## Regulatory Changes

- Imposition of Enhanced Surveillance Measure on identified securities based on market surveillance criteria
- Mandatory shift from Rolling Settlement segment to Trade-for-Trade segment for ESM Stage-I securities
- Implementation of Periodic Call Auction mechanism with restricted 2% price band for Stage-II securities
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures imposed by the Exchange

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must ensure compliance with 100% margin requirement for affected securities
- Trading members need to adapt to Trade-for-Trade settlement for securities moving from EQ/SM to BE/ST series
- Market participants must comply with 2% price band restrictions under Periodic Call Auction for Stage-II securities
- Investors should note restricted trading conditions and liquidity constraints in affected securities
- For queries, members should contact surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **November 27, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 28, 2025**: Stage-II securities come under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction; 100% margin applicable on open positions
- **December 01, 2025**: Securities shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST); 100% margin on new positions begins

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Severely restricted liquidity for affected securities due to Trade-for-Trade mechanism eliminating intraday trading and squaring off positions. The 2% price band for Stage-II securities further limits price discovery.

**Margin Impact**: 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for traders holding positions in these securities, potentially forcing position unwinding.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors face reduced liquidity, wider bid-ask spreads, and difficulty in entering or exiting positions. Settlement becomes T+1 with no intraday leverage.

**Market Sentiment**: ESM designation, while not an adverse action against companies, typically signals heightened volatility or unusual price movements, potentially deterring investor participation.

**Affected Securities**: 
- SVP Global Textiles Limited (SVPGLOB) - Stage-I
- Systango Technologies Limited (SYSTANGO) - Stage-I  
- Dhariwalcorp Limited (DHARIWAL) - Moving to Stage-II
- TechD Cybersecurity Limited (TECHD) - Moving to Stage-II
