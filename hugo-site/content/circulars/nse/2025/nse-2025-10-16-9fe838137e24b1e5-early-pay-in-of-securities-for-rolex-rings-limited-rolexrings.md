---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued guidelines for early pay-in of securities for Rolex Rings Limited (ROLEXRINGS) in connection with a face value split corporate action. The stock will undergo subdivision from Rs 10/- per share to Re 1/- per share, with both record date and ex-date on October 17, 2025. Members and custodians must follow specific procedures for early pay-in using old and new ISINs depending on the settlement date.

## Key Points

- Face value split: Rs 10/- per share to Re 1/- per share (1:10 ratio)
- Existing/Old ISIN: INE645S01016
- Record Date and Ex-Date: October 17, 2025
- Early pay-in on October 17, 2025 (Settlement 2025199) must use old/existing ISIN
- Early pay-in on October 20, 2025 (Settlements 2025199 & 2025200) transitions to new ISIN
- For sale of 10 shares, early pay-in should be 1 share in old ISIN before record date
- After record date, use new ISIN for pay-in/early pay-in instructions
- Block mechanism per SEBI circular NCL/CMPT/53386 dated August 22, 2022 must be followed
- Client-wise early pay-in allocation file should NOT be uploaded when using block mechanism

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements existing early pay-in framework (Item 10.18 of consolidated circular NCL/CMPT/67751 dated April 29, 2025) for a specific corporate action.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Members**: Execute early pay-in instructions in old ISIN (INE645S01016) for trades on October 17, 2025, without adjusting for conversion ratio
- **Custodians**: Upload client-wise early pay-in allocation details based on actual traded quantity (not adjusted quantity) when using pool accounts
- **Custodians**: Do NOT upload client-wise allocation file when using block mechanism
- **All Participants**: Adhere to block mechanism requirements per NCL circular NCL/CMPT/53386 dated August 22, 2022
- **Post Record Date**: Switch to new ISIN for all pay-in and early pay-in instructions after October 17, 2025

## Important Dates

- **October 16, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **October 17, 2025**: Record date and ex-date for face value split
- **October 17, 2025**: Early pay-in date using old ISIN (Settlement 2025199)
- **October 20, 2025**: Early pay-in date using new ISIN (Settlements 2025199 & 2025200)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to traders and custodians dealing with Rolex Rings Limited securities during the transition period.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Members and custodians must carefully track ISIN usage based on settlement dates. The 1:10 split ratio requires adjustment calculations for early pay-in quantities. Using incorrect ISIN or quantities could result in settlement failures or margin calculation errors.

**Client Impact**: Clients undertaking sale transactions must ensure proper blocking mechanism compliance. Custodians must correctly allocate early pay-in benefits based on actual traded quantities, not adjusted quantities.

**Risk**: Potential for operational errors during the transition if members fail to use correct ISIN for respective settlement dates or miscalculate conversion quantities.
