## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The listing introduces a new hospitality sector entity to NSE's Capital Market segment with substantial share capital. Initial trade-for-trade restrictions may limit liquidity but provide price discovery protection.

**Corporate Structure Impact**: The scheme involves complex corporate restructuring including amalgamation of wholly-owned subsidiary (Esteem Properties Private Limited into Valor Estate Limited) and demerger of hospitality business into Advent Hotels International Limited. This creates a focused hospitality business entity.

**Trading Impact**: Initial listing in 'BE' series means trade-for-trade settlement with compulsory delivery, which may impact trading volumes initially. Transition to 'EQ' series will be subject to SEBI guidelines and compliance requirements.

**Investor Impact**: Lock-in provisions apply as per Annexure I, restricting immediate liquidity for certain shareholders. The pari passu nature ensures equal rights with any existing shares.
