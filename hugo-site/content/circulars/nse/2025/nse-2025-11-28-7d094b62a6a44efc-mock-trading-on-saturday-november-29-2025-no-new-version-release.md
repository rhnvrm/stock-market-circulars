**Operational Impact:** Medium for trading members who need to:
- Allocate resources for Saturday mock session participation
- Test new algorithmic trading safeguards
- Prepare systems for upcoming version changes
- Submit participation evidence to NSE

**Member Preparedness:** The mock session provides an opportunity for members to test their systems and ensure readiness for the algorithmic trading requirements before they become mandatory under the SEBI glide path.

**Technology Impact:** Members using NEAT+ version 7.8.4 should prepare for eventual migration as version 7.8.6 will be discontinued in the December 06, 2025 mock session.
