## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The listing creates a new tradeable security on NSE, affecting approximately 18.4 million shares. Shareholders of Khadim India Limited will now hold shares in two separate entities post-demerger.

**Operational Impact**: The demerger separates the distribution business into a standalone listed entity, potentially allowing for focused management and valuation. Initial Trade-for-Trade classification may limit liquidity until migration to EQ series.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing Khadim India Limited shareholders receive shares in KSR Footwear Limited in 1:1 ratio without any payment, maintaining their proportional economic interest in the demerged distribution business.
