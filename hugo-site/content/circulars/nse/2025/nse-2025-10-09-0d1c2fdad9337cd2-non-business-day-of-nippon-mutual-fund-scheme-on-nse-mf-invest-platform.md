## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a single-day operational closure affecting only one mutual fund scheme (Nippon India Taiwan Equity Fund) likely due to a holiday in Taiwan markets. Investors planning transactions in this specific fund should note the non-business day and plan accordingly. Other mutual fund schemes and market operations remain unaffected.
