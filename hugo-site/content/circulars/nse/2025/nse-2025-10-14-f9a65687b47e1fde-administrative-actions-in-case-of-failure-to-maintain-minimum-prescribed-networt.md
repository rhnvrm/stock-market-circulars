## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued Circular No. 32/2025 introducing an escalating penalty framework for clearing members who repeatedly report shortfall in minimum prescribed networth. This circular supplements the earlier Circular No. NCL/CMPL/67927 dated May 08, 2025, which mandated a penalty of Rs. 50,000 for networth shortfalls. The new framework introduces progressive penalties for repeated violations, with the fourth instance being referred to the Member Committee for suitable action. These provisions are effective immediately.

## Key Points

- All Clearing Members, Self Clearing Members, and Professional Clearing Members must maintain minimum networth at all times as per SEBI Gazette Notification No. SEBI/LAD-NRO/GN/2022/73 dated February 23, 2022
- First instance of networth shortfall: Penalty of Rs. 50,000 (as per previous circular)
- Second instance: 50% escalation on the base penalty
- Third instance: 100% escalation on the base penalty
- Fourth instance: Case referred to Member Committee for suitable action
- Penal actions are in addition to blocking of deposits as provided in earlier circular

## Regulatory Changes

This circular introduces a progressive penalty structure for repeated networth shortfall violations:

| Instance | Penalty |
|----------|--------|
| 1st | Rs. 50,000 |
| 2nd | 50% escalation |
| 3rd | 100% escalation |
| 4th | Referral to Member Committee |

The framework builds upon the existing regulatory requirement under SEBI Gazette Notification No. SEBI/LAD-NRO/GN/2022/73 dated February 23, 2022, which prescribes minimum networth requirements for clearing membership.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Clearing Members/Self Clearing Members/Professional Clearing Members** must:
  - Maintain minimum prescribed networth at all times
  - Ensure compliance with networth requirements as per SEBI regulations
  - Avoid repeated instances of networth shortfall reporting to prevent escalating penalties
  - Be prepared for Member Committee review in case of fourth violation

- Deposits may be blocked in addition to monetary penalties for networth shortfall violations

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 14, 2025
- **Effective Date**: Immediate effect from October 14, 2025
- **Reference Circular**: NCL/CMPL/67927 dated May 08, 2025
- **SEBI Notification Reference**: SEBI/LAD-NRO/GN/2022/73 dated February 23, 2022

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Clearing Members**: This circular significantly increases the compliance burden and financial consequences for clearing members who fail to maintain minimum networth requirements. The escalating penalty structure serves as a strong deterrent against repeated violations, with potential referral to the Member Committee representing serious regulatory action that could impact membership status.

**Operational Impact**: Clearing members must strengthen their internal financial monitoring systems to ensure continuous compliance with networth requirements and avoid the progressive penalty structure. The fourth violation triggers Member Committee review, which could result in more severe actions including potential suspension or termination of membership.

**Market Integrity**: The measure enhances overall market safety by ensuring that clearing members maintain adequate financial resources to meet their obligations, thereby reducing systemic risk in the clearing and settlement process.
