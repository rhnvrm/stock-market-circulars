## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine administrative action for listing additional shares from ESOP exercises and preferential allotments. The quantities involved are relatively small compared to the existing paid-up capital of these companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact on liquidity. ESOP shares are typically not locked-in and may be traded freely, while preferential allotment shares face lock-in restrictions ranging from 6 months to 18 months.

**Investor Impact**: Neutral. Existing shareholders should be aware of the dilution effect, though this information was likely already disclosed in respective company announcements. The pari passu nature ensures equal rights for new shares.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new distinctive number ranges and ensure proper settlement for these additional securities from November 18, 2025.
