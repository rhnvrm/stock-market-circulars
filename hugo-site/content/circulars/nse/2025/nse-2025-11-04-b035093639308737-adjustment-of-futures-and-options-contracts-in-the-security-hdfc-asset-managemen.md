- Options positions will be multiplied by adjusted market lot
- Mark-to-market settlement on November 25, 2025 based on daily settlement price before adjustment

## Compliance Requirements

**For All Members:**

- Communicate the impact of adjustments to clients holding HDFCAMC F&O positions
- Monitor margin requirements post-adjustment

- Update risk management systems to reflect new contract specifications

**For Trading Members:**
- Inform clients about position adjustments before ex-date
- Ensure clients understand the impact on their open positions
- Update trading systems to reflect adjusted contract parameters

## Important Dates

- **November 25, 2025**: Last day before adjustment; contracts expiring this date will NOT be adjusted; mark-to-market settlement based on daily settlement price
- **November 26, 2025**: Ex-date for bonus issue; adjusted positions take effect; begin-of-day margins computed based on adjusted carry forward value; normal mark-to-market procedures resume

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- All traders with open HDFCAMC F&O positions will see their contract quantities doubled
- Strike prices for options will be halved
- Futures prices will be halved to maintain equivalent value
- Trading participants need to adjust their risk models and position sizing strategies

**Operational Impact:**
- High impact on clearing and trading systems requiring configuration updates
- Position reconciliation required post-adjustment
- Margin calculations will be based on adjusted parameters from November 26, 2025
- Intra-day margins will be computed based on traded prices at the time of generation

**Example (Futures):**
- Pre-adjustment: 150 long contracts, settlement price X
- Post-adjustment: 300 long contracts (150 × 2), futures price X/2
- Carry forward value remains same: Pre-adjusted quantity × Pre-adjusted settlement price

**Trader Considerations:**
- No action required for contracts expiring November 25, 2025
- Long-term positions (December 2025 and beyond) will be automatically adjusted
- Effective lot size doubles while price halves, maintaining notional value
- Options traders should note strike price changes when managing strategies
