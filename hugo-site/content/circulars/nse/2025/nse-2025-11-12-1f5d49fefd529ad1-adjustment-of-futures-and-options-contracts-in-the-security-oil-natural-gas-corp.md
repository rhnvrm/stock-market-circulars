For options contracts, Rs. 6 will be deducted from all cum-dividend strike prices on the ex-dividend date and adjusted to nearest tick size. This circular implements the adjustment procedures outlined in NSE Circular No. 191/2025 dated November 11, 2025.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - affects all outstanding ONGC futures and options positions across all expiries (November, December, January contracts mentioned in examples). The Rs. 6 dividend adjustment will cause immediate P&L impact for all position holders on November 13, 2025.

**Operational Impact:** High - clearing members must ensure their systems correctly process the adjustment. Futures positions will show automatic value reduction of Rs. 6 per share (Rs. 13,500 per lot for 2,250 quantity). Options positions will be remapped to new strike prices, requiring strike price master updates.

**Risk Management Impact:** Medium - margin calculations will be based on adjusted values from November 14, 2025. Members should monitor margin requirements as begin of day margins will reflect adjusted carry forward values, potentially triggering margin calls or releasing excess margins.

**Trading Impact:** Medium - ex-dividend trading from November 14, 2025 will be at adjusted levels. Market participants should note that futures prices will not directly reflect spot price relationship until market forces equilibrate post-adjustment.
