## Regulatory Changes

The segment transfer is being implemented pursuant to SEBI guidelines under circular reference no. CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012, which governs the framework for moving securities between different trading segments.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance actions are required from members or market participants. The exchange will execute the segment transfer administratively. Members should note the change in trading series from ST to SM for this security.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** December 31, 2025
- **Effective Date:** January 14, 2026 - Dhara Rail Projects Limited will commence trading in rolling segment (Series: SM)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** The transfer from trade for trade (T2T) to rolling segment provides enhanced liquidity and trading flexibility for DHARARAIL. In the rolling segment, the stock can be traded for intraday positions, unlike the T2T segment which requires compulsory delivery. This typically attracts more trading interest and improves price discovery.

**Market Participants:** Brokers and traders can now engage in intraday trading in DHARARAIL shares, which was previously restricted under the T2T framework. This change is standard practice for SME IPO stocks after initial listing stabilization period.
