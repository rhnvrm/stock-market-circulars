## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it is a routine NFO launch announcement. The impact is limited to:

- **Investors**: Provides a new investment avenue in the smallcap equity segment through an ETF structure tracking the Nifty Smallcap 250 index
- **Distributors/Members**: Need to configure systems to enable NFO subscriptions on the NSE MF Invest Platform
- **Market Operations**: Standard operational procedures for NFO processing apply

The launch expands DSP Mutual Fund's ETF offerings and provides investors with passive exposure to India's smallcap segment. No compliance burden or trading disruptions are expected.
