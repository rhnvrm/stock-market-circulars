title: Revoke of SIP Registration in HDFC Defence Fund on NSE MF Invest Platform
---

## Summary

NSE has resumed accepting fresh Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) registrations for HDFC Defence Fund on the NSE MF Invest Platform effective December 23, 2025. This partially modifies the previous restrictions imposed via addendum dated July 08, 2024. Fresh SIP registrations are now permitted only under monthly frequency with a limit of up to ₹5,000 per investor aggregated at first holder PAN level.

## Key Points

- Fresh SIP registrations resumed from December 23, 2025
- Only monthly frequency SIPs permitted
- Maximum investment limit: ₹5,000 per investor (aggregated at first holder PAN level)
- Fresh lumpsum investments and switch-ins remain restricted
- Existing systematic transactions will continue to be processed without interruption
- No restrictions on redemptions, switch-outs, or STP-outs

## Regulatory Changes

This circular partially modifies the restrictions imposed on HDFC Defence Fund on July 08, 2024. The previous complete restriction on fresh SIP registrations has been relaxed to allow limited fresh SIP registrations under specific conditions.

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must take note of the resumed SIP registration facility
- Investment limits of ₹5,000 per investor at first holder PAN level must be enforced
- Only monthly frequency SIPs should be accepted for fresh registrations

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: December 22, 2025
- **Addendum Date**: December 19, 2025
- **Effective Date for Fresh SIP Registrations**: December 23, 2025
- **Reference to Previous Restriction**: July 08, 2024

## Impact Assessment

This circular provides partial relief to retail investors who wish to invest in HDFC Defence Fund through the systematic route. The ₹5,000 monthly limit makes the scheme accessible to small investors while maintaining control over fund inflows. The continued restriction on lumpsum investments indicates the fund manager's intention to manage asset size and liquidity. Existing investors continue to have full flexibility for redemptions and systematic outflows.
