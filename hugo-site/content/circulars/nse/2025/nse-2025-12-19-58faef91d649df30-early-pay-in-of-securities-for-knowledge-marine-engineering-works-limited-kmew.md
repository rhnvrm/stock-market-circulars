Members and custodians must follow specific procedures for early pay-in using old and new ISINs during the transition period.

## Key Points

- Face value split from Rs 10/- to Rs 5/- per share for KMEW
- Record Date and Ex-Date: December 22, 2025
- Old ISIN: INE0CJD01011
- Early pay-in on December 22, 2025 (Settlement 2025243) must use old/existing ISIN
- Early pay-in on December 23, 2025 (Settlements 2025243 & 2025244) transitions to new ISIN
- Adjusted quantity required: For sale of 10 shares, early pay-in should be 5 shares in old ISIN
- Block mechanism circular NCL/CMPT/53386 dated August 22, 2022 applies
- Client-wise allocation file should not be uploaded when using block mechanism
- Custodians using pool accounts must upload allocation details based on actual traded quantity

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular implements existing early pay-in procedures (Item 10.18 of consolidated circular NCL/CMPT/67751 dated April 29, 2025) for a specific corporate action event.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Members/Market Participants:**
- Execute early pay-in instructions in old ISIN (INE0CJD01011) for ex-date/record date December 22, 2025
- Adjust quantity proportionally (e.g., 5 shares in old ISIN for 10 shares sale)
- Comply with SEBI block mechanism requirements per NCL circular NCL/CMPT/53386 dated August 22, 2022
- Do not upload client-wise early pay-in allocation file when using block mechanism
- Execute pay-in/early pay-in in new ISIN after record date

**For Custodians:**
- If providing early pay-in through pool account, upload client-wise allocation details based on actual traded quantity (not adjusted quantity)
- Follow same ISIN transition process as members

## Important Dates

- **December 19, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **December 22, 2025**: Record date and ex-date for face value split; Settlement Number 2025243 (use old ISIN)
- **December 23, 2025**: Settlement Numbers 2025243 & 2025244 (use new ISIN)
- **Post-December 22, 2025**: All pay-in/early pay-in to be executed in new ISIN

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Members and custodians must carefully manage the ISIN transition during the two-day settlement period. Incorrect ISIN usage or quantity adjustment errors could result in settlement failures.

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium - Affects only KMEW stock holders and traders. The corporate action itself is routine, but the dual-ISIN early pay-in window requires operational attention.

**Compliance Impact:** Medium - Requires strict adherence to block mechanism rules and proper quantity calculations during the transition period. Custodians must ensure correct allocation reporting based on actual vs. adjusted quantities.
