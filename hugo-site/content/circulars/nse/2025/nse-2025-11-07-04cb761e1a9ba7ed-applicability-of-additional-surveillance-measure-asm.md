title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM)
---

## Summary

NSE has imposed Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) on two securities effective November 12, 2025. EPack Prefab Technologies Limited (moved from ST-ASM) and Onelife Capital Advisors Limited (moved from Encumbrance framework) will be placed under Stage-I of the LT-ASM framework with 100% margin requirements on all positions.

## Key Points

- Two securities shortlisted under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I effective November 10, 2025
- EPack Prefab Technologies Limited (EPACKPEB) - ISIN: INE0MLS01022 (moved from ST-ASM to LT-ASM)
- Onelife Capital Advisors Limited (ONELIFECAP) - ISIN: INE912L01015 (moved from Encumbrance to LT-ASM)
- 100% margin requirement applies on all open positions and new positions from November 12, 2025
- No securities moved to Stage-IV or between other stages in this circular
- ASM framework works in conjunction with other surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

The securities will be subject to Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure provisions:
- Margin rate increased to 100% for both existing open positions as on November 11, 2025 and new positions created from November 12, 2025 onwards
- Securities in Stage-IV would be shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ series) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE series), though no securities are in Stage-IV in this update

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must ensure 100% margin is collected on the specified securities
- Margin requirements apply to positions held on November 11, 2025 and all new positions from November 12, 2025
- Market participants must comply with ASM framework alongside other prevailing surveillance measures
- Price band restrictions remain applicable as per the surveillance framework

## Important Dates

- **November 07, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 10, 2025**: Securities formally shortlisted under LT-ASM Stage-I
- **November 11, 2025**: Last date before margin increase (positions as on this date subject to new margins)
- **November 12, 2025**: 100% margin requirement becomes effective

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Severe restriction on trading activity due to 100% margin requirement, effectively requiring full upfront payment for purchases and blocking full value for sales. This will significantly reduce speculative activity and leverage-based trading.

**Liquidity Impact**: Expected sharp decline in trading volumes and liquidity for EPACKPEB and ONELIFECAP as the high margin requirement deters most traders except those with strong conviction.

**Investor Impact**: Existing position holders must arrange for 100% margin by November 12, 2025 or face potential liquidation. New investors face higher capital requirements.

**Market Sentiment**: The surveillance action may negatively impact investor confidence in these securities, though NSE clarifies this is a surveillance measure and not adverse action against the companies.

**Reference Circulars**: This circular references NSE/SURV/39265 (Oct 27, 2018), NSE/SURV/45111 (Jul 22, 2020), NSE/SURV/46557 (Dec 04, 2020), NSE/SURV/48506 (Jun 04, 2021), NSE/SURV/52090 (Apr 22, 2022), NSE/SURV/63362 (Aug 09, 2024), and NSE/SURV/64066 (Sep 20, 2024).
