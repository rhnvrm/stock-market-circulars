**Market Impact:** High - All market participants with open F&O positions in KOTAKBANK must understand the adjustment mechanics to correctly assess their positions post-split.

**Operational Impact:** High - Trading members and clearing members must ensure their systems correctly reflect the 5x adjustment in contract quantities and proportional reduction in prices and strike prices.
