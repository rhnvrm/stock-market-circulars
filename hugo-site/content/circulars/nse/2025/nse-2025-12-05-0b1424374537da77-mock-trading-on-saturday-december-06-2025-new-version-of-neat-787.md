## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - All F&O trading members must upgrade to NEAT+ 7.8.7 and adapt to new pre-open session workflows. This requires system updates, testing participation, and potential changes to existing trading strategies and automated systems.

**Market Impact**: Medium - Introduction of pre-open session in F&O segment will change market microstructure, potentially improving price discovery and reducing volatility at market open. The pre-open session applies to December month futures contracts (FUTIDX & FUTSTK), affecting trading in index and stock futures.

**Technology Impact**: Members must ensure their trading systems, especially algorithmic trading systems, are compatible with the new NEAT+ version and pre-open session functionality. The requirement to test algorithmic trading safety features indicates enhanced regulatory oversight of automated trading activities.

**Compliance Impact**: Members must provide evidence of mock session participation, adding to compliance documentation requirements. The glide path for algorithmic trading retail investor safety features requires ongoing attention and implementation.
