- ISIN: INE726L20019
- Series: BE (Trade to Trade segment)
- Total REs: 5,217,109
- Market lot: 1

- REs give right to participate in ongoing Rights Issue or renounce before issue closes
- Unsubscribed and unrenounced REs will lapse and be extinguished after Issue Closing Date
- Trading members must inform clients and include disclaimer in contract notes

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This circular implements existing regulations under NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A (Regulations 3.1.1 and 2.5.5) for admission of Rights Entitlements to trading.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members must:**
  - Inform all clients about commencement of RE trading
  - Clearly mention the ISIN (INE726L20019) to avoid confusion with ordinary shares
  - Include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases
  - Disclaimer must inform clients that REs only provide right to participate in Rights Issue with requisite application money or renounce before issue closes
  - Warn clients that unsubscribed/unrenounced REs will lapse after Issue Closing Date

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 27, 2025
- **Trading Period for Renunciation:** October 27, 2025 to November 03, 2025
- **Suspension Date:** November 04, 2025
- **Issue Closing Date:** November 03, 2025 (implied - last day to subscribe or renounce)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Limited to shareholders and potential investors of DELPHI WORLD MONEY LIMITED. The Rights Entitlements trading provides liquidity and price discovery for rights during the renunciation period.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members handling DELPH shares must ensure proper client communication and contract note disclosures to prevent confusion between REs and ordinary shares. The Trade to Trade settlement and compulsory demat requirement necessitates immediate settlement and demat account holdings.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders receive tradable rights that can be sold during the 8-day trading window. Buyers of REs can participate in the Rights Issue. Critical risk: REs become worthless if not exercised or sold before November 03, 2025.
