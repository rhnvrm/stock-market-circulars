## Impact Assessment

This listing represents a significant capital raising exercise by Adani Enterprises Limited through rights issue mechanism. The partly paid-up nature indicates a staged payment structure where shareholders have paid 50% of the face value (Rs. 0.50 out of Re. 1) and Rs. 900 on application against the issue price of Rs. 1800. The large number of shares (138.5 million) indicates substantial participation in the rights issue. Trading will occur under a separate symbol (ADANIENPP) to distinguish these partly paid shares from fully paid equity shares. Investors should note the pari passu status, meaning these shares will rank equally with existing equity shares upon full payment. No lock-in restrictions apply, providing immediate liquidity to rights issue subscribers.
