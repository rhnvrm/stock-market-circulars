The new ISIN code INE00YB01025 will apply to all trades executed on or after the ex-date of October 17, 2025.

## Key Points

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 15, 2025
- **Effective Date (Ex-date)**: October 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10 times while reducing the face value from Rs. 10 to Re. 1. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Exchange members, brokers, and market infrastructure institutions need to update their systems to accommodate the new ISIN. Trading and settlement systems must be configured to handle the new security identifier.

**Shareholder Impact**: Medium - Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held. The total investment value remains unchanged, but the number of shares and per-share price will be adjusted proportionately.
