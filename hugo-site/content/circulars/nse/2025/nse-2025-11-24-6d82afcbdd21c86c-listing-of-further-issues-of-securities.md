## Important Dates

- **October 16, 2025**: Allotment date for Krishca Strapping Solutions Limited shares
- **October 22, 2025**: Allotment date for RNFI Services Limited shares
- **November 24, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **November 25, 2025**: Effective listing date for both securities on SME EMERGE platform
- **June 29, 2026**: Lock-in expiry for RNFI Services Limited
- **June 15, 2027**: Lock-in expiry for Krishca Strapping Solutions Limited

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal market-wide impact as this affects only SME segment securities with relatively small issuance sizes. The further issues represent capital raising activities through preferential allotment/warrant conversion routes.

**Company-Specific Impact**: 
- Krishca Strapping Solutions raised approximately Rs. 4.84 crore (207,654 shares × Rs. 233) through warrant conversion
- RNFI Services raised approximately Rs. 2.91 crore (107,963 shares × Rs. 270) through preferential allotment
- Increased float and liquidity for both companies on SME platform

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should note potential dilution from these further issues. Lock-in periods provide stability by restricting immediate sale by allottees. The pari passu nature ensures equal rights for new shareholders.
