## Summary

National Stock Exchange of India has announced a change in ISIN code for Computer Age Management Services Limited (CAMS) equity shares. The new ISIN INE596I01020 will become effective from December 05, 2025, replacing the existing ISIN due to stock sub-division from face value of Rs. 10/- to Rs. 2/- per share.

## Key Points

- New ISIN: INE596I01020
- Company: Computer Age Management Services Limited (Symbol: CAMS)
- Reason: Stock sub-division from Rs. 10/- to Rs. 2/- per share
- The new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on or after the ex-date
- All exchange members have been notified of this change

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action involving ISIN code modification to reflect stock sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Exchange members must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN code INE596I01020
- All trades executed on or from December 05, 2025 must use the new ISIN
- Trading and settlement systems need to be configured for the new face value of Rs. 2/- per share

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: November 28, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: December 05, 2025 (new ISIN becomes effective)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Stock sub-division will increase the number of shares outstanding while proportionally reducing the price per share, making shares more affordable to retail investors. This is a neutral corporate action from a valuation perspective.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members, custodians, and market infrastructure providers must update their systems to handle the new ISIN and revised face value. Existing shareholders will receive additional shares in the ratio corresponding to the 5:1 split (Rs. 10 to Rs. 2).
