  Capital Audit Report
---

## Summary

NSE has identified 5 companies that failed to submit reconciliation of share capital audit reports as required under Regulation 76 of SEBI Depositories and Participants Regulations, 2018 for two consecutive quarters (June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025). Trading in these securities will be shifted to Z Category (BZ series) with effect from January 2, 2026, unless compliance is achieved by December 30, 2025. Additionally, 17 companies already trading in Z Category remain non-compliant with the same regulation.

## Key Points

- 5 companies identified for potential shift to Z Category: Brightcom Group Limited, Debock Industries Limited, Future Consumer Limited, Rajesh Exports Limited, and Shrenik Limited
- Non-compliance relates to Regulation 76 (submission of reconciliation of share capital audit report) for Q2 and Q3 2025 (June 30 and September 30, 2025)
- Companies have until December 30, 2025 to comply and avoid Z Category transfer
- 17 companies already in Z Category also identified as non-compliant with same regulation
- All trades in Z Category securities settled on Trade for Trade (T2T) basis
- Action based on SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

**For Listed Companies:**
- Must submit reconciliation of share capital audit report as per Regulation 76 of SEBI Depository Regulations
- Companies currently identified (BCG, DIL, FCONSUMER, RAJESHEXPO, SHRENIK) must comply on or before December 30, 2025 to avoid Z Category transfer
- Failure to comply results in trading restrictions (Trade for Trade basis only)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- High impact on liquidity for affected securities due to Trade for Trade settlement mechanism
- Significant for Rajesh Exports Limited, a major listed entity in gems and jewelry sector
- Investors face reduced trading flexibility and potentially wider bid-ask spreads

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members must adjust systems for T2T settlement of these securities
- Margin requirements and settlement processes differ for Z Category securities
- Increased compliance monitoring required for brokers handling these securities

**Investor Impact:**
- Reduced liquidity makes entry and exit more difficult
- No intraday trading allowed (T2T basis only)
- Potential price discovery issues due to restricted trading
- 22 total companies affected (5 new + 17 already in Z Category)
