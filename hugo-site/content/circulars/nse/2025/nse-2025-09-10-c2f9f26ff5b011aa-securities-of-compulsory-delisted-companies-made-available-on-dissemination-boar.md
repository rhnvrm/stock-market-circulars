## Summary

NSE has announced that two compulsory delisted companies - Penta Gold Limited (PENTAGOLD) and S.S. Infrastructure Development Consultants Limited (SSINFRA) - will be moved to the Exchange's Dissemination Board (DB) effective September 16, 2025. These companies were previously delisted under SEBI Delisting Regulations 2021, and will now be available for buying and selling on the DB platform.

## Key Points

- Two companies to be moved to Dissemination Board: Penta Gold Limited and S.S. Infrastructure Development Consultants Limited
- Companies were compulsory delisted under SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulation 2021, Regulation 32(5)
- Movement follows SEBI directive dated June 6, 2016 (ref. CFD/DCR/OW/2016/16113)
- Continuation of previous circular NSE/CML/69182 dated July 18, 2025
- Trading will be available on Dissemination Board platform

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has directed NSE to move compulsory delisted companies to the Dissemination Board as per its letter dated June 6, 2016. This allows investors to trade securities of delisted companies in a separate segment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must note the change in trading platform for these securities
- Securities will be available for buying and selling exclusively on the Dissemination Board
- Normal trading rules and procedures will apply on the DB platform

## Important Dates

- **September 16, 2025**: Effective date for moving securities to Dissemination Board
- **July 18, 2025**: Previous related circular date
- **June 6, 2016**: Original SEBI directive date

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this affects only two previously delisted companies. The move provides a trading avenue for existing shareholders of these delisted securities. Trading volume and liquidity are expected to be minimal given the delisted status of these companies.
