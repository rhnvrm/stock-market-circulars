DHARAN INFRA-EPC LIMITED (Symbol: DHARAN, ISIN: INE278R01034) has been shortlisted under ASM-IBC framework based on receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company, effective December 23, 2025. This surveillance measure is implemented in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures.

- Addition based on "Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company" criteria
- No securities moved to Stage I or Stage II of ASM-IBC
- No securities excluded from ASM-IBC framework
- No securities moved between Stage I and Stage II
- ASM-IBC framework operates in conjunction with all other surveillance measures
- Price band adjustments apply when securities move out of the framework
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

This circular references previous circulars (NSE/SURV/37979 dated June 08, 2018, NSE/SURV/52368 dated May 20, 2022, NSE/SURV/55582 dated February 10, 2023, and NSE/SURV/70074 dated September 05, 2025) and implements the continuing ASM framework for companies under IBC proceedings.

- Trading in the shortlisted security will be subject to ASM-IBC provisions
- Members should monitor and comply with all applicable surveillance measures
- For queries, members may contact surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: December 22, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 23, 2025 - DHARAN added to ASM-IBC framework

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to one security (DHARAN). The addition to ASM-IBC framework indicates heightened surveillance due to IBC-related developments. Investors should exercise caution when trading this security.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to be aware of the ASM-IBC status when executing trades in DHARAN. The security will be subject to enhanced monitoring and may have modified price bands or trading restrictions as part of the surveillance framework.

**Price Band Impact**: Securities under ASM-IBC may have different price band restrictions. When a security exits the framework, the price band will revert to the applicable band before shortlisting, unless it is part of another surveillance measure.
