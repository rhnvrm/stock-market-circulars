**Operational Impact:** Medium - Members must adjust trading systems, risk management protocols, and settlement schedules. The distribution of holidays across the year requires advance planning for liquidity management and position rollovers, especially around expiry dates.

**Participant Impact:** Low to Medium - Retail and institutional participants should plan investment and hedging strategies considering these closures. The Muhurat Trading session provides a traditional trading opportunity during Diwali festivities.
