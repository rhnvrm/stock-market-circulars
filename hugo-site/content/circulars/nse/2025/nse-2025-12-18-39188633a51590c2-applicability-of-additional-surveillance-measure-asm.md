## Summary

NSE has issued Circular No. 978/2025 placing two securities under Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Stage I effective December 19, 2025. The securities are Lotus Eye Hospital and Institute Limited (LOTUSEYE) and Marinetrans India Limited (MARINETRAN). Marinetrans has been moved from Short-Term ASM to Long-Term ASM framework. A 100% margin requirement will be applicable on all open positions as on December 22, 2025 and new positions from December 23, 2025 onwards.

## Key Points

- Two securities placed under Long-Term ASM Stage I: LOTUSEYE (INE947I01017) and MARINETRAN (INE0P1P01017)
- Marinetrans India Limited moved from ST-ASM to LT-ASM framework
- 100% margin requirement applicable from December 23, 2025
- No securities moved to Stage IV (Trade-for-Trade segment)
- No securities transitioned between other stages (I to II, II to III, I to IV)
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Circular references previous circulars from October 2018 through September 2024

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure provisions for the listed securities. Securities qualifying under Criteria VII would be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE), though no securities met this criterion in this circular. The ASM framework is clarified as purely a market surveillance action and should not be construed as adverse action against the companies.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure 100% margin is collected on all open positions in LOTUSEYE and MARINETRAN as on December 22, 2025
- 100% margin must be collected on all new positions in these securities from December 23, 2025 onwards
- Members should refer to FAQs at https://www.nseindia.com/regulations/additional-surveillance-measure for detailed information
- Queries should be directed to surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **December 18, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **December 19, 2025**: Securities formally placed under LT-ASM Stage I
- **December 22, 2025**: Last trading day before margin changes
- **December 23, 2025**: 100% margin requirement becomes effective on all open positions and new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The 100% margin requirement will significantly reduce leverage and potentially impact liquidity in both securities. Traders holding positions will need to provide full margin by December 23, 2025.

**Investor Impact**: High margin requirements typically lead to reduced speculative activity and increased volatility. Long-term investors may see reduced liquidity.

**Market Significance**: Marinetrans India's escalation from ST-ASM to LT-ASM indicates persistent surveillance concerns. This progression suggests sustained unusual price movements or trading patterns that warrant enhanced monitoring.

**Liquidity Concerns**: The 100% margin requirement typically results in decreased trading volumes and wider bid-ask spreads, making it more difficult for investors to enter or exit positions.
