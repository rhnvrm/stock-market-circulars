The change applies to schemes launched prior to December 31, 2012. Plans for investors investing through distributors will be renamed as 'Regular Plan' and plans for investors investing directly will be renamed as 'Direct Plan', replacing the previous naming convention that included the full scheme name.

**Investor Impact**: No action required from existing or new investors. Unit holdings, NAV calculations, and all scheme features remain unchanged. The nomenclature change provides clearer differentiation between regular and direct investment routes.
