title: Non-Business Day for certain schemes of Mutual Fund on NSE MF Invest Platform
  for November 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has issued Circular No. 980/2025 dated November 10, 2025, notifying members about non-business days for certain mutual fund schemes on the NSE MF Invest Platform during November 2025. On these designated dates, all transactions including subscriptions, redemptions, switches, SIPs, STPs, and SWPs will not be permitted for the specified schemes.

## Key Points

- Three specific non-business days designated: November 11, 24, and 27, 2025
- Affects schemes from Bandhan Mutual Fund and Nippon India Mutual Fund
- All transaction types restricted: subscriptions, redemptions, switches, SIPs, STPs, and SWPs
- Restriction applies only to schemes listed in Annexure-I
- Notification based on communication received from the respective Mutual Funds

## Affected Schemes

**Bandhan Mutual Fund (November 11, 2025):**
- Bandhan US Treasury Bond 0-1 Year Fund of Fund - All plan variants (Regular and Direct, Growth and IDCW options)
- Total 6 ISINs: INF194KB1FT6, INF194KB1FU4, INF194KB1FZ3, INF194KB1FV2, INF194KB1FW0, INF194KB1GA4

**Nippon India Mutual Fund (November 24, 2025):**
- Nippon India Japan Equity Fund - All plan variants (Direct and Growth plans with various IDCW options)
- Total 8 ISINs affected

**Nippon India Mutual Fund (November 27, 2025):**
- Nippon India US Equity Opportunities - All plan variants (Direct and Regular, Growth and IDCW options)
- Total 6 ISINs affected

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must ensure no transactions are processed for the specified schemes on their respective non-business days
- Members should inform investors about the transaction restrictions on these dates
- Alternative transaction dates should be communicated to investors planning activities on non-business days

## Important Dates

- **November 11, 2025**: Non-business day for Bandhan US Treasury Bond 0-1 Year Fund of Fund schemes
- **November 24, 2025**: Non-business day for Nippon India Japan Equity Fund schemes
- **November 27, 2025**: Non-business day for Nippon India US Equity Opportunities schemes
- **Circular Date**: November 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact is moderate and limited in scope:

- **Investor Impact**: Investors in the specified international/overseas investment schemes will need to plan transactions around the non-business days. The restrictions align with holidays in the underlying international markets (U.S. Veterans Day on November 11, Japan Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 24, and U.S. Thanksgiving on November 27).

- **Operational Impact**: NSE MF Invest platform will block all transaction types for these specific schemes on designated dates, requiring system configuration updates.

- **Market Impact**: Minimal broader market impact as restrictions are limited to specific international fund schemes and pre-announced dates.

- **Scope**: Only affects investors in Bandhan US Treasury Bond Fund of Fund, Nippon India US Equity Opportunities, and Nippon India Japan Equity Fund - not the broader mutual fund universe on NSE platform.
