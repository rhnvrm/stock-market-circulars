## Impact Assessment

This mock trading session has medium operational impact on all NSE trading members. Members must ensure timely download and installation of NEAT+ version 7.8.6 to avoid trading disruptions. The mock session provides an opportunity to test the new version in a controlled environment before live deployment. The discontinuation of version 7.8.5 means members cannot continue using this version after November 22, 2025. No financial obligations arise from the mock trading session, and it serves purely for software testing and familiarization purposes.
