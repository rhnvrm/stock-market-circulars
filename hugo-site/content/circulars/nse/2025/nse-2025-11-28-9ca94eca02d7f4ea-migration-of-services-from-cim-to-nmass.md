title: Migration of Services from CIM to NMASS
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited is migrating collateral management services from the existing Collateral Interface for Members (CIM) to the NMASS platform. The CIM system will be discontinued effective December 15, 2025. Super admin users can begin creating or modifying roles from December 01, 2025. All clearing members and custodians must complete role assignments before the deadline to ensure uninterrupted access to collateral services.

## Key Points

- CIM (Collateral Interface for Members) will be discontinued on December 15, 2025
- All collateral management functionalities will be available on NMASS platform
- Super admin role assignment capabilities available from December 01, 2025
- No changes to existing processes, only platform migration
- Collateral Release services include: New Request/Inquiry, Data Export, File Upload, Download Return Files, and Instruction-wise File Upload
- EMI services cover Cash Deposit and G-sec Deposit
- Reports include Quantity Breach Report, Direct Pledge Securities Report, and Data Export
- Super admin users must create or modify roles to assign new services in NMASS
- User manual provided in annexure for NMASS functionalities

## Regulatory Changes

This is a platform consolidation initiative by NSE Clearing Limited to provide a single member interface. There are no regulatory or process changes - only the technology platform is changing from CIM to NMASS. The functionality and menus remain identical to those currently available.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Clearing Members/Custodians/PCM:**
- Super admin users must create or modify roles in NMASS before December 15, 2025
- Assign appropriate access rights for collateral management services to relevant users
- Review and implement role configurations between December 01-15, 2025
- Refer to the detailed user manual (Version 2.0, November 2025) provided in annexure
- Complete migration activities to avoid operational challenges

**Contact Support:**
- Telephone: 1800 266 0050 (option 2)
- Email: collaterals_ops@nsccl.co.in

## Important Dates

- **November 28, 2025**: Circular issued (Ref No: NCL/CMPT/71537, Circular 0155/2025)
- **December 01, 2025**: Super admin users can begin creating/modifying roles in NMASS
- **December 15, 2025**: CIM services discontinued; all services go live on NMASS

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** High - This is a mandatory system migration affecting all clearing members, custodians, and Professional Clearing Members (PCM). Failure to complete role configuration before December 15, 2025 will result in loss of access to critical collateral management functions including collateral release, EMI operations, and reporting capabilities.

**Affected Services:**
1. Collateral Release operations (requests, inquiries, file uploads/downloads)
2. Early Margin Income (EMI) - cash and G-sec deposits
3. Critical reports (quantity breach, direct pledge securities)

**Business Continuity:** Members have a 14-day window (December 01-15) to complete the transition. The tight timeline requires immediate action planning to prevent service disruptions in collateral operations which are essential for daily clearing activities.

**Technical Requirements:** Super admin users need to familiarize themselves with NMASS role management and the new interface using the provided user manual to ensure smooth transition.
