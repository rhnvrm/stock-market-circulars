**Trading Impact**: Minimal - All securities have standard market lot of 1 and are pari passu with existing shares. No special trading arrangements required.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in outstanding shares for each company, but volumes are relatively small compared to typical free float.

**Investor Impact**: No direct impact on existing shareholders beyond normal dilution from ESOP and preferential allotments already disclosed by companies.
