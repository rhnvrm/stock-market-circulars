title: Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) Framework Updates - October 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has issued updates to the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) Framework effective October 07, 2025. Two securities have been added to Long-Term ASM Stage I, with SIKKO Industries Limited moving from ST-ASM to LT-ASM framework. AXISCADES Technologies Limited is being moved directly from Stage I to Stage IV, requiring it to shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ) to Trade-for-Trade (BE) on a T+3 basis within 3 days of circular issuance.

## Key Points

- Two securities added to Long-Term ASM Framework Stage I: SIKKO Industries Limited (INE112X01017) and Sumeet Industries Limited (INE235C01036)
- SIKKO Industries Limited moved from Short-Term ASM to Long-Term ASM framework
- AXISCADES Technologies Limited (INE555B01013) moved from Stage I to Stage IV under Criteria VII
- AXISCADES will shift from Rolling Settlement (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade (Series: BE) on T+3 basis
- No securities excluded from ASM framework in this update
- No movements between other stage transitions (Stage I to II, II to III, etc.)
- Consolidated ASM list includes multiple securities across different stages

## Regulatory Changes

The Long-Term ASM Framework applies enhanced surveillance on securities based on various criteria including price movements, volume patterns, and corporate actions. Stage IV placement under Criteria VII triggers the most stringent measure - mandatory Trade-for-Trade settlement, eliminating intraday trading and requiring full upfront delivery.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with Trade-for-Trade settlement requirements for AXISCADES from T+3 day
- Position limits and margin requirements as applicable under ASM framework must be observed
- Enhanced surveillance and monitoring of securities under ASM framework
- Clients trading in ASM securities must be informed of applicable restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 07, 2025 - ASM framework changes take effect
- **T+3 Implementation**: AXISCADES shift to Trade-for-Trade segment (3 trading days from circular date)
- **Circular Date**: October 06, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on AXISCADES**: The direct movement to Stage IV with Trade-for-Trade requirement significantly restricts liquidity, eliminates intraday trading, and requires 100% upfront margins from both buyers and sellers. This typically results in reduced trading volumes and increased price volatility.

**Medium Impact on SIKKO and SUMEETINDS**: Stage I placement involves enhanced surveillance but allows normal trading, though it signals regulatory concern and may deter some investors.

**Market Implications**: ASM framework is designed to protect investors from excessive speculation and unusual price movements. Securities under ASM typically experience reduced institutional participation and higher bid-ask spreads due to trading restrictions.
