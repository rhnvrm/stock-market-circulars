## Summary

NSE has issued surveillance measures under the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework affecting specific securities. Maxvolt Energy Industries Limited is being included in ESM Stage-I, while Kandarp Digi Smart BPO Limited is being moved from Stage-I to Stage-II. These changes impose stricter trading conditions including minimum 100% margin requirements and trade-for-trade settlement effective November 13, 2025.

## Key Points

- Maxvolt Energy Industries Limited (INE10A501018) newly included in ESM Stage-I
- Kandarp Digi Smart BPO Limited (INE0MOT01016) moving from ESM Stage-I to Stage-II
- Securities in ESM Stage-I will attract minimum 100% margin on all positions
- No securities are being excluded from the ESM framework at this time
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

**ESM Stage-I Securities:**
- Shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST)
- Minimum 100% margin applied on all open positions as of November 12, 2025, and new positions from November 13, 2025

**ESM Stage-II Securities:**
- Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- Additional restrictions beyond Stage-I measures

## Compliance Requirements

**For NSE Members:**
- Ensure minimum 100% margin is collected for securities listed in Annexure I
- Apply margin requirements to both existing open positions (as of November 12, 2025) and new positions created from November 13, 2025
- Transition affected securities from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment
- Implement periodic call auction with 2% price band for Stage-II securities
- Review consolidated list in Annexure III for all securities currently under ESM framework

**For Investors:**
- Higher margin requirements will apply for trading in affected securities
- Only delivery-based trading permitted (Trade-for-Trade)
- Stage-II securities subject to periodic call auction with limited price movement

## Important Dates

- **November 11, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 12, 2025**: ESM measures become applicable; Stage-II securities move to periodic call auction with 2% price band
- **November 13, 2025**: 100% margin effective on new positions; securities shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST segment

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Reduced liquidity in affected securities due to Trade-for-Trade requirement
- Higher capital requirements for traders due to 100% margin mandate
- Limited intraday trading opportunities as positions must be settled by delivery
- Price discovery constraints for Stage-II securities due to 2% price band in periodic call auction

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members must update risk management systems to enforce 100% margin
- Brokers need to communicate restrictions to clients holding or trading these securities
- Settlement processes shift from net settlement to gross delivery-based settlement

**Investor Impact:**
- Increased capital commitment required for trading positions
- Reduced flexibility for short-term trading strategies
- Potential difficulty in exiting positions due to reduced liquidity
- Stage-II securities face additional constraints with periodic call auction mechanism
