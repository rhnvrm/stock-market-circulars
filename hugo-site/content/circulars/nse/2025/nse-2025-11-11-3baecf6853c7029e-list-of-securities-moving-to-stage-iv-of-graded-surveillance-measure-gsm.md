---

## Summary

The NSE has announced that four securities will be moved to Stage IV of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective November 12, 2025. Stage IV represents the most stringent surveillance level with severe trading restrictions including trade-for-trade settlement, trading permitted only once per week (Mondays/first trading day), 5% or lower price band, 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) by buyers, and critically, no upward price movement allowed.

## Key Points

- Four securities moving to Stage IV GSM: Blue Chip India Limited (BLUECHIP), Gayatri Projects Limited (GAYAPROJ), Grand Foundry Limited (GFSTEELS), and Univa Foods Limited (UNIVAFOODS)
- Trading restrictions include trade-for-trade basis with no netting off allowed
- Price band limited to 5% or lower as applicable
- Trading permitted only once per week (every Monday or first trading day of the week)
- 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) of trade value required from buyers
- No upward price movement permitted
- Settlement on trade-to-trade basis only

## Regulatory Changes

The affected securities are being escalated to Stage IV of the GSM framework, which is continuation of NSE's progressive surveillance mechanism. This follows previous circulars dating back to February 2017 establishing the GSM framework. Stage IV is the highest and most restrictive surveillance stage, indicating serious concerns about these securities.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Take adequate precautions while trading in these securities
- Ensure buyers deposit 100% ASD of trade value
- Follow trade-for-trade settlement with no netting off
- Restrict trading to designated weekly trading day only
- Enforce price band limitations of 5% or lower
- Ensure no upward price movement in these securities

**Affected Securities and ISINs:**
1. BLUE CHIP INDIA LIMITED (BLUECHIP) - INE657B01025
2. GAYATRI PROJECTS LIMITED (GAYAPROJ) - INE336H01023
3. GRAND FOUNDRY LIMITED (GFSTEELS) - INE534A01028
4. UNIVA FOODS LIMITED (UNIVAFOODS) - INE275F01019

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** November 11, 2025
- **Effective Date:** November 12, 2025
- **Trading Days:** Every Monday or first trading day of the week only

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Severe liquidity constraints for these four securities
- Trading frequency reduced to once per week only
- Complete prohibition on upward price movement eliminates any potential for price appreciation
- 100% ASD requirement significantly increases capital requirements for buyers

**Investor Impact:**
- Existing shareholders face extremely limited exit opportunities (weekly trading only)
- No possibility of price recovery due to prohibition on upward movement
- High capital requirements (100% ASD) will deter new buyers
- Trade-for-trade settlement eliminates position netting benefits

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers must implement strict controls for these securities
- Enhanced surveillance and monitoring required
- Settlement processes must ensure trade-to-trade basis

**GSM Framework Context:**
Stage IV represents the final and most severe surveillance action before potential suspension, indicating NSE has serious concerns about price manipulation, volatility, or other market integrity issues with these securities. The prohibition on upward price movement is unique to Stage IV and represents the most extreme trading restriction in the GSM framework.
