## Summary

NSE will conduct a mock trading session on Saturday, November 29, 2025. During this session, the Unique Client Code (UCC) live environment will be unavailable from 10 AM to 10 PM. Members are advised to refrain from making any UCC modifications or uploads during this period as such changes will not be considered valid for live trading sessions starting December 1, 2025, and will be purged from the system.

## Key Points

- Mock trading session scheduled for Saturday, November 29, 2025
- UCC live environment unavailable from 10 AM to 10 PM on November 29, 2025
- Any UCC records added or modified during the blackout period will be purged by end of day
- Modified/uploaded UCCs during this period will not be valid for live trading from December 1, 2025 onwards
- Members must avoid all UCC modifications and uploads during the specified timeframe

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a temporary operational measure for the mock trading session.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must refrain from making any UCC modifications or uploads between 10 AM and 10 PM on November 29, 2025
- Members should plan UCC updates before 10 AM on November 29 or after 10 PM on November 29 to ensure validity for live trading
- All UCC changes needed for December 1, 2025 trading onwards must be completed outside the blackout window

## Important Dates

- **November 28, 2025**: Circular issued, related circulars NSE/CMTR/71532 and NSE/FAOP/71527 also issued
- **November 29, 2025**: Mock trading session conducted; UCC system unavailable 10 AM - 10 PM
- **December 1, 2025**: Live trading resumes on Monday

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium. Members need to plan their UCC management activities around the 12-hour blackout period. Any urgent client onboarding or UCC modifications required for Monday trading must be completed before the mock session begins or after it ends.

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a scheduled maintenance activity for system testing purposes. Normal trading is not affected as the mock session occurs on Saturday when markets are closed.

**Member Impact**: Members must coordinate internal operations to avoid UCC changes during the specified period. Failure to comply may result in invalid client codes and inability to process trades for affected clients on December 1, 2025.
