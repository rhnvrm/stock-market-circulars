- Shareholders will receive additional shares in proportion to their existing holdings

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date:** November 26, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The face value split will increase the number of outstanding shares proportionally while reducing the price per share. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors. The total market capitalization and shareholder value remains unchanged.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers, custodians, and depository participants need to update their systems before the effective date. Shareholders will see their shareholding quantity double while the per-share price halves, maintaining overall investment value.
