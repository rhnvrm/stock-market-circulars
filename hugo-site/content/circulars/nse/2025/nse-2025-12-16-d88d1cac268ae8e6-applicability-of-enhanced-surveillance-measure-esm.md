## Summary

NSE has issued surveillance measures under the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework affecting 4 securities. Three securities (GICL, TRANSWIND, TVVISION) are being included in ESM Stage-I with minimum 100% margin requirement. One security (PROZONER) is being escalated from Stage-I to Stage-II with additional restrictions including 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction. All Stage-I securities will shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM series) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST series).

## Key Points

- 3 securities added to ESM Stage-I: Globe International Carriers Limited (GICL), Transwind Infrastructures Limited (TRANSWIND), TV Vision Limited (TVVISION)
- 1 security escalated from Stage-I to Stage-II: Prozone Realty Limited (PROZONER)
- No securities excluded from ESM framework
- No securities moved from Stage-II back to Stage-I
- 100% minimum margin applies to all open positions and new positions
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not adverse action against companies

**Trading Impact:**

- Increased transaction costs due to compulsory delivery-based settlement

**Investor Impact:**
- Existing position holders must arrange 100% margin by December 17, 2025
- Reduced ability to exit positions quickly due to Trade-for-Trade restrictions
- Higher capital requirements for maintaining or creating positions

**Market Surveillance:**
- Exchange emphasizes this is surveillance-driven, not punitive action against companies
- Measures aim to curb excessive speculation and price manipulation
- Framework operates alongside other existing surveillance measures
