## Summary

NSE has conducted a periodic review of securities under the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework in coordination with other exchanges. Based on this assessment, 8 securities have been identified as eligible to move to lower stages of GSM surveillance effective November 10, 2025. This includes 2 securities moving from Stage I to Stage 0 (complete removal from GSM), 1 security moving from Stage II to Stage I, 1 security moving from Stage III to Stage II, and 4 securities moving from Stage IV to Stage III. INFOMEDIA PRESS LIMITED will also see its series changed from BE to EQ as part of the relaxation.

## Key Points

- 1 security (SUPREMEENG) moving from Stage III to Stage II
- 4 securities (BLUECHIP, GAYAPROJ, GFSTEELS, UNIVAFOODS) moving from Stage IV to Stage III
- Review conducted in coordination with other stock exchanges
- Circular references previous GSM framework circulars from 2017, 2019, 2023, and 2024

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements the existing periodic review mechanism under the GSM framework originally introduced in February 2017 and subsequently updated. The relaxation represents a routine assessment of securities' compliance and risk profiles under the established framework.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements for members. The relaxation of surveillance stages reduces restrictions on the affected securities. Trading members should note:

- Updated GSM classification for the 8 securities from November 10, 2025

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** November 07, 2025
- **Effective Date:** November 10, 2025 - GSM stage relaxation becomes effective for all 8 securities

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact for Affected Securities:** The relaxation to lower GSM stages indicates improved market quality parameters and reduced surveillance concerns. Securities moving to lower stages will face fewer trading restrictions, potentially improving liquidity and investor confidence.

**Stage-wise Impact:**
- **Stage I to 0 (Exit from GSM):** LCCINFOTEC and NOIDATOLL will no longer be subject to any GSM restrictions, representing full normalization of trading conditions
- **Stage II to I:** INFOMEDIA will face reduced restrictions and benefits from series upgrade to EQ from BE
- **Stage III to II:** SUPREMEENG will see relaxed surveillance measures
- **Stage IV to III:** BLUECHIP, GAYAPROJ, GFSTEELS, and UNIVAFOODS move one stage closer to normal trading conditions

**Market Operational Impact:** Minimal disruption expected as this is a routine periodic review process. The relaxation is implemented systematically across exchanges to ensure uniform treatment.
