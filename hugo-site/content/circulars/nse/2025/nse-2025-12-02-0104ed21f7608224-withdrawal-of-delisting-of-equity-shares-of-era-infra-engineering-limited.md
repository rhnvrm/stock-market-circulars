## Impact Assessment

The impact is company-specific and limited to Era Infra Engineering Limited. The status change from delisted to suspended suggests potential regulatory or corporate developments that may lead to possible relisting or resolution of issues that caused the original delisting. For investors and stakeholders of ERAINFRA, this represents a change in the company's regulatory standing, though trading remains halted under suspended status. The broader market impact is minimal as this affects only one company.
