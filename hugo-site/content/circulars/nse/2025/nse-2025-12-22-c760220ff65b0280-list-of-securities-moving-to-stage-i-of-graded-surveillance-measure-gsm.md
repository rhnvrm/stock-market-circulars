title: Sadbhav Engineering Limited Moved to Stage I of Graded Surveillance Measure
  (GSM)
---

## Summary

NSE has moved Sadbhav Engineering Limited (Symbol: SADBHAV, ISIN: INE226H01026) to Stage I of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective December 23, 2025. This action imposes stricter trading conditions including 100% applicable margin rate and a price band restriction of 5% or lower.

## Key Points

- Sadbhav Engineering Limited is the only security being moved to GSM Stage I in this circular
- Trading restrictions become effective from December 23, 2025
- 100% margin requirement will apply to all trades
- Price band restricted to 5% or lower
- Members advised to take adequate precaution while trading in this security
- Circular references previous GSM framework circulars from 2017-2025

## Regulatory Changes

The security moves from normal trading to Stage I of the four-stage GSM framework. Stage I is the first level of enhanced surveillance and includes:

- Applicable margin rate of 100%
- Price band restriction of 5% or lower

Higher stages (II-IV) involve progressively stricter measures including Trade for Trade settlement, Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD), weekly trading restrictions, and no upward movement restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must ensure 100% margin is collected for trades in SADBHAV
- **Trading Members**: Must enforce the 5% or lower price band restriction
- **All Members**: Should exercise adequate precaution when trading this security
- **Buyers**: Must be prepared to meet higher margin requirements

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: December 22, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 23, 2025 - GSM Stage I measures come into force

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The 100% margin requirement will significantly increase the capital required to trade SADBHAV, likely reducing trading volumes and liquidity. The 5% price band will limit intraday price volatility.

**Market Participants**: Retail and institutional traders will face higher costs and capital requirements. Existing position holders may face margin calls.

**Security Outlook**: Movement to GSM Stage I indicates NSE has identified concerns warranting enhanced surveillance. This typically relates to volatility, price manipulation concerns, or other market integrity issues. Further deterioration could lead to progression to Stages II, III, or IV with increasingly restrictive measures including Trade for Trade settlement, weekly trading limits, and Additional Surveillance Deposits up to 100% of trade value.
