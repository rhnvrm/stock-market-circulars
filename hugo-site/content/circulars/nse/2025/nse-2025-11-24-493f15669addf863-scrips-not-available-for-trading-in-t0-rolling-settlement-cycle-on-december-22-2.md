## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Moderate impact on intraday traders who utilize T+0 settlement for these specific securities. The restriction is limited to two dates and affects 8 securities.

**Market Segments:** Banking sector stocks (INDUSINDBK, AUBANK, CANBK, PNB, UNIONBANK) are prominently represented, along with aviation (INDIGO), healthcare (MAXHEALTH), and automotive (TMPV) sectors.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to ensure their systems reflect these restrictions and communicate to clients who actively trade these securities on an intraday basis with T+0 settlement.

**Mitigation:** Traders can still trade these securities under the regular T+1 settlement cycle on these dates.
