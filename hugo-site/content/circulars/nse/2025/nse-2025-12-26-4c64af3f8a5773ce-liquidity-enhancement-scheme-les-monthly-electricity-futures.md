## Summary

NSE has extended the Liquidity Enhancement Scheme (LES) for Monthly Electricity Futures Contracts for an additional 6 months. The scheme, which was previously introduced through multiple circulars in June-July 2025, will now remain in effect until July 13, 2026. All existing provisions from the referenced circulars continue to apply without modification.

## Key Points

- LES on Monthly Electricity Futures extended for 6 months
- New expiry date: July 13, 2026
- All previous provisions remain unchanged
- NSE reserves right to amend or discontinue with 15 days advance notice
- References previous circulars: NSE/COM/68807 (June 27, 2025), NSE/COM/68867 (July 01, 2025), NSE/COM/68885 (July 02, 2025), NSE/COM/68968 and NSE/COM/68969 (July 04, 2025), NSE/COM/69072 (July 10, 2025)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular only extends the duration of the existing Liquidity Enhancement Scheme without modifying its terms or conditions.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. Members participating in the LES for Monthly Electricity Futures should continue following the provisions outlined in the previously referenced circulars.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** December 26, 2025
- **Scheme Extension Until:** July 13, 2026
- **Minimum Amendment Notice Period:** 15 days (if NSE decides to modify or discontinue)
