## Summary

NSE has updated the list of securities under the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Framework effective December 31, 2025. Five securities have been shortlisted in ST-ASM Stage-I, while four securities are being excluded from the ASM Framework entirely. The consolidated ASM list now contains 31 securities across different stages.

## Key Points

- 5 securities added to Short-Term ASM Framework Stage-I: Cubex Tubings Limited, Dynamic Services & Security Limited, Hindustan Copper Limited, Matrix Geo Solutions Limited, and MMTC Limited
- No securities in ST-ASM Stage-II currently
- No securities moving between Stage-I and Stage-II
- 4 securities excluded from ASM Framework: Amiable Logistics (India) Limited, DJ Mediaprint & Logistics Limited, Jayesh Logistics Limited, and Walchandnagar Industries Limited
- Consolidated ASM list contains 31 securities total (30 in Stage-I, 1 in Stage-II)

## Regulatory Changes

The Short-Term ASM Framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities showing unusual price movements or volatility patterns. Securities in this framework face additional trading restrictions and monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

Market participants trading in the affected securities must comply with ST-ASM framework requirements, which may include:
- Price bands or circuit limits
- Additional margin requirements
- Enhanced reporting obligations
- Trading restrictions as applicable to the surveillance stage

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 31, 2025 - New ST-ASM classifications and exclusions become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Securities Added to ST-ASM Stage-I (5 securities):**
1. CUBEXTUB - Cubex Tubings Limited (INE144D01012)
2. DYNAMIC - Dynamic Services & Security Limited (INE0DZ701010)
3. HINDCOPPER - Hindustan Copper Limited (INE531E01026)
4. MGSL - Matrix Geo Solutions Limited (INE132901013)
5. MMTC - MMTC Limited (INE123F01029)

**Securities Excluded from ASM (4 securities):**
1. AMIABLE - Amiable Logistics (India) Limited (INE0MTP01013)
2. DJML - DJ Mediaprint & Logistics Limited (INE0B1K01014)
3. JAYESH - Jayesh Logistics Limited (INE1AE401014)
4. WALCHANNAG - Walchandnagar Industries Limited (INE711A01022)

The addition of securities to ST-ASM indicates recent unusual price/volume behavior requiring enhanced surveillance. The exclusion of 4 securities suggests normalization of trading patterns. Investors in the newly added securities should expect stricter trading conditions and potentially higher transaction costs due to surveillance measures.
