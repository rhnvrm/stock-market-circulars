title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - Enfuse Solutions Limited
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a surveillance circular placing Enfuse Solutions Limited (Symbol: ENFUSE, ISIN: INE0S3X01014) under the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework Stage-I effective November 26, 2025. The security was previously under Short-Term ASM and has now been moved to the stricter Long-Term framework. A 100% margin requirement will be applicable on all positions from November 28, 2025.

## Key Points

- Enfuse Solutions Limited placed under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- Security moved from ST-ASM to LT-ASM framework
- 100% margin requirement applicable on all open and new positions
- No securities moved to Stage-IV (Trade-for-Trade segment) in this circular
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance, not adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

The Long-Term ASM Framework imposes stricter surveillance on securities that satisfy specific criteria over an extended period. This circular updates the list of securities under various stages of LT-ASM:

- **Stage-I**: Enfuse Solutions Limited (new entry, moved from ST-ASM)
- **Stage-II**: No new entries or movements
- **Stage-III**: No new entries or movements  
- **Stage-IV**: No new entries or movements

Securities in Stage-IV would be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE), but no securities qualified under this category in the current circular.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Ensure 100% margin collection on ENFUSE positions
- Apply margin requirements to all open positions as on November 27, 2025
- Apply margin requirements to all new positions created from November 28, 2025 onwards
- Maintain compliance with ASM framework alongside other prevailing surveillance measures

**For Market Participants:**
- Adjust trading strategies considering the enhanced margin requirements
- Note that ASM placement does not reflect adversely on the company's fundamentals

## Important Dates

- **November 25, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **November 26, 2025**: Effective date for LT-ASM Stage-I placement
- **November 27, 2025**: Last day with existing margin requirements
- **November 28, 2025**: 100% margin requirement becomes applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Significantly reduced liquidity in ENFUSE due to 100% margin requirement
- Higher capital requirements for traders holding positions in the security
- Potential increase in volatility as market adjusts to new margin regime
- Deterrent effect on speculative trading activity

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers must ensure adequate margin collection systems
- Risk management systems need adjustment for enhanced margin requirements
- Potential impact on client funding requirements and position sizes

**Investor Impact:**
- Retail investors may face difficulty maintaining positions due to high margin
- Institutional investors need to reassess position limits and capital allocation
- Movement from ST-ASM to LT-ASM indicates persistent surveillance concerns requiring investor attention
