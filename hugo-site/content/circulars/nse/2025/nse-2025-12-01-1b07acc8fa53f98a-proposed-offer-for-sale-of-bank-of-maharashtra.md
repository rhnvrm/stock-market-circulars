## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This is a substantial OFS involving a public sector bank with a potential offering of over 46 crore shares (including oversubscription option). The large offer size could impact Bank of Maharashtra's stock liquidity and price discovery during the bidding period.

**Trading Member Impact**: All Capital Market segment trading members need immediate action to ensure platform readiness, admin user access, and UCC compliance for themselves and their clients. Non-compliance will result in inability to participate in the OFS.

**Investor Impact**: The OFS provides investment opportunity across three categories with differentiated limits - retail investors can bid up to Rs 2 lakhs, employees up to Rs 5 lakhs, and non-retail/institutional investors have no upper limit. The relatively low floor price of Rs. 54 makes it accessible to retail participation.

**Operational Impact**: The strict UCC compliance timeline and one-day-prior requirement necessitates immediate action from brokers to verify and update client UCCs. The non-reversible nature of admin user requests and order rejection rules requires careful preparation.

**Helpdesk Support**: Members can contact toll-free number 1800 266 00 50 (Option 1) or email msm@nse.co.in for platform-related queries.
