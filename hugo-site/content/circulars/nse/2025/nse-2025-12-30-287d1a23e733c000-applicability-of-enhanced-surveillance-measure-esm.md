title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Two Securities Added to Stage I
---

## Summary

NSE has included two securities under Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Stage I effective January 1, 2026. The affected securities are Axita Cotton Limited (AXITA) and Rockingdeals Circular Economy Limited (ROCKINGDCE). These securities will attract a minimum 100% margin on all open positions as of December 31, 2025, and new positions from January 1, 2026. Additionally, they will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (EQ/SM series) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST series).

## Key Points

- Two securities added to ESM Stage I: AXITA (INE02EZ01022) and ROCKINGDCE (INE0PTR01012)
- 100% minimum margin requirement applicable on all positions
- Securities shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade (BE/ST) segment
- No securities moving between Stage I and Stage II
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Action is purely for market surveillance and not adverse against companies

## Regulatory Changes

Securities qualifying under ESM will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST) effective January 1, 2026. Securities moving to Stage II will be under Trade-for-Trade with a 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction effective December 31, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must ensure 100% margin collection on all open positions in affected securities as on December 31, 2025
- 100% margin must be collected on all new positions created from January 1, 2026
- Trading in affected securities will be restricted to Trade-for-Trade settlement only
- Market participants must comply with ESM framework alongside all other prevailing surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **December 31, 2025**: Securities moving to Stage II come under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- **December 31, 2025**: 100% margin applicable on all open positions in newly added ESM securities
- **January 1, 2026**: Effective date for 100% margin on new positions
- **January 1, 2026**: Securities shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST segment

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The 100% margin requirement will significantly reduce leverage and liquidity in the two affected securities. The shift to Trade-for-Trade settlement eliminates intraday trading and may substantially reduce trading volumes.

**Operational Impact**: High - Brokers and traders with existing positions in AXITA and ROCKINGDCE must arrange for 100% margin by December 31, 2025. The segment change requires system adjustments and may impact existing trading strategies.

**Investor Impact**: High - Investors holding these securities will face increased capital requirements and reduced liquidity. The trade-for-trade mechanism means mandatory delivery, eliminating speculative trading opportunities.
