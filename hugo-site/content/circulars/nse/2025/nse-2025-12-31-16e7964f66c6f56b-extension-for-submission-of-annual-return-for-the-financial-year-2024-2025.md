- Applies to financial year ended March 31, 2025
- Non-compliance will result in actions as per previous NCL circulars
- All other requirements of MCA General Circular No. 06/2025 remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued General Circular No. 08/2025 on December 30, 2025, as a continuation of General Circular No. 06/2025 dated October 17, 2025. This regulatory update provides:

2. Ensure compliance with net worth requirements as applicable
3. File appropriate e-Forms as required under the Companies Act, 2013

- NCL Circular Ref No. NCL/CMPL/67927 dated May 8, 2025

- **January 31, 2026**: Extended deadline for Annual Return submission without additional fees

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Provides relief to clearing members facing operational challenges in meeting year-end compliance deadlines
- Reduces financial burden by waiving additional fees for late submissions
- Maintains market integrity by ensuring all members complete mandatory filings

**Operational Impact:**
- Clearing members gain additional 31 days to complete annual compliance requirements
- Reduces pressure on internal compliance and finance teams during year-end period
- Allows time for proper audit completion and documentation preparation

**Compliance Impact:**
- Members must still prioritize completion of annual returns to avoid regulatory actions
- Extension does not modify underlying net worth or financial requirements
- Previous circular requirements regarding member obligations remain in full effect

**Risk Considerations:**
- Members should not delay filings as no further extensions are indicated
- Non-compliance beyond January 31, 2026 will result in strict regulatory actions
- Net worth shortfalls will trigger membership restrictions regardless of filing status
