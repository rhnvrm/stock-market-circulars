## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The number of shares being listed represents routine ESOP allotments that are typically small relative to the total outstanding shares of each company. The largest allotment is HDFC Life with 759,628 shares, which is negligible compared to its total share capital.

**Operational Impact:** No operational changes for trading members. Standard trading procedures apply with market lot size of 1 share.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders will see minor dilution from these ESOP allotments. All new shares carry equal rights (pari passu) with existing shares.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible increase in available float for trading purposes.
