title: Migration of Services from CIM to NMASS
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited is migrating collateral management services from the Collateral Interface for Members (CIM) to NMASS (NSE Member Account and Services System) as part of consolidating member interfaces. The CIM platform will be discontinued effective December 15, 2025. All clearing members and custodians must configure user roles in NMASS before this date to maintain access to collateral release, EMI deposits, and reporting functionalities.

## Key Points

- CIM platform will be completely discontinued on December 15, 2025
- All collateral management services migrating to NMASS platform
- No changes to existing processes or functionalities, only platform change
- Super Admin users must create or modify roles in NMASS for access
- Role creation/modification available from December 01, 2025
- Services include Collateral Release (request/inquiry, data export, file upload, download return files, instruction-wise file upload), EMI (cash deposit, G-sec deposit), and Reports (quantity breach, direct pledge securities, data export)
- User manual provided in annexure for NMASS functionalities

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a technology platform migration initiative by NSE Clearing to provide a single unified member interface. The functionality and processes remain unchanged from CIM to NMASS.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Clearing Members and Custodians:**
- Super Admin users must create or modify user roles in NMASS between December 01-15, 2025
- Assign appropriate rights for collateral release, EMI deposits, and reporting services
- Complete migration setup before December 15, 2025 to avoid operational disruptions
- Review user manual (Annexure) for NMASS collateral management module
- Ensure all users requiring access have proper role assignments in NMASS

**Contact for Support:**
- Telephone: 1800 266 0050 (option 2)
- Email: collaterals_ops@nsccl.co.in

## Important Dates

- **November 28, 2025**: Circular issued
- **December 01, 2025**: Role creation/modification becomes available in NMASS for Super Admin users
- **December 15, 2025**: CIM platform discontinued; all services live on NMASS (effective date)
- **Before December 15, 2025**: Deadline for members to complete role configuration

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** High - All clearing members and custodians must transition to new platform within tight timeline (approximately 2 weeks from role creation availability). Failure to configure roles will result in loss of access to critical collateral management functions including collateral release requests, EMI deposits, and various operational reports.

**Business Continuity Risk:** Members who fail to complete migration by December 15 will face operational challenges in managing collateral, processing deposits, and accessing essential reports. This could impact margin requirements and trading operations.

**Positive Long-term Impact:** Consolidation to single platform (NMASS) simplifies member access and reduces complexity of managing multiple interfaces. Processes remain unchanged, minimizing learning curve.

**Action Required:** Immediate attention from Super Admin users at member firms to plan role configuration and user access setup during the transition window.
