## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - All trading members must upgrade their systems to the new NEAT+ version. The mock session allows members to test the new software version before mandatory implementation. Members need to allocate resources for software installation, testing, and participation in the mock trading session.

**Technical Impact**: The release includes testing of both Primary Site and DR Site operations, including switchover scenarios. The discontinuation of NEAT+ 7.8.4 from December 06, 2025 creates a deadline for all members to complete the upgrade.

**Financial Impact**: None - No financial obligations arise from mock trading sessions; no fund pay-in or pay-out will occur for trades executed during the mock session.
