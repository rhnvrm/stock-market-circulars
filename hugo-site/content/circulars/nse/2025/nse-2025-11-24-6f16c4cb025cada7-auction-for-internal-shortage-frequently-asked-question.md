## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued a comprehensive FAQ document addressing common questions regarding auction procedures for internal shortages. This circular (Ref: 375/2025, NCL/CMPT/71441) follows the earlier circular NCL/CMPT/71045 dated October 30, 2025. The document clarifies key aspects of auction mechanisms including auction rates, close-out rates, auction differences, penalty applicability, and report availability for both CC-level and internal shortages.

## Key Points

- Auctions are conducted for both CC (Clearing Corporation) and Internal shortages
- Auction rate is applied on members who had delivery obligations but failed to deliver securities
- Close-out rate is the higher of: (a) highest price in the scrip from contract date to auction date, or (b) 20% above latest closing price on auction offer day
- Auction difference is collected from short delivering members when settlement price exceeds auction rate
- NCL executes close-out transactions at clearing member level for both CC and internal shortages
- Auction penalty applies only to CC-level shortages, not internal shortages
- Different reports available for various close-out scenarios on NSE website

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a clarificatory circular providing detailed explanations of existing auction procedures. References SEBI Master Circular SEBI/HO/MRDPoD2/CIR/P/2024/00181 dated December 30, 2024 for close-out rate definition.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must understand distinction between CC-level and internal shortage auctions
- Clearing members must pass close-out transactions to short delivering/receiving clients
- Members must handle close-out for internal shortages where valuation debit is unpaid as per clause 7.13(iv) of circular CMPT 67751 dated April 29, 2025
- Members must handle close-out for internal shortages in government securities and securities under corporate actions
- Members should access appropriate reports for different close-out scenarios from NSE website

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: November 24, 2025
- Circular Reference Number: 375/2025
- References prior circular NCL/CMPT/71045 dated October 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** This FAQ document provides important operational clarity for clearing members, custodians, and professional clearing members (PCMs) on handling shortage situations. It reduces ambiguity in auction processes and helps members understand their obligations and the calculation methodology for various charges.

**Financial Impact:** Members who fail to deliver securities face financial consequences through auction rates and potential close-out at higher rates. Understanding the difference between auction penalty (applicable only to CC shortages) versus auction difference (applicable to all shortages) helps members better manage their settlement obligations and associated costs.

**Reporting Impact:** Clear guidance on which reports contain close-out details for various scenarios (Auction Delivery P_0000 for internal shortages, Auction Delivery F_0000 for CC shortages, EquityT1 Delivery F_0000 for non-actionable series) enables members to efficiently track and reconcile their positions.

**Market Operations:** The circular enhances transparency in settlement operations and ensures consistent application of auction and close-out procedures across the capital market segment.
