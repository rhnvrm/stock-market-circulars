## Summary

National Stock Exchange of India has informed members about changes in the minimum installment number for Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) for daily frequency under all schemes of Edelweiss Mutual Fund on the NSE MF Invest Platform. The minimum installment number is being reduced from 20 to 15 installments, effective November 27, 2025. Additionally, investment dates have been updated from "all business days" to "only on business days" to improve operational efficiency.

## Key Points

- Change applies to all plans and options of Edelweiss Mutual Fund schemes
- Investment dates updated to "only on business days" (previously "all business days")
- Change aims to improve operational efficiency
- Notice cum addendum forms integral part of Statement of Additional Information (SAI)

## Regulatory Changes

This is an operational parameter change by Edelweiss Mutual Fund, not a regulatory mandate. The change modifies the minimum commitment required for investors using daily frequency SIP/STP options, making these investment plans more accessible by reducing the minimum number of installments required.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements for members. This is an informational circular about product parameter changes. Members should:
- Take note of the revised minimum installment numbers for client queries
- Update their systems/platforms if applicable
- Inform clients using or considering Edelweiss Mutual Fund daily SIP/STP options

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: November 26, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 27, 2025 - Revised minimum installment number and investment date parameters become effective

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a product-specific operational change affecting only Edelweiss Mutual Fund investors.

**Operational Impact**: Low. The reduction in minimum installments from 20 to 15 makes daily SIP/STP more accessible to investors who prefer shorter commitment periods. The clarification of investment dates to "only on business days" improves operational clarity.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for investors seeking daily SIP/STP options, as the lower minimum installment requirement provides greater flexibility and reduces the initial commitment threshold.
