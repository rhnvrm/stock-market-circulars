title: Changes in Price Bands from December 05, 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has announced changes to price bands for 47 securities effective from December 5, 2025. This surveillance measure restricts the maximum price movement allowed during trading sessions. Annexure I lists 34 securities subject to a 2% price band, while Annexure II lists at least 13 securities (partial list provided) subject to a 5% price band. The affected securities span multiple series including EQ (Equity), BE, BZ, ST, and SM, indicating various surveillance and trading categories.

## Key Points

- 34 securities moved to 2% price band (tighter restriction)
- Minimum 13 securities moved to 5% price band (moderate restriction)
- Effective date: December 5, 2025
- Covers securities across multiple trading series (EQ, BE, BZ, ST, SM)
- Includes companies from diverse sectors: pharmaceuticals, infrastructure, textiles, technology, FMCG, media
- Notable companies include Future Enterprises Limited, GVK Power & Infrastructure, MEP Infrastructure, Siti Networks, and Winsome Yarns in the 2% band
- 5% band includes AGS Transact Technologies, Aban Offshore, and Aditya Birla Sun Life CRISIL Liquid Overnight ETF

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements enhanced surveillance measures through price band restrictions. Price bands limit the maximum percentage change in stock price during a trading session from the previous closing price. The tighter 2% band significantly restricts volatility for 34 securities, while the 5% band applies moderate restrictions to others. These measures are typically applied to securities exhibiting unusual price movements, low liquidity, or requiring enhanced surveillance due to corporate actions or market concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure their systems are updated with new price band limits before market opening on December 5, 2025
- Orders placed beyond the applicable price band will be rejected
- Risk management systems must be recalibrated for affected securities
- Investors and traders need to adjust their trading strategies and stop-loss orders according to new bands
- Market surveillance teams must monitor compliance with new restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 5, 2025 - New price bands applicable from market opening
- **Circular Date**: December 4, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Severe restriction on intraday volatility for 34 securities with 2% bands will significantly limit trading opportunities and may reduce liquidity. Day traders and momentum strategies will be particularly affected.

**Investor Impact**: Long-term investors face limited immediate impact, but execution of large orders may become more challenging requiring multi-day accumulation or distribution.

**Market Liquidity**: Expected reduction in trading volumes for affected securities as arbitrage opportunities narrow and algorithmic trading systems may reduce participation.

**Risk Management**: Brokers and risk management systems must immediately update position limits and margin requirements for these securities to account for reduced volatility limits.

**Sector Concentration**: Multiple sectors affected including infrastructure (GVK, MEP, Ansal), textiles (Winsome, Soma, Gujarat Raffia), technology (TechD, 21st Century), and pharmaceuticals (Bafna, Aarey Drugs), indicating broad surveillance concerns across markets.
