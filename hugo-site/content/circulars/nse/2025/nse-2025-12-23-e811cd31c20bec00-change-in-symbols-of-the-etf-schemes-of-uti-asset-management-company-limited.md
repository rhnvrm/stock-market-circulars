## Symbol Changes

| Old Symbol | New Symbol | ETF Type |
|------------|------------|----------|
| UTINIFTETF | NIFTYBETA | Nifty ETF |
| UTISENSETF | SENSEXBETA | Sensex ETF |
| UTINEXT50 | NEXT50BETA | Nifty Next 50 ETF |

## Compliance Requirements

- All participants and custodians must update their trading systems to reflect the new symbols
- Ensure all contracts are transacted using the new symbols from December 24, 2025
- Update internal records and client communications regarding the symbol changes
- Coordinate with clearing and settlement systems for seamless transition

## Important Dates

- **December 18, 2025**: Original circular (NSE/CML/71881) issued regarding symbol changes
- **December 23, 2025**: SLBS circular issued by NSE Clearing Limited
- **December 24, 2025**: Effective date for symbol changes in Securities Lending and Borrowing Scheme

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Market participants, custodians, and trading members need to update their systems and processes to accommodate the new trading symbols. This includes modifications to order management systems, risk management platforms, and reporting tools.

**Market Impact**: Minimal direct market impact as these are administrative changes. The underlying securities and their ISIN codes remain unchanged. However, participants must ensure proper mapping to avoid trading disruptions.

**Borrowing/Lending Activities**: All securities lending and borrowing contracts involving these ETFs will need to reference the new symbols from the effective date. Historical data and reporting systems should maintain proper linkage between old and new symbols for continuity.
