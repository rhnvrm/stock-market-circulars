## Summary

NSE has announced the suspension of trading in securities of Shree Ram Proteins Limited (SRPL) effective August 28, 2025, due to non-compliance with SEBI Listing Regulations regarding board composition requirements for two consecutive quarters (December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025).

## Key Points

- Shree Ram Proteins Limited failed to comply with Regulation 17(1) regarding board composition
- Non-compliance occurred for two consecutive quarters: Q3 FY25 and Q4 FY25
- Trading suspension will be effective from August 28, 2025
- Company has until August 22, 2025 to achieve compliance
- After 15 days of suspension, limited trading will be allowed on Trade for Trade basis in Z category

## Regulatory Changes

Action taken pursuant to SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024, which outlines consequences for non-compliance with listing obligations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Shree Ram Proteins Limited must comply with Regulation 17(1) of SEBI Listing Regulations regarding board composition
- Compliance must be achieved by August 22, 2025 to avoid trading suspension
- Company must meet all provisions of the Master Circular to resume normal trading

## Important Dates

- **August 22, 2025**: Final deadline for compliance to avoid suspension
- **August 28, 2025**: Trading suspension becomes effective
- **After 15 days of suspension**: Limited trading allowed on Trade for Trade basis in Z category on first trading day of every week for six months

## Impact Assessment

The trading suspension represents a severe regulatory measure that will significantly impact shareholders' ability to trade the stock. The move to Z category with Trade for Trade basis after 15 days provides limited liquidity but restricts normal market operations. This action serves as a strong enforcement of corporate governance standards and may prompt other companies to ensure compliance with board composition requirements.
