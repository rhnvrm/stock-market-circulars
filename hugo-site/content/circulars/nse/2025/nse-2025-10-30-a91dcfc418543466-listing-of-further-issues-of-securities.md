## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal to negligible. These are routine ESOP allotments representing small percentages of existing share capital. HDFC Bank's 12.99 million shares, while the largest in this batch, represent a fraction of its enormous float.

**Liquidity Impact:** Marginal increase in tradeable shares. No lock-in restrictions mean shares are immediately available for trading, but quantities are relatively small.

**Shareholder Impact:** Dilution is minimal given the small number of shares relative to existing equity base for most companies. Existing shareholders experience negligible impact on ownership percentage.

**Operational Impact:** Standard listing process with no special trading conditions or restrictions. Securities will trade under existing symbols with market lot of 1.
