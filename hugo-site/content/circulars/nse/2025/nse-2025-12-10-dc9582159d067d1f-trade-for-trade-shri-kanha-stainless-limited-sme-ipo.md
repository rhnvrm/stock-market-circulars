This follows the earlier circular NSE/CML/71717 dated December 09, 2025 and is in accordance with SEBI guidelines referenced in circular CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012.

- This is pursuant to SEBI guidelines for SME IPO securities
- Reference to previous circular NSE/CML/71717 dated December 09, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The transfer to rolling segment typically improves liquidity and trading activity as it removes trade-for-trade restrictions. Investors will be able to trade the stock with standard margin facilities and settlement cycles.

**Operational Impact**: Low - This is a routine administrative change for post-IPO securities transitioning from restrictive to normal trading mode. Members need to update their systems to reflect the series change from ST to SM.
