## Summary

NSE has placed TV Vision Limited under the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) Framework Stage-I effective December 16, 2025. This surveillance action imposes a 100% margin requirement on all open and new positions in the security starting December 18, 2025. The circular references NSE's ongoing ASM framework designed to address market surveillance concerns.

- No securities shortlisted for Stage-IV (Trade-for-Trade segment shift)
- No securities moving between ASM stages in this circular
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- ASM shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the company
