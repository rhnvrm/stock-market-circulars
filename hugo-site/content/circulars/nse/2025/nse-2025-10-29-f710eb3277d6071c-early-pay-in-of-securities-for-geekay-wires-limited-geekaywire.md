## Compliance Requirements

- **Members/Custodians**: Execute early pay-in instructions in old ISIN (INE669X01024) on October 30-31, 2025 for applicable settlement numbers
- **Quantity Adjustment**: Adjust quantities based on pre-split ratio when using old ISIN (e.g., 1 old share for 2 new shares)

- **Pool Account Users**: Custodians providing early pay-in through pool accounts must upload client-wise allocation details based on actual traded quantity (post-split quantity)
- **Post Record Date**: Switch to new ISIN for all pay-in/early pay-in instructions after October 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Participants Affected**: All members, custodians, and PCMs dealing with Geekay Wires Limited securities, particularly those utilizing early pay-in facility for margin exemption.

**Risk**: Procedural errors in ISIN selection or quantity adjustment during the transition period could lead to operational issues. The requirement to use old ISIN with adjusted quantities on specific dates requires careful attention to detail.
