## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The listing of additional shares under ESOP/ESPS schemes represents a small fraction of total outstanding shares for large-cap companies. The quantities range from 1,474 shares (Havells) to 926,900 shares (ITC).

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible impact on overall liquidity given the relatively small number of shares being listed compared to existing free float.

**Dilution:** Minor dilution effect for existing shareholders as these are standard employee compensation-related issuances.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to update their systems with new distinctive number ranges, but this is routine administrative work.

**Investor Impact:** No direct impact on retail or institutional investors. Standard corporate action for employee benefit schemes.
