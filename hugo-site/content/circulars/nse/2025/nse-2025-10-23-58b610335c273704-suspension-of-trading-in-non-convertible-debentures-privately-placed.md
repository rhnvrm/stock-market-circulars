## Compliance Requirements

Members must note the suspension of the following securities:

1. **L&T Finance Limited** - ISIN: INE027E07CC6
2. **Clix Capital Services Private Limited** - ISIN: INE157D07DU3
3. **Larsen & Toubro Limited** - ISIN: INE018A08BK6

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 23, 2025
- **Suspension Effective Date**: October 24, 2025 (for all three NCDs)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The suspension affects holders of privately placed Non-Convertible Debentures in three companies. Since these are redemptions, investors will receive their principal back according to the terms of the debentures.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders in these three instruments will no longer be able to trade these securities on the exchange from October 24, 2025. However, this is a standard process for maturing debt securities, and investors should receive redemption proceeds as per the original terms.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the suspension and ensure no trades are executed in these ISINs after the suspension date. This is a routine operational update for debt market participants.
