## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has announced a face value split for Websol Energy System Limited (WEBELSOLAR). The face value and paid-up value of the company's equity shares will be subdivided from Rs. 10 per share to Re. 1 per share, representing a 1:10 split ratio. This change will be effective from November 14, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Websol Energy System Limited
- Stock Symbol: WEBELSOLAR
- Existing face value: Rs. 10 per share
- New face value: Re. 1 per share
- Split ratio: 1:10 (each existing share will become 10 shares)
- Effective date: November 14, 2025
- Circular reference: NSE/CML/71155, Circular No. 2153/2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action undertaken by Websol Energy System Limited that has received necessary approvals and is being implemented through the exchange mechanism.

## Compliance Requirements

- Stock exchange members must update their systems to reflect the new face value effective November 14, 2025
- Trading and settlement systems should be adjusted to accommodate the 1:10 split ratio
- Investors holding shares in physical form should exchange their old certificates for new ones reflecting the split
- Demat account holders will see automatic adjustment of their holdings

## Important Dates

- **November 6, 2025**: Circular issued by NSE
- **November 14, 2025**: Effective date for face value split

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The face value split will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10 times while proportionally reducing the price per share. This typically improves liquidity and makes the stock more accessible to retail investors by reducing the per-share price.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held, but the total value of their holdings will remain unchanged. The split is purely a cosmetic change that does not affect the company's market capitalization or shareholder equity.

**Trading Impact**: Post-split, the stock price will be approximately one-tenth of the pre-split price, potentially attracting more retail participation and improving trading volumes. Lot sizes for derivatives (if applicable) may also be adjusted proportionally.
