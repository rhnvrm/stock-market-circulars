## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification under Regulation 3.1.1 and 2.5.5 of NSE (Capital Market) Trading Regulations Part A.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members should update their systems to recognize the new security codes and ISIN numbers
- Securities to be identified by designated codes for trading purposes

- DCB Bank shares subject to lock-in period until October 9, 2030

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 26, 2025
- **Various Allotment Dates**: October 8, 2025 to November 21, 2025 (company-specific)
- **Lock-in Expiry (DCB Bank)**: October 9, 2030

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine administrative listing of further equity shares from corporate actions. The shares are already issued and this circular merely enables their trading on NSE.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in float for the 18 companies. The additional shares will add to tradable volumes, though the quantum varies significantly by company (from 22,577 shares for Aether Industries to 6,058,394 shares for DCB Bank).

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders unaffected as new shares are pari passu. ESOP beneficiaries and preferential allottees can now trade their holdings (subject to lock-in where applicable).
