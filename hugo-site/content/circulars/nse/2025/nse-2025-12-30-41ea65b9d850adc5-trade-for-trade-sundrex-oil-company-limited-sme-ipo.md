## Summary

The National Stock Exchange has announced that Sundrex Oil Company Limited (Symbol: SOCL) will be transferred from the trade-for-trade segment (Series: ST) to the rolling segment (Series: SM) effective January 13, 2026. This follows the company's SME IPO and is issued pursuant to SEBI guidelines dated January 20, 2012.

## Key Points
