## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - This operational calendar affects participants holding open positions in commodity derivatives contracts expiring in late December 2025 and early January 2026. The compulsory delivery mechanism requires physical settlement which impacts liquidity and position management strategies.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Members must ensure adequate arrangements for physical delivery of commodities and funds. The year-end timing (December 26-31) and New Year period (January 1-2) may require additional operational coordination.

**Compliance Impact:** Medium - Strict adherence to delivery intention marking windows and settlement timelines is mandatory. Non-compliance attracts penalties. The T+1 settlement cycle requires efficient back-office operations.

**Contact Information:** Members can reach NSE Clearing Limited at toll-free number 1800 266 0057 or email DL-NSCCL-COMM-CNS@nsccl.co.in for queries regarding the settlement calendar.
