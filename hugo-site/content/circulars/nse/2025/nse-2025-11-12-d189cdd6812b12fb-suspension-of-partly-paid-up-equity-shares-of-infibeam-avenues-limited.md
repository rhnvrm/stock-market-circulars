---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has announced the suspension of trading in partly paid-up equity shares of Infibeam Avenues Limited (Symbol: INFIBPP, ISIN: IN9483S01010) effective November 14, 2025. The suspension is implemented in accordance with Regulation 3.1.2 of the NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A and is due to the first and final call on these partly paid-up shares.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies specifically to partly paid-up equity shares (INFIBPP) of Infibeam Avenues Limited
- ISIN of suspended security: IN9483S01010
- Suspension reason: First and final call on partly paid-up shares
- Regulatory basis: Regulation 3.1.2 of NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A
- Circular issued by NSE Listing Department

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This action is pursuant to existing NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A, Regulation 3.1.2, which governs suspension of securities under specific circumstances including call payments on partly paid-up shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must cease trading in INFIBPP shares from the closing hours of November 13, 2025
- Shareholders holding partly paid-up shares must respond to the first and final call as per company requirements
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect the suspension status of the security

## Important Dates

- **November 12, 2025**: Circular issued by NSE
- **November 13, 2025**: Last day of trading (suspension effective from closing hours)
- **November 14, 2025**: Suspension becomes effective

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited and specific to holders of partly paid-up equity shares of Infibeam Avenues Limited. The suspension affects only the INFIBPP security and not the fully paid-up equity shares of the company. This is a procedural suspension related to the completion of the call payment process.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders holding INFIBPP shares will be unable to trade these securities from November 14, 2025. They must complete the first and final call payment obligations. Once the call process is completed and shares are converted to fully paid-up status, normal trading may resume or shares may be consolidated into the main equity series.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal operational impact on broader market operations. This is a routine corporate action affecting a specific class of shares during the call payment process.
