## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** The move to Stage I GSM significantly restricts trading flexibility for EUROTEX INDUSTRIES AND EXPORTS LIMITED. The 100% margin requirement increases capital requirements for traders, while the 5% price band limits daily price movements.

**Liquidity Impact:** Trade-to-trade settlement without netting off reduces liquidity and increases settlement obligations, making intraday trading strategies unfeasible.

**Investor Impact:** Retail and institutional investors face higher capital requirements and reduced ability to enter/exit positions quickly. This surveillance action signals potential concerns about the security's trading patterns or corporate governance.

**Market Implications:** The GSM framework is designed to protect investors by increasing transparency and reducing speculative trading in securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or other concerns. Placement in Stage I serves as an early warning to market participants.
