## Important Dates

- **November 28, 2025**: Trade start date
- **December 11, 2025**: Trade end date (early pay-in deadline 3:30 PM)
- **December 24, 2025**: Obligation download date

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: High impact for SAL Steel Limited shareholders who wish to participate in the takeover offer. Shareholders must ensure their shares are available for early pay-in and meet all eligibility criteria to avoid rejection.

**Broker/Member Impact**: Trading members and custodians need to coordinate with clients for timely early pay-in of shares and ensure all documentation is in order. They must monitor 26 different rejection codes that could lead to order rejection or partial acceptance.

**Market Impact**: Limited to SAL Steel Limited and its stakeholders. The tender offer process follows established procedures with clear timelines. The settlement may be delayed if there are issues with RTA acceptance details or funds pay-in, which could affect participant liquidity planning.

**Operational Considerations**: The 14-day trading window provides adequate time for participation. The 13-day gap between trade end and obligation download allows for processing of acceptance details. Members should prepare for potential settlement schedule revisions due to operational delays.
