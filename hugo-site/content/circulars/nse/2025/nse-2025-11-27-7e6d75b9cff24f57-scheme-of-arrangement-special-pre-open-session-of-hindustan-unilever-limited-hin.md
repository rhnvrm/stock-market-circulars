- One-hour call auction session with order-level risk management applicable to 're-listed scrips'
- All unmatched orders within dynamic price band will move to normal trading session at limit price

- Members must load updated security.gz/nnf_security.gz file before trading on December 5, 2025
- Files available from common/NTNEAT directory on Extranet server

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements SEBI guidelines for special pre-open sessions during scheme of arrangement:
- Risk management framework as per SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/01/2012 para 5 applies
- Dynamic price band mechanism for order matching
- Contingency provisions for failed price discovery

## Compliance Requirements

- **All Members**: Must refer to Chapter 1.2 in circular NSE/CMTR/67774 dated April 30, 2025 for SPOS details
- **Trading Members**: Must load updated security files before December 5, 2025 trading session
- **Order Management**: Follow order-level risk management rules for re-listed scrips
- **Technical Setup**: Obtain security.gz/nnf_security.gz files from Extranet server directory

## Important Dates

- **December 5, 2025**: Special Pre-Open Session from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM
- **December 5, 2025**: HINDUNILVR eligible for second session of block deal window (subject to successful price discovery)
- **Before December 5, 2025**: Members must update trading application with latest security files

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Major corporate restructuring requiring special trading mechanism for one of India's largest consumer goods companies. The SPOS ensures orderly price discovery post-scheme of arrangement.

**Trading Impact**: HINDUNILVR will have restricted trading during SPOS period. Normal trading resumes only after successful price discovery. Block deal eligibility limited to second session with VWAP as base price.

**Operational Impact**: Members must ensure technical readiness by updating security files. Failed price discovery will result in continued call auction mechanism, affecting normal trading operations.

**Investor Impact**: All orders must be placed during one-hour SPOS window. Unmatched orders within price band carry forward to normal session, but orders outside band may be cancelled if equilibrium price fails to discover.
