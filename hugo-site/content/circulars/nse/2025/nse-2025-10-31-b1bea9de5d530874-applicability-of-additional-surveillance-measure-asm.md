title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - November 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has issued updates to the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) Framework effective November 03, 2025. The circular announces changes to Long-Term ASM stages for various securities, including one new security entering Stage-I (PPAP Automotive Limited), one security moving down from Stage-III to Stage-II (Sri Adhikari Brothers Television Network Limited), and eight securities being excluded from the ASM Framework entirely.

## Key Points

- PPAP Automotive Limited (PPAP) newly shortlisted in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- Sri Adhikari Brothers Television Network Limited (SABTNL) moves from Stage-III to Stage-II
- 8 securities excluded from ASM Framework: BALCO, GARUDA, HIRECT, NURECA, SELMC, SHARDACROP, STLTECH, and VR
- No securities moving to or from Stage-IV
- No securities advancing to higher surveillance stages
- Changes effective from November 03, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Long-Term ASM Framework applies surveillance measures to securities based on specific criteria. Securities in higher stages face stricter trading restrictions. Stage-IV securities under Criteria VII are shifted from Rolling Settlement (Series: EQ) to Trade for Trade (Series: BE) on a T+3 basis.

## Securities Affected

**New Entry to Stage-I:**
- PPAP Automotive Limited (PPAP) - ISIN: INE095I01015

**Moving from Stage-III to Stage-II:**
- Sri Adhikari Brothers Television Network Limited (SABTNL) - ISIN: INE416A01044

**Excluded from ASM Framework:**
1. Solve Plastic Products Limited (BALCO) - ISIN: INE0U0201016
2. Garuda Construction and Engineering Limited (GARUDA) - ISIN: INE0JVO01026
3. Hind Rectifiers Limited (HIRECT) - ISIN: INE835D01023
4. Nureca Limited (NURECA) - ISIN: INE0DSF01015
5. SEL Manufacturing Company Limited (SELMC) - ISIN: INE105I01020
6. Sharda Cropchem Limited (SHARDACROP) - ISIN: INE221J01015
7. Sterlite Technologies Limited (STLTECH) - ISIN: INE089C01029
8. V R Infraspace Limited (VR) - ISIN: INE0QQM01017

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** November 03, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Securities entering or moving within ASM stages face enhanced surveillance and may have trading restrictions including price bands, trade-for-trade settlements, and reduced position limits. The exclusion of 8 securities from ASM Framework indicates improved compliance or market behavior for those companies. PPAP Automotive shareholders should be aware of Stage-I surveillance measures, while SABTNL investors will see relaxed surveillance as it moves from Stage-III to Stage-II.
