## Summary

NSE has placed three securities under Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I effective November 27, 2025. The affected securities are Greenleaf Envirotech Limited, Integrity Infrabuild Developers Limited, and Magellanic Cloud Limited. This surveillance action imposes a 50% margin requirement (or existing margin, whichever is higher, capped at 100%) on all positions. Additionally, two securities - GE Power India Limited and Shubhlaxmi Jewel Art Limited - are being excluded from the ASM framework.

## Key Points

- Three securities added to ST-ASM Stage I framework
- Margin requirement set at 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), maximum capped at 100%
- No securities added to ST-ASM Stage II
- No securities moving between Stage I and Stage II
- Two securities excluded from ASM framework (GVPIL moved out, SHUBHLAXMI moved to ESM framework)
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

The exchange has invoked the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework for the identified securities based on surveillance criteria. This framework is designed to address unusual price movements or trading patterns in securities.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Apply 50% margin (or existing margin, whichever is higher) on all positions in the three affected securities
- Maximum margin capped at 100%
- Margin applies to all open positions as on November 27, 2025
- Margin applies to new positions created from November 28, 2025 onwards

**For Market Participants:**
- Be aware that ASM framework works alongside all other existing surveillance measures
- Note that surveillance action should not be construed as adverse action against the company

## Important Dates

- **November 26, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 27, 2025**: ST-ASM Stage I becomes effective; margin applicable on all open positions
- **November 28, 2025**: Margin applicable on new positions created from this date

## Securities Affected

**Added to ST-ASM Stage I:**
1. Greenleaf Envirotech Limited (GREENLEAF) - ISIN: INE0PLX01017
2. Integrity Infrabuild Developers Limited (INTEGRITY) - ISIN: INE0YSH01017
3. Magellanic Cloud Limited (MCLOUD) - ISIN: INE613C01026

2. Shubhlaxmi Jewel Art Limited (SHUBHLAXMI) - ISIN: INE01Z401013 (Moved to ESM framework)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:**
- Increased margin requirements will reduce leverage available to traders in these three securities
- Higher capital requirements may decrease trading volumes and liquidity in affected stocks
- Existing position holders need to ensure adequate margins by November 27, 2025

**Market Impact:**
- Limited overall market impact as only three small-cap securities are affected
- Signals heightened regulatory scrutiny on price movements in these specific stocks
- May deter speculative trading activity in the affected securities

**Investor Impact:**
- Investors trading these securities will need to maintain higher margins
- Potential margin calls for those with insufficient funds
- Trading costs effectively increase due to higher capital requirements
