## Regulatory Framework

- Regulation 3.1.1 of NSE (Capital Market) Trading Regulations Part A (admission to dealings)
- Regulation 2.5.5 of NSE (Capital Market) Trading Regulations Part A (lot size specifications)
- SEBI Circular CIR/MRD/DP/21/2012 dated August 02, 2012 (temporary ISIN for additional issues)
- SEBI Circular CIR/MRD/DP/24/2012 dated September 11, 2012 (ISIN activation procedures)

- **November 30, 2028**: Lock-in expiry for 6,489,150 units (15.01% of total)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The preferential allotment of 43.26 million units represents a substantial increase in the unit base of Capital Infra Trust. With approximately 85% of the newly allotted units having a shorter 1-year lock-in period (expiring November 2026), there could be increased supply pressure on the market once this lock-in expires.

**Liquidity Impact**: Trading will commence on November 18, 2025, but actual tradable float will be limited until lock-in periods expire. The staggered lock-in structure (1-year for 85% and 3-years for 15%) will create phased liquidity events.

**Investor Impact**: Existing unitholders will experience dilution from this preferential issue. The Rs. 79.75 issue price will serve as a reference point for valuation. Investors should monitor the pricing relative to market prices and assess the preferential allottees' intentions post lock-in expiry.

**Operational Impact**: The use of temporary ISIN initially requires coordination between depositories and the trust for eventual transfer to permanent ISIN, which is standard procedure for additional issues per SEBI guidelines.
