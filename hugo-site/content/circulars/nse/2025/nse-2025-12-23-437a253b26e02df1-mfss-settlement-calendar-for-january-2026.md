---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued the settlement calendar for the Mutual Fund Service System (MFSS) for January 2026. The circular details settlement schedules for three transaction types: MFSS Subscription (Settlement Type 'S'), MFSS Liquid Subscription (Settlement Type 'K'), and MFSS Redemption (Settlement Type 'U'). The settlement schedules outline payin/payout dates for funds and units across all trading days in January 2026.

## Key Points

- Settlement calendar covers January 1-30, 2026 for all MFSS transaction types
- MFSS Subscription (Type 'S') follows T+1 settlement for units payout
- MFSS Liquid Subscription (Type 'K') follows T-day settlement for both funds and units
- MFSS Redemption (Type 'U') follows scheme-specific settlement timelines (T+1 through T+8)
- Funds settlement depends on the scheme category and fund's settlement day
- 21 settlement cycles scheduled for both subscription types in January 2026
- Category codes for scheme categories and settlement days provided in Annexure 'D'

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine operational calendar publication.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. Participants should:
- Follow the published settlement schedule for fund and unit movements
- Check scheme category in scheme master to determine applicable settlement day
- Ensure timely payin of funds and receipt of units as per scheduled dates

## Important Dates

**January 2026 Settlement Schedule:**
- First settlement: January 1, 2026 (Settlement No. S/K/U 2026001)
- Last settlement: January 30, 2026 (Settlement No. S/K 2026021)
- Note: January 26, 2026 is a holiday (Republic Day) - no settlements scheduled
- February 2, 2026: Payout date for last subscription settlement of January (S2026021)

**Settlement Patterns:**
- Subscription (Type S): T-day funds payin, T+1 units payout
- Liquid Subscription (Type K): T-day funds and units settlement
- Redemption (Type U): T-day unit transfer, T+1 to T+8 funds payout depending on scheme category

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal - routine operational calendar with no changes to settlement processes.

**Operational Impact:** Low - provides necessary planning information for mutual fund participants, clearing members, and registrar & transfer agents to manage settlement obligations. The calendar ensures all stakeholders are aligned on settlement dates, particularly around the Republic Day holiday on January 26, 2026.

**Participant Action Required:** Informational only - participants should note the settlement dates for operational planning and ensure adequate funds/units availability on scheduled settlement days.
