## Summary

NSE has updated the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective December 23, 2025. One security (Graphisads Limited) has been added to ST-ASM Stage I, while three securities have been excluded from the ASM framework. The consolidated ASM list now contains 29 securities across Stage I and Stage II.

## Key Points

- Graphisads Limited (INE0POU01017) added to ST-ASM Stage I
- Three securities excluded from ASM framework: Neptune Petrochemicals Limited, Suratwwala Business Group Limited, and TCI Finance Limited
- TCI Finance Limited moved from ST-ASM to Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework
- No securities moving between Stage I and Stage II
- No securities in ST-ASM Stage II currently
- Total of 29 securities remain under ASM framework (28 in Stage I, 1 in Stage II)

## Regulatory Changes

**Additions to ST-ASM Stage I:**
- Graphisads Limited (Symbol: GRAPHISAD, ISIN: INE0POU01017)

**Exclusions from ASM Framework:**
- Neptune Petrochemicals Limited (Symbol: NEPTUNE, ISIN: INE156901014)
- Suratwwala Business Group Limited (Symbol: SBGLP, ISIN: INE05ST01028)
- TCI Finance Limited (Symbol: TCIFINANCE, ISIN: INE911B01018) - transferred to ESM framework

## Compliance Requirements

Securities under ST-ASM framework are subject to:
- Enhanced surveillance measures as per SEBI/NSE guidelines
- Additional disclosure and monitoring requirements
- Potential trading restrictions based on stage classification
- Investors and market participants must comply with applicable ST-ASM framework conditions

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** December 22, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 23, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**For Graphisads Limited:** Placement in ST-ASM Stage I indicates heightened surveillance due to price volatility or other surveillance parameters. This may result in increased scrutiny, potential trading restrictions, and additional compliance obligations.

**For Excluded Securities:** Neptune Petrochemicals and Suratwwala Business Group are removed from surveillance framework, indicating improved compliance or stabilized trading patterns. TCI Finance's movement to ESM suggests continued surveillance concerns requiring enhanced monitoring.

**Market Impact:** Limited to affected securities. The consolidated ASM list maintains 29 securities under various stages of surveillance, representing ongoing market monitoring efforts by NSE.
