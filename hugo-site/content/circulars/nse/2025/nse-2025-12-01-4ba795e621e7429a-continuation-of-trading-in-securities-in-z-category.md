## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**

- Execute trades only on Trade for Trade basis
- Ensure settlement compliance as per NSE guidelines for Z Category securities
- Monitor continuation status of these securities

**For Investors:**
- Understand liquidity constraints in Z Category securities
- Trades settled on compulsory delivery basis (no intraday, no carry forward)
- Higher risk due to regulatory non-compliance of underlying companies

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 12, 2025
- **Non-Compliance Period:** March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025 (two consecutive financial years)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Continued restricted trading for 19 securities with limited liquidity
- Trade for Trade settlement restricts speculative activity and intraday trading
- Investor confidence remains low for these non-compliant entities

**Investor Impact:**
- HIGH - Existing shareholders face continued illiquidity and settlement restrictions
- Limited exit opportunities due to reduced trading interest
- Compulsory delivery-based settlement increases holding risk
- Signals ongoing governance and compliance issues at company level

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members must continue surveillance and client disclosure for these securities
- Settlement processes remain on T+T basis without netting benefits
- No change to existing operational procedures as companies already in Z Category

**Compliance Signal:**
- Persistent non-compliance (two consecutive years) indicates serious governance concerns
- Companies failing basic disclosure requirements pose elevated investment risk
- Continuation in Z Category suggests no remedial action taken by these entities
