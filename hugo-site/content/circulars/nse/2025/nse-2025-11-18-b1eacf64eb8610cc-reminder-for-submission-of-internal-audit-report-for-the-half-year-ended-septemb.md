**Market Impact:** Low - This is an internal compliance matter affecting Trading Members' operations rather than market functioning or trading activities.

**Member Impact:** Medium - All Trading Members are required to comply. Members who have not yet completed their internal audits face time pressure to meet the November 30, 2025 deadline to avoid penalties.
