## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date:** November 20, 2025
- **Suspension Effective Date:** November 21, 2025 (for all five instruments)

## Impact Assessment

The suspension of these NCDs represents a routine market event as these privately placed debt instruments reach their redemption dates. The impact is limited to existing holders of these specific ISINs who will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms of issuance. No new trading will be permitted in these instruments from the suspension date. The presence of established issuers like Tata Capital, Export Import Bank of India, and telecom-related entities (Indus Towers, Bharti Telecom) indicates these are scheduled maturities rather than distressed situations.
