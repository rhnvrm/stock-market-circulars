## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it is a routine announcement of a new ETF product launch. It provides investment opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the chemicals sector through a passive index-tracking instrument. The launch expands the product offerings on NSE MF Invest Platform but does not affect existing market operations or require changes to trading/settlement processes. Members need to ensure timely fund settlement for NFO subscriptions processed through their platform.
