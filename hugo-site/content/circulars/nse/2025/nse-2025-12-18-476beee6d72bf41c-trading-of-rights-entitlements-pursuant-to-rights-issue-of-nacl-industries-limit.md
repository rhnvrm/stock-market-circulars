## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Creates a short 3-day trading window for NACL shareholders to trade their rights entitlements before the issue closing date.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders holding rights entitlements must act within the brief trading period to either sell their REs or exercise them by applying with requisite money. Failure to act will result in lapse of entitlements.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update systems to handle NACL-RE symbol, implement Trade to Trade settlement, ensure compulsory demat compliance, and distribute mandatory disclaimers in contract notes for all RE purchase transactions.
