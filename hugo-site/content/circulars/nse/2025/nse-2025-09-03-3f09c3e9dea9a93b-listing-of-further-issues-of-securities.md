## Summary

NSE has admitted additional securities from 15 companies to trading on the Capital Market segment effective September 4, 2025. The circular covers equity shares allotted under Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and preferential issues, with specified security codes, lot sizes, and lock-in details.

## Key Points

- 15 companies have additional securities admitted for trading
- Securities include ESOP allotments and preferential issues
- All securities will trade with market lot size of 1
- Most ESOP allotments have no lock-in restrictions
- GRM Overseas preferential issue has lock-in periods until March 2026
- Trading identification will be by designated security codes only

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes - this is a standard listing notification under existing NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A (Regulations 3.1.1 and 2.5.5).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use designated security codes for identification
- Trading must be conducted in specified lot sizes as per annexure
- Lock-in restrictions must be observed where applicable

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: September 4, 2025
- **GRM Overseas Lock-in Expiry**: March 6-7, 2026 (varying tranches)

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on market liquidity as additional shares from 15 established companies become available for trading. The ESOP allotments reflect employee participation programs, while preferential issues may indicate capital raising activities. Lock-in restrictions on GRM Overseas shares will limit immediate trading volume for those securities.
