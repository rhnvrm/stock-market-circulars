## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The listing of 5.5 million Adani Green Energy shares from warrant conversion represents significant additional supply, though the lock-in until May 2027 limits immediate trading impact. The issue price of Rs 1480.75 provides a reference point for market participants.

**Liquidity Impact:** Low to Medium - ESOP allotments across companies like Axis Bank and CG Power are relatively small and will have minimal impact on overall liquidity. All securities trading with lot size of 1 enhances retail accessibility.

**Dilution Impact:** Company-specific - Shareholders should assess dilution based on individual company capitalization. Adani Green Energy's 5.5 million share addition is the most material among the listed issuances.

**Operational Impact:** Low - Routine listing process with standard compliance requirements for trading members. No changes to trading systems or processes required beyond updating security master data.
