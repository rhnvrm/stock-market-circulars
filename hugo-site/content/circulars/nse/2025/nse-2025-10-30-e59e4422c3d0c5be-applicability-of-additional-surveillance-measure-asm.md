## Summary

NSE has issued updates to the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) Framework effective October 31, 2025. The circular identifies securities being moved between different ASM stages under the Long-Term ASM Framework. Only one security, InfoBeans Technologies Limited (INFOBEAN), is being moved from Stage I to Stage II. No securities are being added to or excluded from the ASM framework in this update.

## Key Points

- InfoBeans Technologies Limited (Symbol: INFOBEAN, ISIN: INE344S01016) is moving from Long-Term ASM Framework Stage I to Stage II
- No new securities are being added to ASM Stage I or Stage IV
- No securities are being excluded from the ASM Framework
- No securities are moving to Stage IV (Trade for Trade basis)
- The consolidated ASM list includes multiple securities across different stages, with AXISCADES Technologies Limited noted at Stage IV
- All changes are effective from October 31, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Long-Term ASM Framework continues to operate with its multi-stage surveillance mechanism:

- Stage IV securities are shifted from Rolling Settlement (Series: EQ) to Trade for Trade (Series: BE) on a T+3 basis
- Securities meeting criteria under Criteria VII are subject to immediate Trade for Trade settlement
- Progressive stages indicate increasing surveillance intensity based on security behavior patterns

## Compliance Requirements

**For Market Participants:**
- Review positions in INFOBEAN ahead of the Stage II migration
- Apply enhanced due diligence for securities under ASM framework
- Ensure awareness of trading restrictions applicable to Stage IV securities
- Monitor the consolidated ASM list for portfolio exposure assessment

**For Brokers:**
- Update surveillance systems to reflect stage changes
- Inform clients holding positions in affected securities
- Apply appropriate margin and position limit requirements

## Important Dates

- **October 31, 2025**: Effective date for all ASM stage changes
- **October 31, 2025**: InfoBeans Technologies Limited moves to Stage II

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Limited immediate market impact as only one security is changing stages
- InfoBeans Technologies Limited may experience increased margin requirements and trading restrictions at Stage II
- Enhanced surveillance may lead to increased price discovery and reduced volatility manipulation

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers need to update risk management systems for INFOBEAN
- Investors in INFOBEAN should expect higher surveillance scrutiny
- Stage II typically involves additional reporting and monitoring requirements

**Trading Impact:**
- Stage II securities face stricter surveillance but remain in rolling settlement
- No immediate shift to Trade for Trade settlement for INFOBEAN
- Market participants should review their exposure to all ASM securities listed in the consolidated annexure
