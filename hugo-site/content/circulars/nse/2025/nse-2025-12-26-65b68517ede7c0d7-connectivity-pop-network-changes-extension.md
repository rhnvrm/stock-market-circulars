title: Connectivity - POP Network Changes - Extension for Self-Service Links
---

## Summary

NSE has extended the migration deadline for self-service lease line connectivity from existing Sify POPs (STT Ultadanga Kolkata and Jivan Vihar Delhi) to new POP locations. The deadline has been extended from December 26, 2025 to January 09, 2026 due to little progress in migration and member representations. After this date, the old POPs will be permanently discontinued by the Telecom Network Integrator (TNI).

## Key Points

- Migration deadline extended exclusively for self-service links until EOD January 09, 2026
- Existing POPs at STT Kolkata and Jivan Vihar Delhi to be discontinued after the extended deadline
- New POPs: SIFY KOL (replacing STT Kolkata) and SIFY OKHLA (replacing Jivan Vihar)
- Extension granted due to little progress in self-service link migration
- Members must complete migration to avoid service disruption
- Managed service connectivity not affected by this extension

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational infrastructure update with an extended compliance timeline for members using self-service connectivity model.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members with self-service links subscribed to STT Kolkata POP must migrate to SIFY KOL POP by January 09, 2026
- Members with self-service links subscribed to Jivan Vihar Delhi POP must migrate to SIFY OKHLA POP by January 09, 2026
- Members must coordinate migration activities with Sify using the provided escalation matrix
- For new line configuration and link health issues at POP level, members should contact Sify NOC (18004199963 / 044-61332900) or email nse.servicedesk@sifycorp.com

## Important Dates

- **August 05, 2025**: Initial migration announcement (Circular NSE/MSD/69495)
- **November 07, 2025**: Follow-up circular (NSE/MSD/71183)
- **November 28, 2025**: Follow-up circular (NSE/MSD/71535)
- **December 09, 2025**: Follow-up circular (NSE/MSD/71715)
- **December 26, 2025**: Original discontinuation deadline (now extended)
- **January 09, 2026**: Extended deadline for completing self-service link migration (EOD)
- **January 10, 2026**: Existing POPs will be discontinued

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Members who fail to migrate their self-service connectivity links by January 09, 2026 will face complete service disruption as the old POPs will be permanently shut down. This affects trading connectivity and market access.

**Member Action Required**: High urgency for members currently using self-service links at the affected POPs. Members must proactively coordinate with Sify to complete physical migration of their lease line connectivity.

**Service Continuity**: The extension provides additional time (14 days from original deadline) for members to complete migration without service interruption. The circular includes comprehensive Sify escalation matrix with NOC contacts (Level 1-5) and onsite team contacts for support during migration.

**Risk**: Members who delay migration risk losing connectivity on January 10, 2026, which could impact their ability to trade and fulfill regulatory obligations.
