---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has extended the deadline for submission of Annual Returns for Financial Year 2024-25 from December 31, 2025 to January 31, 2026. This extension follows the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) General Circular No. 08/2025 dated December 30, 2025, which provides relaxation of additional fees and extension of time for filing financial statements and annual returns under the Companies Act, 2013.

## Key Points

- Annual Returns submission deadline extended to January 31, 2026
- Extension applies to Financial Year 2024-25 (ended March 31, 2025)
- Members must submit returns through ENIT portal (https://enit.nseindia.com/MemberPortal/)
- Non-submission or delayed submission will attract penalty/disciplinary actions
- Extension follows MCA General Circular No. 08/2025 dated December 30, 2025
- Previous circulars referenced: NSE/COMP/70513 (September 30, 2025) and NSE/COMP/71085 (October 31, 2025)

## Regulatory Changes

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued General Circular No. 08/2025 on December 30, 2025, providing relaxation of additional fees and extension of time for filing Financial Statements and Annual Returns under the Companies Act, 2013. This circular continues the relief provided in earlier General Circular No. 06/2025 dated October 17, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must submit Annual Returns for Financial Year 2024-25 (ended March 31, 2025)
- Submission must be made through the ENIT portal at https://enit.nseindia.com/MemberPortal/
- Deadline for submission: January 31, 2026
- Non-compliance will result in penalties and disciplinary actions as per Exchange Circular NSE/INSP/70746 dated October 10, 2025
- Members should contact helpdesk at 1800 266 0050 (IVR option 3) or email memcompliance_support@nse.co.in for support

## Important Dates

- **December 30, 2025**: MCA issued General Circular No. 08/2025
- **December 31, 2025**: Original deadline for Annual Returns submission (now extended)
- **December 31, 2025**: NSE Circular issued
- **January 31, 2026**: New extended deadline for submission of Annual Returns for FY 2024-25

## Impact Assessment

This circular provides operational relief to NSE members by extending the compliance deadline by one month. The extension aligns with the MCA's broader regulatory relief for companies filing financial statements and annual returns. Members who were facing challenges in meeting the December 31, 2025 deadline now have additional time to ensure compliance. However, members should note that penalties and disciplinary actions will still apply for non-submission or delayed submission beyond the extended deadline of January 31, 2026.
