## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The listing of ESOP shares represents routine corporate actions with negligible dilution impact on existing shareholders. The quantities are relatively small compared to the total outstanding shares of these established companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in tradable float. ESOP shares typically have staggered vesting and exercise patterns, so immediate market supply impact is limited.

**Investor Impact**: No direct impact on existing investors. Shares are issued at a premium through ESOP schemes and are fully fungible with existing shares without restrictions.
