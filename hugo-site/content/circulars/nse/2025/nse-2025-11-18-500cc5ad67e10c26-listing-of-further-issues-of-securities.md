## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the designated security codes for trading these securities
- Trading shall be conducted in the specified lot sizes (market lot of 1 share)

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: November 18, 2025
- **Effective Date for Listing**: November 19, 2025
- **IDFC First Bank Lock-in Expiry**: July 31, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to minimal. Most allotments are routine ESOP exercises with small quantities relative to existing share capital. The exception is IDFC First Bank's preferential issue of 812.69 million shares, which is substantial but subject to lock-in until July 31, 2026, preventing immediate market impact.

**Investor Impact**: ESOP allotments increase total shares outstanding marginally for most companies. IDFC First Bank shareholders should note the significant dilution from the preferential issue, though locked-in shares will not affect immediate trading liquidity.

**Trading Impact**: All securities will be available for trading from November 19, 2025, in standard market lots of 1 share, maintaining existing trading mechanisms.
