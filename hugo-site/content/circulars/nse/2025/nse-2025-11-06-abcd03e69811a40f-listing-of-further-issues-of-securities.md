## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative circular with minimal market impact. The listing of further issues represents normal corporate actions (primarily ESOP allotments) by existing listed companies. The securities are pari passu with existing shares, meaning they carry the same rights and privileges. The total number of new securities across all 25 companies represents a small fraction of their respective outstanding shares, and therefore will not materially impact trading volumes or market capitalization. No changes to trading regulations or compliance requirements are introduced.
