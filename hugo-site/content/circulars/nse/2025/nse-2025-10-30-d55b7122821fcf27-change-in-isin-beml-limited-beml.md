## Summary

National Stock Exchange has announced a change in ISIN code for BEML Limited (Symbol: BEML) effective November 03, 2025. The new ISIN INE258A01024 will replace the existing ISIN due to sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs. 10/- to Rs. 5/-. The new ISIN will be applicable for all trades executed on and from the ex-date.

## Key Points

- Company: BEML Limited (Symbol: BEML)
- New ISIN: INE258A01024
- Reason: Sub-division of shares from Rs. 10/- to Rs. 5/- face value
- Effective date for new ISIN: November 03, 2025 (Ex-date)
- Circular Reference: NSE/CML/71036, Circular No. 2111/2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action involving share sub-division that requires ISIN code modification as per established procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Exchange members must update their systems with the new ISIN code INE258A01024 for BEML Limited
- All trades executed on or after November 03, 2025 must use the new ISIN
- Trading and settlement systems must be configured to recognize the new share denomination of Rs. 5/-

## Important Dates

- **October 30, 2025**: Circular issued by NSE
- **November 03, 2025**: Ex-date - New ISIN becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares while proportionally reducing the share price, potentially improving liquidity and making shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Exchange members, brokers, and market infrastructure providers must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN and face value. Existing shareholders will automatically receive shares at the new denomination in proportion to their holdings.

**Trading Impact**: The corporate action will result in price adjustment on the ex-date, with the share price theoretically reducing to half (accounting for the 2:1 split ratio from Rs. 10 to Rs. 5).
