## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a routine preferential allotment listing for an SME company with a relatively small issue size of 70,000 shares (Rs. 3.03 crores at issue price).

**Liquidity Impact:** Limited immediate impact on liquidity due to lock-in restrictions until May 2027. The shares are subject to preferential allotment lock-in norms.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders should note dilution from this preferential issue. New shares are pari passu with existing equity, meaning they carry equal rights.

**Trading Considerations:** Market lot of 250 shares requires minimum investment of approximately Rs. 1.08 lakhs at issue price for trading on the exchange.
