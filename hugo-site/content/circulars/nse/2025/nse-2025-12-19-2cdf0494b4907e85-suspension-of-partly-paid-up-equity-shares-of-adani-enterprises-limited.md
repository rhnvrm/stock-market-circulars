## Impact Assessment

This suspension affects investors holding partly paid-up equity shares of Adani Enterprises Limited. The suspension prevents any further trading in these securities until the first call money matter is resolved. Investors will be unable to buy or sell ADANIENPP shares during the suspension period. This is a routine regulatory action associated with the partly paid-up share call money process and does not affect the company's fully paid-up equity shares trading under the regular symbol.
