## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine administrative action based on existing NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A, Regulation 3.1.2, which governs the suspension of securities upon maturity.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance actions required from market participants. Members are notified of the suspension for informational purposes. Trading in the specified NCDs must cease from the effective date.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: November 19, 2025
- **Effective Date of Suspension**: November 21, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine corporate action related to the natural maturity of debt securities. The suspension affects only two specific NCDs and does not impact the equity shares or other securities of Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company Limited.

**Investor Impact**: Low. Investors holding these NCDs would have been aware of the maturity dates as per the terms of issuance. The maturity event triggers redemption of the securities, and the suspension simply reflects the end of the trading life cycle for these instruments.

**Operational Impact**: None. Standard procedure for NCD lifecycle management.
