## Summary

NSE has announced the inclusion of 4 securities under Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I framework and the exclusion of 6 securities from the ASM framework, both effective December 19, 2025. The included securities will face increased margin requirements starting December 22, 2025. This circular is issued by the Surveillance Department and follows previous ASM-related circulars dating back to October 2018.

## Key Points

- 4 securities included in ST-ASM Stage I: Aatmaj Healthcare Limited, Amines & Plasticizers Limited, Meesho Limited, and Sameera Agro And Infra Limited
- Margin requirement increased to 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at maximum 100%
- Margin increase applies to all open positions as on December 19, 2025 and new positions from December 22, 2025
- 6 securities excluded from ASM framework: Auri Grow India Limited, Mangalam Drugs And Organics Limited, Marinetrans India Limited, Neelam Linens and Garments (India) Limited, Pranik Logistics Limited, and S A Tech Software India Limited
- No securities moved between ST-ASM Stage I and Stage II
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements surveillance measures under the ST-ASM framework as per previous circulars (NSE/SURV/39265, NSE/SURV/46557, NSE/SURV/52144, NSE/SURV/58558, and NSE/SURV/64066). The margin requirements represent a significant increase for the affected securities to curb excessive speculation and volatility.

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must apply minimum 50% margin (or existing margin, whichever is higher) on affected securities
- Margin requirements apply to both existing open positions and new positions
- Members should monitor the ASM framework status of securities regularly
- For queries, members may contact surveillance@nse.co.in
