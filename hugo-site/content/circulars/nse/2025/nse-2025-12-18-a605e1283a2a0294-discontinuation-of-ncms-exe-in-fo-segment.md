title: Discontinuation of NCMS EXE in F&O Segment
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has announced the discontinuation of NCMS EXE and NCMS API version 1.6 for the Futures & Options segment. All clearing members must migrate to NCMS API 2.0 facility, which is now available in the live environment. Members need to register by providing specific details to msd_clearing@nsccl.co.in to access the new API facility.

## Key Points

- NCMS API 2.0 facility is now available in live environment for F&O segment
- API provides facilities for Trade & Action download/inquiry, confirmation, rejection, and modification
- Members must submit registration details including Primary Member Code, Member Name, Email ID, Contact Number, and IP Address(es)
- Multiple IP addresses can be registered per member
- NCMS EXE will be decommissioned on April 06, 2026
- NCMS API version 1.6 will be decommissioned on February 23, 2026

## Regulatory Changes

This circular mandates a technology infrastructure upgrade for all clearing members in the F&O segment. The existing NCMS EXE application and older API version 1.6 are being phased out in favor of the more advanced NCMS API 2.0 platform.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must send registration email to msd_clearing@nsccl.co.in with the following details:
  - Primary Member Code
  - Member Name
  - Email ID (Group ID preferred)
  - Contact Number
  - IP Address(es) from which API requests will be sent
- Members are required to extensively test the NCMS API 2.0 in their environment
- Ensure smooth transition from NCMS EXE to NCMS API 2.0 before the decommissioning deadlines

## Important Dates

- **December 18, 2025**: Circular issued, NCMS API 2.0 available in live environment
- **February 23, 2026**: NCMS API version 1.6 to be decommissioned
- **April 06, 2026**: NCMS EXE to be decommissioned

## Impact Assessment

This technology upgrade has high operational impact on all clearing members in the F&O segment. Members must allocate resources for:

- Testing and integration of NCMS API 2.0 into their existing systems
- Training staff on the new API facility
- Ensuring business continuity during the migration period
- Updating internal systems and workflows to accommodate the new API structure

Failure to migrate before the decommissioning deadlines could result in disruption of clearing operations for F&O trades. Members have approximately 2-4 months to complete testing and migration depending on which system they are currently using.
