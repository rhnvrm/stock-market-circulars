title: Temporary discontinuation of NSE goBID mobile application
---

## Summary

NSE has announced the temporary discontinuation of the NSE goBID mobile application effective end of day July 30, 2025. The mobile app facilitated retail investor participation in non-competitive bidding for government securities, treasury bills, state development loans, and debt IPOs. The web-based platform will continue to operate normally.

## Key Points

- NSE goBID mobile app (Android 4.4+) will be temporarily discontinued from EOD July 30, 2025
- Web platform remains accessible at https://eipo.nseindia.com/eipodc/rest/login
- Platform enables non-competitive bidding in G-Secs, T-Bills, SDL, and Debt IPOs
- Originally launched in November 2018 following RBI permission for stock exchanges to act as aggregators
- SDL facility added in November 2019, Debt IPO facility added in January 2021

## Regulatory Changes

Partial modification of previous NSE circulars (NSE/IPO/39424, NSE/IPO/42666, NSE/IPO/46907) regarding platform access methods.

## Compliance Requirements

- Participants must transition to web-based platform for NCB and Debt IPO transactions
- All existing mobile app users need to migrate to web platform
- Participants should inform clients about the change in access method

## Important Dates

- **July 30, 2025 (EOD)**: NSE goBID mobile application discontinuation effective date
- Duration: Until further notice

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on retail investors who relied on mobile app convenience for government securities investment. However, full functionality remains available through web platform, ensuring continued market access for non-competitive bidding in government securities and debt IPOs.
