## Impact Assessment

This is a routine NFO launch with minimal market impact. It provides investors an opportunity to gain exposure to silver through an ETF Fund of Fund structure. The launch expands the product offerings on the NSE MF Invest Platform but does not affect existing trading operations or require significant operational changes from members. Impact is limited to mutual fund distribution participants.
