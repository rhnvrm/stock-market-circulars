## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this involves routine listing of additional shares for two SME companies. The issuance sizes are relatively small (66,900 and 33,078 shares respectively). CPS shares have a 7-month lock-in period until June 2026, while DUGLOBAL shares have no lock-in restrictions. This primarily affects existing shareholders and investors specifically tracking these SME stocks.
