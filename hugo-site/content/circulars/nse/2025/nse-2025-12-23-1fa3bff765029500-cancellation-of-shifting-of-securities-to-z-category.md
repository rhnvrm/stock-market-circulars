title: Cancellation of shifting of securities to Z Category
---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange has decided to cancel the shifting of Viji Finance Limited (Symbol: VIJIFIN) to Z Category (BZ Category) that was scheduled to take effect from December 26, 2025. This action reverses the earlier decision communicated via Circular No. NSE/CML/71805 dated December 15, 2025, which had announced the shift due to non-compliance with Regulation 31 of SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015.

## Key Points

- Cancellation applies to Viji Finance Limited (Symbol: VIJIFIN)
- Original shifting was scheduled for December 26, 2025
- Non-compliance related to Regulation 31 - submission of shareholding pattern
- Company had failed to submit shareholding pattern for two consecutive quarters (June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025)
- Exchange has decided not to proceed with the Z Category classification

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular cancels a previously announced enforcement action.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. The circular provides relief from the previously announced Z Category shifting for Viji Finance Limited.

## Important Dates

- **December 15, 2025**: Original circular (NSE/CML/71805) announced shifting to Z Category
- **December 23, 2025**: Current circular issued canceling the shifting
- **December 26, 2025**: Date when shifting was originally scheduled to take effect (now cancelled)

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact for Viji Finance Limited**: The cancellation of Z Category shifting allows VIJIFIN to continue trading in its current category, avoiding the restricted trading conditions and negative perception associated with Z Category classification.

**Market Impact**: Minimal broader market impact as this affects only one security. The reversal suggests the company may have achieved compliance or provided satisfactory explanation to the exchange regarding the shareholding pattern submissions for Q2 and Q3 2025.
