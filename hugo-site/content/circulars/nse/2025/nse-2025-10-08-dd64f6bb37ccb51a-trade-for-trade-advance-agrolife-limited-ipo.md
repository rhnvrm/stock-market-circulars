## Regulatory Changes

The security will transition from trade-for-trade settlement mechanism to normal rolling settlement (T+1), removing trading restrictions typically imposed on newly listed securities or those with surveillance concerns.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 08, 2025
