## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - MFSS participants need to plan settlement operations around 19 weekday holidays. The distribution of holidays throughout the year, with clusters in March-April and October-November, may require careful liquidity and operational planning.

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine annual notification that allows market participants to plan ahead for mutual fund settlement operations.

**Planning Considerations**: Participants should note the concentration of holidays in certain months (4 holidays in March, 3 in April, 3 in October, 3 in November) which may affect settlement cycles and fund availability during these periods.
