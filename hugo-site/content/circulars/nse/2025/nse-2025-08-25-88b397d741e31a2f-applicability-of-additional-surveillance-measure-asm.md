title: Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - Long Term Framework Implementation
---

## Summary

NSE has implemented Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework for selected securities, imposing 100% margin requirements and potential segment shifts from rolling settlement to trade-for-trade basis effective August 29, 2025.

## Key Points

- Three securities added to Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I: Lotus Eye Hospital, Trident Techlabs, and Tembo Global Industries
- 100% margin requirement applicable on all open and new positions from August 29, 2025
- Securities under criteria VII will shift from EQ series to BE series (trade-for-trade)
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance, not adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of Long-Term ASM framework with staged approach
- Margin requirements increased to 100% for affected securities
- Segment classification changes for qualifying securities from rolling settlement to trade-for-trade

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with 100% margin requirements for affected securities
- Trading members need to adjust systems for segment changes
- Compliance with all prevailing surveillance measures remains mandatory

## Important Dates

- **August 26, 2025**: ASM framework takes effect for listed securities
- **August 28, 2025**: Last day before margin requirements apply to existing positions
- **August 29, 2025**: 100% margin requirement becomes effective for all positions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - 100% margin requirements will significantly reduce liquidity and trading volumes in affected securities. The trade-for-trade segment shift will further restrict trading flexibility.

**Operational Impact**: High - Trading members must adjust risk management systems, margin calculations, and client communications. Position management becomes more capital-intensive for affected securities.
