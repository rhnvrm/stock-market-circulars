## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects only Infosys shareholders and trading members participating in the buyback offer.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure proper coordination for early pay-in of demat shares and timely funds settlement. The 7-day trading window provides adequate time for participants to tender shares. Any delays in RTA acceptance details or funds pay-in could result in revised settlement schedules, requiring operational flexibility.

**Investor Impact:** Infosys shareholders wishing to participate in the buyback must work through their brokers to tender shares via early pay-in mechanism before the November 26 deadline. The detailed rejection code list (26 reasons) helps participants understand potential issues that could lead to order rejection or partial acceptance.
