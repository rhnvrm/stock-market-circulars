## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has published the settlement schedule for the Futures & Options (F&O) segment for December 2025. The circular provides the complete calendar of trade dates and their corresponding settlement dates for all 22 trading days in December 2025, enabling members to plan their clearing and settlement operations.

## Key Points

- Settlement schedule covers December 1-31, 2025
- 22 trading days with T+1 settlement cycle
- Last trading day of 2025 (December 31) settles on January 1, 2026
- Market closed on December 25, 2025
- Circular reference number: NCL/CMPT/71133 (Circular 142/2025)
- Applicable to all F&O segment members

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational schedule announcement.

## Compliance Requirements

- F&O members must note the settlement dates for operational planning
- Members should ensure adequate margin and collateral arrangements as per the schedule
- Settlement obligations must be met on specified settlement dates
- Members should plan for year-end settlement spanning into 2026

## Important Dates

**December 2025 Trading Calendar:**
- First trading day: December 1, 2025 (settles December 2)
- Holiday: December 25, 2025 (no trading)
- Last trading day: December 31, 2025 (settles January 1, 2026)
- Year-end transition: December 31 trades settle in 2026

**Complete Schedule:** 22 trading days with consecutive T+1 settlements from December 2, 2025 through January 1, 2026.

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Members need to plan clearing operations around the year-end transition and ensure adequate staffing and systems readiness for the December 31 to January 1 settlement.

**Market Impact:** Low - Routine schedule announcement with no changes to settlement processes or timelines.

**Planning Considerations:** The year-end settlement spanning into 2026 requires coordination between clearing members for fund transfers and reconciliation across calendar years. The December 25 holiday creates a longer gap between December 24 and 26 trading sessions.
