## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Limited market impact as no new securities added to ESM Stage I
- Three securities (NORBTEAEXP, PATTECH, TANKUP) experience relaxed surveillance moving from Stage II to Stage I, though still subject to ESM restrictions
- AGSTRA exits ESM framework entirely, returning to normal trading conditions
- Price band for excluded securities reinstated to pre-ESM levels (subject to other surveillance measures)

**Trading Impact:**
- ESM securities continue to operate under Trade-for-Trade settlement, limiting intraday liquidity
- 100% margin requirement increases capital requirements for positions in ESM securities
- Stage II securities face additional 2% price band restriction under Periodic Call Auction mechanism

**Compliance Impact:**
- Routine surveillance update with no major procedural changes
- Members must monitor consolidated ESM list (Annexure III) for ongoing compliance
- ESM designation is surveillance-based and not an adverse action against companies
