title: Applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework, placing one new security under Stage I surveillance, moving two securities from Stage I to Stage II, and removing six securities from the ASM framework entirely. The changes take effect November 26, 2025, with margin requirements applicable from November 27, 2025.

## Key Points

- Jet Freight Logistics Limited (JETFREIGHT) added to ST-ASM Stage I
- Margin requirement: 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at 100%
- Giriraj Civil Developers Limited (GIRIRAJ) and Nirman Agri Genetics Limited (NIRMAN) escalated from Stage I to Stage II
- Six securities excluded from ASM: ARSSBL, ENFUSE, MEDISTEP, MRIL, SATECH, and VCL
- ENFUSE moved from ST-ASM to LT-ASM (Long-Term ASM) framework
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other existing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements changes to the ST-ASM framework established under previous circulars (NSE/SURV/39265, NSE/SURV/46557, NSE/SURV/52144, NSE/SURV/58558, and NSE/SURV/64066). The framework applies heightened surveillance and margin requirements to securities meeting specific criteria for unusual trading patterns or price movements.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Apply 50% margin (or existing margin if higher) on all positions in JETFREIGHT, capped at maximum 100%
- Margin applies to: (1) all open positions as on November 26, 2025, and (2) new positions created from November 27, 2025
- Continue enhanced surveillance on securities in Stage II (GIRIRAJ and NIRMAN)
- Remove ASM restrictions on the six excluded securities (ARSSBL, ENFUSE, MEDISTEP, MRIL, SATECH, VCL)

**For Investors:**
- Be aware of increased margin requirements for trading in affected securities
- Expect higher capital requirements for positions in ST-ASM securities

## Important Dates

- **November 25, 2025**: Circular issued
- **November 26, 2025**: ST-ASM classification changes take effect
- **November 27, 2025**: Margin requirements applicable on all open positions and new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Trading liquidity may decrease in JETFREIGHT due to higher margin requirements
- Investors holding positions in affected securities will need additional capital to maintain positions
- Stage II escalation for GIRIRAJ and NIRMAN signals continued surveillance concerns
- Exclusion of six securities from ASM provides relief and may improve trading activity

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers must update margin systems to reflect new requirements by November 27, 2025
- Risk management systems need reconfiguration for affected securities
- Client communication required for position holders in JETFREIGHT regarding increased margins

**Securities Affected:**
- **New to ST-ASM Stage I:** Jet Freight Logistics Limited (INE982V01025)
- **Escalated to Stage II:** Giriraj Civil Developers Limited (INE614Z01017), Nirman Agri Genetics Limited (INE0OK701014)
- **Excluded from ASM:** Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers Limited (INE549H01021), Enfuse Solutions Limited (INE0S3X01014), Medistep Healthcare Limited (INE0UOY01019), Mahendra Realtors & Infrastructure Limited (INE632Q01018), S A Tech Software India Limited (INE0BSN01013), Vaxtex Cotfab Limited (INE098201036)
