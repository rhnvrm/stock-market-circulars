title: Adherence to TRAI Direction dated November 19, 2025 - Mandatory Phase-wise
  Adoption of 1600-Series Numbers
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued a circular informing all Clearing/Self Clearing/Professional Clearing Members about the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Direction dated November 19, 2025. The direction mandates phase-wise adoption of 1600-series numbers for all service and transactional voice calls made by entities regulated by RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA. Members must ensure strict and timely compliance with the adoption timelines and operational conditions.

## Key Points

- TRAI has issued a Direction under section 13, read with sub-clauses (i) and (v) of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 11 of the TRAI Act, 1997
- Mandatory phase-wise adoption of 1600-series numbers for service and transactional voice calls
- Applies to all entities regulated by RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA
- All NSE Clearing/Self Clearing/Professional Clearing Members must comply
- TRAI Press Release No. 135 dated November 19, 2025 accompanies the directive
- Members must adhere to specified adoption timelines and operational conditions

## Regulatory Changes

TRAI has invoked its regulatory powers under the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997 to mandate the use of 1600-series numbers for commercial communications. This builds upon the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018 (6 of 2018) dated July 19, 2018, which were designed to curb unsolicited commercial communications. The new direction specifically targets financial sector entities regulated by RBI, SEBI, and PFRDA, requiring them to use designated number series for service and transactional voice calls.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE Clearing Members, Self Clearing Members, and Professional Clearing Members must adopt 1600-series numbers for service and transactional voice calls
- Compliance must follow the phase-wise timelines specified in the TRAI Direction dated November 19, 2025
- Members must ensure all commercial communications using telecom networks use registered headers or number resources from special series assigned for commercial communication
- Entities not registered with Access Providers for sending commercial communications are prohibited from making such communications
- Failure to comply may result in suspension or disconnection of telecom resources
- Members should refer to the attached TRAI directive and Press Release No. 135 for detailed operational conditions

## Important Dates

- TRAI Direction issued: November 19, 2025
- NSE Clearing circular issued: November 24, 2025
- Specific phase-wise adoption timelines: Referenced in attached TRAI Direction (detailed timelines to be reviewed in the complete directive document)

## Impact Assessment

This directive will require all SEBI-regulated entities, including NSE clearing members, to transition their customer service and transactional voice call systems to use 1600-series numbers. The impact is operational in nature, requiring:

- Technical infrastructure changes to implement new numbering systems
- Registration with Access Providers for the 1600-series numbers
- Potential updates to customer communications about new contact numbers
- Staff training on new calling procedures
- Compliance monitoring systems to ensure adherence to timelines

The medium impact classification reflects that while this is mandatory and affects operational processes, it primarily concerns telecommunication infrastructure rather than core trading or settlement activities. However, the high importance ranking reflects the mandatory nature and potential penalties for non-compliance, including possible suspension or disconnection of telecom resources.
