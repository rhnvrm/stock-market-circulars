## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Members and custodians trading TATAINVEST must implement specific early pay-in procedures for a brief period, requiring operational adjustments to handle dual ISIN transition and conversion ratio calculations.

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium - Limited to single stock but affects all market participants holding or trading TATAINVEST around the corporate action dates. Proper execution ensures smooth settlement and margin benefit delivery.

**Client Impact:** Members must ensure client demat accounts have proper blocking mechanisms in place and custodians must accurately allocate early pay-in across client accounts using correct quantities and ISINs to avoid settlement failures.
