title: Revised Settlement Calendar for Takeover Offer under Tender Offer Scheme of
  VIP Industries Limited
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued a revised settlement calendar for the takeover offer under tender offer scheme of VIP Industries Limited. This circular modifies the settlement schedule previously communicated in circular NCL/CMPT/71027 dated October 30, 2025, specifically updating the obligation download and settlement dates while keeping the trade period unchanged.

## Key Points

- Settlement Type: X, Settlement No: 2025115
- Trade period remains: November 3, 2025 to November 17, 2025
- Obligation Download dates revised to: November 19, 2025 to November 20, 2025
- Settlement may be further revised if there are delays in receiving acceptance details from RTA or funds pay-in by buying trading members
- All other details from the original circular dated October 30, 2025 continue to apply
- Circular reference: NCL/CMPT/71339, Circular No: 0367/2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is an operational update to a previously announced tender offer settlement schedule.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members, custodians, and PCMs must note the revised settlement calendar
- Trading members must ensure timely funds pay-in to avoid further settlement delays
- Participants should monitor for potential additional revisions based on RTA acceptance details or payment timing

## Important Dates

- **Trade Start Date**: November 3, 2025
- **Trade End Date**: November 17, 2025
- **Obligation Download**: November 19-20, 2025 (revised)
- **Settlement Date**: November 20, 2025 (subject to change)

## Impact Assessment

This revision affects all market participants involved in the VIP Industries takeover offer. The extension of obligation download dates provides additional time for processing, which may benefit members dealing with acceptance details from the Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA). Trading members must adjust their operational timelines accordingly. The disclaimer about potential further revisions based on RTA acceptance details or funds pay-in delays introduces some uncertainty into the settlement process.
