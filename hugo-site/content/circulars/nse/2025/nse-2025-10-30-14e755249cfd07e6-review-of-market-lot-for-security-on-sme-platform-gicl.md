---

## Summary

NSE has revised the market lot for GLOBE INTL CARRIERS LTD (GICL) trading on the SME platform from 6000 shares to 3000 shares, effective October 31, 2025. This is a partial modification to the earlier circular NSE/CMTR/70552 dated September 30, 2025, and follows the previous adjustment made via circular NSE/CMTR/70599 dated October 03, 2025 which had increased the lot size from 1500 to 6000 shares.

## Key Points

- Market lot for GICL revised from 6000 to 3000 shares
- Effective date: October 31, 2025
- Partial modification to circular NSE/CMTR/70552 dated September 30, 2025
- Previous market lot history: 1500 → 6000 (Oct 15, 2025) → 3000 (Oct 31, 2025)
- Members must load updated security files before trading on the effective date

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements standardized lot size provisions under SEBI circular no CIR/MRD/DSA/06/2012 dated February 21, 2012, which governs standardized lot sizes for SME Exchange/Platform securities. The revision brings the market lot to 3000 shares from the previously revised 6000 shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must load updated security.gz/nnf_security.gz/MII - Security File.gz files in their trading applications before October 31, 2025
- Files are available from the directory common/NTNEAT on the Extranet server
- MII - Security File.gz is also accessible on NSE website at https://www.nseindia.com/all-reports

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 30, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 31, 2025
- **Previous Revision**: October 15, 2025 (market lot changed from 1500 to 6000)

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to traders and investors of GLOBE INTL CARRIERS LTD on the SME platform. The reduction in market lot from 6000 to 3000 shares will:

- Lower the minimum investment required per transaction
- Improve accessibility for retail investors
- Enhance liquidity by allowing smaller order sizes
- Require system updates by trading members before the effective date

The change affects only one security and has minimal broader market impact.
