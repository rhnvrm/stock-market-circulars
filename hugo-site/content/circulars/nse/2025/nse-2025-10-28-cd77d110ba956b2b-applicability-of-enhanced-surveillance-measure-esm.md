title: Applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - October 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has issued updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective October 29-30, 2025. Three securities (MOXSH, PENTAGON, SPRL) are being added to ESM Stage-I with 100% margin requirements and shift to Trade-for-Trade segment. One security (PVP) is moving from Stage-I to Stage-II with additional restrictions including 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction. No securities are being excluded from the framework.

## Key Points

- Three securities added to ESM Stage-I: Moxsh Overseas Educon Limited, Pentagon Rubber Limited, and Sp Refractories Limited
- PVP Ventures Limited moving from ESM Stage-I to Stage-II with stricter surveillance
- Minimum 100% margin applicable on all open and new positions for Stage-I securities
- Securities shifting from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST)
- Stage-II securities subject to Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework in this update
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

Securities qualifying under ESM will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST) effective October 30, 2025. Securities moving to Stage-II will additionally be placed under Trade-for-Trade with a 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction mechanism effective October 29, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must ensure 100% margin is maintained on all open positions as on October 29, 2025
- 100% margin required on all new positions created from October 30, 2025 for listed securities
- Trading members must comply with Trade-for-Trade settlement requirements for affected securities
- Stage-II securities must be traded within 2% price band restrictions under Periodic Call Auction
- Members should refer to consolidated list in Annexure III for complete ESM framework coverage

## Important Dates

- **October 28, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 29, 2025**: Stage-II securities come under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction; 100% margin applicable on open positions
- **October 30, 2025**: Stage-I securities shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST segment; 100% margin on new positions begins

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities moving to Trade-for-Trade segment will experience reduced liquidity as intraday trading is not permitted. The 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for market participants holding positions in these securities.

**Price Impact**: PVP Ventures Limited will be subject to 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction in Stage-II, which will restrict price movements and potentially impact price discovery.

**Operational Impact**: Market participants with existing positions in MOXSH, PENTAGON, SPRL, and PVP must ensure adequate margin coverage and adjust trading strategies to accommodate Trade-for-Trade settlement requirements.

**Market Segment**: This surveillance action affects four securities across different sectors and is implemented purely for market surveillance purposes, not as adverse action against the companies.
