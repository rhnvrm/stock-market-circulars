## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This listing adds a new trading opportunity for investors in the manufacturing/international trade sector. The substantial lock-in percentages (approximately 86.9% of total shares locked for various periods) indicate significant promoter/anchor investor commitment and will limit immediate free float availability.

**Investor Impact**: The Rs. 384 issue price with Rs. 5 face value represents a premium of 7,580% over face value, typical for IPO pricing. Investors should note the staggered lock-in release schedule which will affect liquidity and potential supply over the next three years.

**Trading Impact**: Market lot of 1 share provides high accessibility for retail investors. Pre-open session participation ensures price discovery mechanism for the first trading day.
