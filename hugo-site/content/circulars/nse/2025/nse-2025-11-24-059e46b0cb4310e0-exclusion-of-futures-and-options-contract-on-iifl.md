## Summary

National Stock Exchange of India has announced the exclusion of Futures and Options contracts on IIFL Finance Limited. No new expiry month contracts will be issued after the existing contracts expire. This action is taken in reference to SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-2/P/CIR/2024/116 dated August 30, 2024 regarding eligibility criteria of stocks for derivatives trading.

## Key Points

- IIFL Finance Limited (Symbol: IIFL) will not have new F&O contract months issued
- Existing unexpired contracts for November 2025, December 2025, and January 2026 will continue trading
- New strikes will continue to be introduced in existing contract months until expiry
- Complete cessation of all F&O contracts effective January 28, 2026
- Decision based on SEBI eligibility criteria for stock derivatives

## Regulatory Changes

This exclusion follows SEBI's revised eligibility criteria for stocks in the derivatives segment as outlined in SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-2/P/CIR/2024/116 dated August 30, 2024. IIFL Finance Limited no longer meets the criteria required for continuation of derivatives contracts.

## Compliance Requirements

- **December 2025**: Existing contract month (expiry continues)
- **January 2026**: Final existing contract month
- **January 28, 2026**: Complete exclusion effective date - no F&O contracts will be available for trading

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - This is a complete exclusion of derivatives trading for IIFL Finance Limited, affecting all traders and investors using F&O instruments for hedging or speculation on this stock.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to actively manage client positions and expectations. Clients with long-term strategies involving IIFL derivatives will need to restructure their positions.

**Liquidity Impact**: Expected reduction in derivatives liquidity for IIFL as the expiry dates approach, with potential impact on bid-ask spreads and price discovery in existing contracts.

**Risk Management**: Members and clients must reassess risk management strategies that relied on IIFL derivatives for hedging equity positions in the underlying stock.
