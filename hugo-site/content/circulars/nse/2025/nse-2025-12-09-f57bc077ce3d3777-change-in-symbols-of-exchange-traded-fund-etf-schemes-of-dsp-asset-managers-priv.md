---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has announced changes to the trading symbols of four Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) schemes managed by DSP Asset Managers Private Limited. The new symbols will become effective from December 15, 2025. This is an administrative change that affects how these ETFs are identified on the trading platform.

## Key Points

- Four DSP ETF schemes will have their trading symbols changed
- DSP Nifty Bank ETF: BANKETFADD → BANKADD
- DSP NIFTY IT ETF: ITETFADD → ITADD
- DSP GOLD ETF: GOLDETFADD → GOLDADD
- DSP Nifty 50 ETF: NIFTY50ADD → NIFTYADD
- ISIN codes remain unchanged for all schemes
- Changes are effective from December 15, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an administrative update to standardize or simplify ETF trading symbols on the NSE platform.

## Compliance Requirements

- Exchange members must update their systems to recognize the new symbols from December 15, 2025
- Market participants should be aware of the symbol changes when placing orders for these ETF schemes
- DSP Asset Managers Private Limited and intermediaries should communicate these changes to investors

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: December 09, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 15, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is purely an administrative change affecting trading symbols only. The ISIN codes, which are the primary identifiers for securities, remain unchanged.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Market participants and trading systems will need to update symbol references, but no fundamental changes to the ETF schemes themselves. Investors holding these ETFs are not required to take any action as the underlying securities remain the same.
