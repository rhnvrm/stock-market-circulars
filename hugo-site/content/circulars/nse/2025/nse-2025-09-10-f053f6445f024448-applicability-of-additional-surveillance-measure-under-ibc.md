title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure under IBC
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a surveillance circular regarding the applicability of Additional Surveillance Measures (ASM) for companies under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The circular announces that one security, Atmastco Limited, will be excluded from ASM IBC effective September 11, 2025, while maintaining the consolidated list of other securities under surveillance.

## Key Points

- Atmastco Limited (ATMASTCO, ISIN: INE05DH01017) to be excluded from ASM IBC framework
- No new securities added to ASM IBC in any stage
- ASM IBC framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting under ASM IBC is purely for market surveillance and not adverse action against companies
- Consolidated ASM IBC list includes 4+ securities across different stages

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. The circular maintains the existing ASM IBC framework established through previous circulars from 2018, 2022, 2023, and September 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the exclusion of Atmastco Limited from ASM IBC
- Members should be aware that ASM IBC works alongside other surveillance measures
- Companies under ASM IBC remain subject to enhanced monitoring requirements

## Important Dates

- **September 11, 2025**: Effective date for exclusion of Atmastco Limited from ASM IBC
- **September 10, 2025**: Circular issue date

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as only one security is being excluded from surveillance measures. The exclusion of Atmastco Limited from ASM IBC suggests improved compliance or resolution of issues that led to its initial inclusion. Other securities remain under surveillance, maintaining market integrity measures for companies with insolvency-related concerns.
