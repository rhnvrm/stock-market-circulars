## Summary

NSE has issued the quarterly review update for securities under the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. The GSM is an additional surveillance measure applicable to securities whose prices are not commensurate with financial health and fundamentals including earnings, book value, fixed assets, net worth, market capitalization, and P/E multiples. The circular identifies securities being newly placed under GSM, those continuing in GSM, and those moving out of the framework.

## Key Points

- Quarterly review of GSM framework completed for identification of securities
- New securities identified for placing in GSM framework (Annexure I) with applicable action and monitoring dates
- Existing securities to continue in GSM framework (Annexure II)
- Some securities to move out of GSM framework effective December 09, 2025 (Annexure III)
- At least 13 securities newly shortlisted including ANSALAPI, ARSHIYA, BLUECOAST, CELEBRITY, MARSHALL, MORARJEE, PERFECT, REGENCERAM, SADBHAV, SADBHIN, SANWARIA, SECURKLOUD, and SKIL
- Securities placed based on Criteria 1 (price vs fundamentals) and/or Criteria 2
- GSM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Securities in GSM Stage VI based on SEBI directive continue to remain until further directions
- Trading members advised to exercise additional due diligence

## Important Dates

- **December 05, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **December 09, 2025**: Securities in Annexure III move out of GSM framework
- **December 15, 2025**: New securities in Annexure I placed in GSM framework (effective date)
- **December 15, 2025**: Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) released for securities moving out of GSM (Annexure III)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities under GSM face enhanced surveillance including potential Additional Surveillance Deposit requirements, price bands, and trading restrictions. This affects liquidity and trading patterns for the identified securities.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in the 13+ newly identified securities face higher transaction costs due to ASD requirements and should be aware of the price-fundamental mismatch concerns raised by the exchange.

**Market Participants**: Brokers and trading members must implement additional due diligence processes for GSM securities, affecting operational workflows and client communication requirements.

**Risk Mitigation**: The GSM framework aims to protect investors by highlighting securities where prices may not reflect underlying fundamentals, helping prevent speculative excesses and market manipulation.
