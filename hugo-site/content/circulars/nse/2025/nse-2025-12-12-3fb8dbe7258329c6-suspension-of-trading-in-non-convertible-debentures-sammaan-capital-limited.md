## Impact Assessment

The impact of this circular is minimal and limited to existing holders of these specific NCD series. This is a standard administrative procedure for matured debt instruments. The suspension does not indicate any financial distress or regulatory action against Sammaan Capital Limited - it is simply the natural conclusion of the debt instruments' lifecycle. Trading members and investors holding these NCDs should arrange for redemption through the issuer's designated processes. There is no broader market impact expected from this routine suspension.
