## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This preferential issue represents a significant expansion of IndiGrid's unit capital. The one-year lock-in period suggests participation by strategic or institutional investors, which may be viewed positively for long-term stability. However, existing unitholders will experience dilution.

**Liquidity Impact**: The addition of 25.98 million units will increase the total outstanding units, potentially improving trading liquidity post lock-in expiry.

**Investor Considerations**: The issue price of Rs. 168.77 per unit provides a reference point for valuation. Investors should note that these units are pari passu with existing units, carrying equal rights and privileges. The lock-in period prevents immediate selling pressure from allottees.
