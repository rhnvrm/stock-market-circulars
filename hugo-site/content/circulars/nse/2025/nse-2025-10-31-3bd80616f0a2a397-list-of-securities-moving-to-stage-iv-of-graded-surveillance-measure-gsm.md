## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the most severe stage of the Graded Surveillance Measure framework, building upon previous circulars NSE/SURV/34262 (February 23, 2017), NSE/SURV/38389 (July 20, 2018), NSE/SURV/42790 (November 29, 2019), NSE/SURV/59425 (November 17, 2023), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), and NSE/SURV/70168 (September 12, 2025).

**GSM Framework Stages:**

- **Stage I**: 100% margin rate and 5% or lower price band
- **Stage II**: Trade-for-trade with 5% price band and 50% ASD by buyers
- **Stage III**: Trade-for-trade with 5% price band, weekly trading only (Monday/1st trading day), and 100% ASD
- **Stage IV**: All Stage III restrictions plus no upward price movement allowed

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must take adequate precautions when trading in YAARI shares
- **Buyers**: Must deposit 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) of trade value before purchasing
- **Settlement**: Mandatory trade-to-trade basis with no netting off permitted
- **Trading Schedule**: Trading only on Mondays or the first trading day of each week
- **Price Restrictions**: Must adhere to 5% or lower price band with no upward movement
- **Queries**: Members should contact surveillance@nse.co.in for further clarification

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: October 31, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 03, 2025
- **Trading Frequency**: Once per week (every Monday or 1st trading day)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Stage IV GSM represents the most severe surveillance action, indicating serious concerns about the security. The restriction to weekly trading combined with no upward price movement effectively freezes price appreciation and severely constrains liquidity.

**Liquidity Impact**: The combination of trade-for-trade settlement, 100% ASD requirement, and once-weekly trading will drastically reduce trading volumes and liquidity in YAARI shares.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders face significantly limited exit opportunities with only weekly trading windows and no possibility of price appreciation. New buyers must commit substantial capital (100% ASD) with high risk and limited liquidity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must implement strict controls and adequately warn clients about the extreme restrictions on this security. The no-netting-off requirement increases settlement risks and capital requirements.
