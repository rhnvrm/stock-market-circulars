title: Adjustment in Cross Margin Weightages on Account of Demerger in HINDUNILVR
  Limited
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued instructions regarding adjustments to cross margin weightages due to the demerger of Hindustan Unilever Limited (HINDUNILVR). The circular outlines a phased approach where HINDUNILVR will be temporarily excluded from cross margin computation, followed by reinstatement with revised weightages based on post-demerger pricing. Additionally, spread margins for NIFTY Index portfolios will be temporarily increased from 25% to 30% during the transition period.

## Key Points

- HINDUNILVR to be excluded from cross margin computation from December 4, 2025 end of day
- Weightages for other index constituents remain unchanged during exclusion period
- Revised weightages will be published based on HINDUNILVR closing price on December 5, 2025
- New weightages become effective from December 9, 2025 begin day
- Spread margins for NIFTY Index portfolios increased from 25% to 30% during transition
- Members must sync portfolios per revised weightages by December 8, 2025 end of day
- This follows earlier circulars NSE/FAOP/71509 (Nov 27, 2025) and NCL/CMPT/71549 (Nov 28, 2025)

## Regulatory Changes

Temporary modification to cross margin computation methodology to accommodate corporate action. The spread margin increase from 25% to 30% for NIFTY Index portfolios represents a temporary risk adjustment during the demerger transition period.

## Compliance Requirements

**For All Members:**
- Sync portfolios according to revised weightages by December 8, 2025 end of day
- Ensure systems accommodate temporary exclusion of HINDUNILVR from cross margin calculations
- Prepare for revised weightage implementation from December 9, 2025 begin day
- Account for increased spread margins (30% vs 25%) for NIFTY Index positions during December 4-8, 2025

## Important Dates

- **December 3, 2025**: Circular issued
- **December 4, 2025 (end of day)**: HINDUNILVR excluded from cross margin computation; spread margin increased to 30%
- **December 5, 2025**: Closing price of HINDUNILVR used to calculate revised weightages
- **December 8, 2025 (end of day)**: Deadline for members to sync portfolios per revised weightages; last day of 30% spread margin
- **December 9, 2025 (begin day)**: Revised weightages become effective

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - affects all participants with NIFTY Index derivatives positions and cross-margin portfolios containing HINDUNILVR. The temporary exclusion creates a 5-day window where cross margin benefits related to HINDUNILVR positions will not be available.

**Operational Impact:** High - members must update their risk management systems twice (once for exclusion, once for revised weightages) within a short timeframe. The 20% increase in spread margins (from 25% to 30%) will temporarily increase margin requirements for NIFTY Index portfolios, potentially affecting liquidity and position management.

**Risk Management:** The increased spread margin serves as a prudent measure to account for heightened uncertainty during the demerger process. Members should ensure adequate collateral availability during the transition period.
