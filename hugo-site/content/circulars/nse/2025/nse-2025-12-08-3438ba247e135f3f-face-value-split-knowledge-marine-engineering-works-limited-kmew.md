## Compliance Requirements

- All members and market participants must update their systems to reflect the new face value from December 22, 2025

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 22, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**For Shareholders**: Existing shareholders will receive twice the number of shares at half the face value. The total value of their holding remains unchanged, but increased liquidity may result from lower per-share price.

**For Trading**: The stock price will be adjusted proportionally (approximately halved) on the effective date. Increased affordability per share may attract retail investors and improve trading volumes.
