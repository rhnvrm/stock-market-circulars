  Reduction

## Summary

NSE has issued a modification to its earlier circular dated December 19, 2025 regarding the recommencement of trading in equity shares of Neueon Corporation Limited (formerly Neueon Towers Limited). The modification clarifies that the stock will remain in Series 'BE' and continue in the Trade-for-Trade segment, rather than being shifted to Series 'EQ' as previously indicated. This follows capital reduction pursuant to a Resolution Plan approved by the Hon'ble NCLT on October 23, 2024.

## Key Points

- Modification to NSE Circular Ref. No. NSE/CML/71917 dated December 19, 2025
- All details remain unchanged except for trading series remarks
- Securities available for trading in Series 'BE' only
- Stock continues in Trade-for-Trade segment as per Exchange notice NSE/SURV/55582 dated February 10, 2023
- Previous indication of shift to Series 'EQ' is now cancelled
- Capital reduction implemented pursuant to NCLT Resolution Plan approved October 23, 2024
- Company formerly known as Neueon Towers Limited

## Regulatory Changes

The modification updates the trading series classification:

**Previous Statement (Now Cancelled):**
"Currently the securities shall be available for trading in Series 'BE' and subsequently be shifted to Series 'EQ' as per SEBI circular no. CIR/MRD/DP/01/2012 & CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012"

**New Statement:**
"Currently the securities shall be available for trading in Series 'BE'. Also, the Trading in the scrip continue to remain in Trade-for-Trade segment pursuant to Exchange notice no NSE/SURV/55582 dated February 10, 2023"

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note that Neueon Corporation Limited will remain in Series 'BE'
- Trade-for-Trade settlement continues to apply
- No intraday trading or squaring off positions allowed
- All trades must result in delivery

## Important Dates

- **October 23, 2024:** NCLT order approving Resolution Plan
- **December 19, 2025:** Original circular issued (NSE/CML/71917)
- **December 23, 2025:** Modified circular issued
- **February 10, 2023:** Original Exchange notice implementing Trade-for-Trade segment

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a clarification/modification affecting a single stock already under surveillance measures.

**Trading Impact:** Stock remains under restrictive Trade-for-Trade segment with no change to current trading conditions. Investors cannot take intraday positions and must take/give delivery.

**Investor Impact:** No immediate action required. Existing shareholders and potential investors should be aware that enhanced surveillance measures continue to apply, requiring delivery-based settlement only.

**Regulatory Context:** The continuation in Trade-for-Trade segment suggests ongoing surveillance concerns, preventing speculative trading and ensuring only genuine investment transactions.
