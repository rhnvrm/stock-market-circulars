**Operational Impact**:

- The mandatory lot size of 1,200 shares requires higher minimum investment compared to main board stocks
- Initial listing in surveillance segment (Series ST) may restrict certain trading activities

- **Website**: www.neochem.in

**Trading Characteristics**: The placement in Trade for Trade segment with 'W' settlement type indicates stricter surveillance measures, requiring compulsory delivery-based trading without intraday squared-off positions allowed initially.
