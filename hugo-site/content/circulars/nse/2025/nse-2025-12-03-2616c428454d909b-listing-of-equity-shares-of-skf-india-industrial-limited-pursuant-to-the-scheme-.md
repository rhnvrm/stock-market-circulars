## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing creates a new traded entity on NSE, providing separate market identity to the Industrial Business previously housed within SKF India Limited. The 1:1 share exchange ratio ensures existing SKF India shareholders receive equivalent holdings in the demerged entity.

**Trading Impact**: Initial placement in BE (Trade for Trade) series means no intraday trading, delivery-based transactions only, and T+1 settlement. This provides a controlled trading environment during the initial listing phase before migration to regular EQ series.

**Corporate Structure Impact**: The demerger separates the Industrial Business into an independent listed entity (SKF India Industrial Limited), which was previously an unlisted wholly-owned subsidiary. This creates focused business entities and may improve operational efficiency and market valuation.

**Shareholder Impact**: All existing equity shareholders of SKF India Limited receive shares in the newly listed SKF India (Industrial) Limited on a 1:1 basis, maintaining their proportionate ownership in the demerged Industrial Business.
