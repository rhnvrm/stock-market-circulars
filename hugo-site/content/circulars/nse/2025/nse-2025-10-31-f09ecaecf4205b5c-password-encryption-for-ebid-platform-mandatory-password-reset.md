---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange has announced implementation of enhanced security measures for the eBID platform. All users must complete a mandatory one-time password reset on or after November 7, 2025. Users will be prompted to reset their password after successfully validating existing credentials, and system access will only be enabled after successful password reset.

## Key Points

- Enhanced security measures being implemented for eBID platform to improve cyber resilience
- One-time mandatory password reset required for all users
- Password reset requirement effective from end of day November 7, 2025
- Users will be prompted to reset password after validating existing credentials
- System access will be granted only after successful password reset
- Action required to avoid login-related issues

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational security enhancement measure by NSE for the eBID platform infrastructure.

## Compliance Requirements

- All eBID platform users must mandatorily reset their passwords on or after November 7, 2025
- Password reset must be completed to maintain access to the eBID platform
- Market participants should ensure all users are aware of this requirement
- Failure to reset password will result in login issues and inability to access the platform

## Important Dates

- **November 7, 2025**: Mandatory password reset becomes effective (end of day)
- Users attempting to login after this date will be prompted for password reset

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - All eBID platform users will need to perform a one-time password reset. While this is a straightforward process, market participants should plan ahead to ensure all users complete the reset promptly to avoid disruption to their debt segment operations. No impact on trading activities or market operations, but access to the eBID platform will be contingent on completing the password reset.
