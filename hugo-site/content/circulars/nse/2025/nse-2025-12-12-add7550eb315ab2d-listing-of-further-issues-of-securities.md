Minimal market impact. This is a standard administrative notification for ESOP allotments across multiple companies. The incremental equity capital is marginal relative to existing paid-up capital for most companies. No trading restrictions or lock-ins apply, ensuring immediate liquidity. Investors should note the dilution effect, though typically negligible given ESOP volumes.
