## Impact Assessment

**For Investors**: Existing debenture holders of Edelweiss Retail Finance Limited will now hold equivalent securities in ECL Finance Limited. The coupon rates (8.88% and 9.25%) and maturity year (2028) remain unchanged, ensuring continuity of investment terms.

**For Market**: Minimal market disruption expected as this is an administrative transfer pursuant to corporate restructuring. The securities will continue trading under new symbols and ISINs.

**For ECL Finance Limited**: Adds approximately ₹892.75 crore worth of listed debt securities to its balance sheet (assuming par value of ₹1 lakh per debenture), strengthening its presence in the debt capital markets.

**Liquidity Considerations**: Market lot size of 1 provides flexibility for retail and institutional investors to trade in smaller quantities.
