## Summary

NSE has temporarily suspended fresh subscriptions in Sundaram Global Brand Theme-Equity Active Fund of Fund on the NSE MF Invest Platform effective January 1, 2026.

- AMFI clarification dated January 30, 2022
- SEBI Circular no. SEBI/HO/IMD/IMD II/DOF3/P/CIR/2021/571 dated June 3, 2021

**For NSE Members:**
- Disable lumpsum subscriptions for the designated scheme from January 1, 2026

- **January 1, 2026**: Effective date for suspension of fresh subscriptions, SIP registrations, STP, and switch-in transactions
- **Duration**: Until further notice (temporary suspension)

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact:**
- Existing unitholders can continue their systematic investments and redeem without restrictions

- Existing investment values and returns remain unaffected

**Market Impact:**
- Limited to specific fund scheme; no broader market implications
