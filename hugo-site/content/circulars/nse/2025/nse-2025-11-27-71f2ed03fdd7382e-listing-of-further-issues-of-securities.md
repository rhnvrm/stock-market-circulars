**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine administrative circular for listing additional shares from ESOP exercises. The number of shares being listed is relatively small compared to the outstanding equity of these companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in tradable shares. The largest allotment is 323,135 shares by Aditya Infotech, which represents a minor percentage of typical trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: No direct impact on existing shareholders. Shares are issued on pari passu basis with no dilution concerns as ESOP schemes are typically pre-approved by shareholders.
