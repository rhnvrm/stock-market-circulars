---

## Summary

NSE introduces a lower band (floor) of 20% below the issue price during the special pre-open session for SME IPOs on the NSE Emerge platform. This complements the existing upper cap of 90% above issue price to standardize opening price discovery across exchanges.

- Upper band (cap) remains at 90% above issue price
- Applies only to SME IPOs on NSE Emerge platform
- Excludes Mainboard IPOs, relisted securities, and public debt
- Aims to standardize price discovery mechanism across exchanges

## Regulatory Changes

Price control mechanism for SME IPO special pre-open session now includes:
- Upper Band (cap): 90% over issue price (existing)
- Lower Band (floor): 20% below issue price (new)

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must comply with new price control mechanism
- Applies to trading activities in SME IPOs during special pre-open session
- Limited to NSE Emerge platform transactions

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: August 4, 2025
