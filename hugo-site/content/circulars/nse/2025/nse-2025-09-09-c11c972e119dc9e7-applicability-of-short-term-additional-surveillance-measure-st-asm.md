## Summary

- Applies to all open positions as on September 10, 2025 and new positions from September 11, 2025
- Royal Orchid Hotels Limited (ROHLTD) excluded from ASM framework
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

## Impact Assessment

The implementation of ST-ASM Stage I will significantly impact trading in the affected securities by increasing margin requirements to 50%. This measure aims to enhance market surveillance and risk management but may reduce trading volumes and liquidity in these securities. Market participants will face higher capital requirements for trading these stocks, potentially affecting price discovery and market participation.
