## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has mandated the use of a new portal for submitting penalty review requests. All penalty review requests raised after December 24, 2025 must be submitted through the new portal at https://ims.connect2nsccl.com/NCLMemberPortal/. The facility to raise penalty review requests in the old portal will be disabled/deactivated shortly. Existing review requests raised in the old portal will continue to be processed through the old portal.

## Key Points

- Old portal will be deactivated shortly for new submissions
- Existing requests in old portal will continue processing there

- Auto-generated Case IDs format: MM_[PENALTY_TYPE]_[NUMBER] (e.g., MM_NONSUB_01)
- Previous circulars referenced: NCL/CMPL/60651 (Feb 12, 2024) and NCL/CMPL/66692 (Feb 14, 2025)

## Regulatory Changes

Mandatory migration from old penalty review portal to new portal (https://ims.connect2nsccl.com/NCLMemberPortal/). The old portal functionality for raising new penalty review requests will be disabled/deactivated shortly, though existing requests will continue processing.

## Compliance Requirements

  - Contact details
  - Email address
  - Attachment (sample format available for download)

- Navigation path: Login on Inspection Portal → Statement Upload → Penalties at NCL → Submission for Penalty Review Request
- Case ID will be generated only for successful submissions; no Case ID for failure files

## Important Dates

- **December 24, 2025**: Circular issuance date; new portal becomes mandatory for all new penalty review requests
- **Shortly after December 24, 2025**: Old portal will be disabled/deactivated for new submissions
- **February 12, 2024**: Original circular NCL/CMPL/60651 introducing digital representation
- **February 14, 2025**: FAQ circular NCL/CMPL/66692 issued

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: High - All members and custodians must immediately adapt to the new portal system for penalty review requests. This represents a critical operational change affecting compliance and penalty management processes.

**Process Impact**: Members need to familiarize themselves with the new portal interface, mandatory fields, and submission procedures. The new system includes auto-populated fields (member code, member name, date), tooltip guidance, and automated Case ID generation.

**Technical Impact**: The new portal is accessed through a different URL (https://ims.connect2nsccl.com/NCLMemberPortal/) than the login portal (https://inspection.nseindia.com/MemberPortal/), requiring members to understand the navigation flow.

**Support**: Contact available via toll-free number 1800 266 0050 IVR 2 and email membermonitoring@nsccl.co.in. Detailed annexures provide step-by-step guidance for both submission (Annexure 1) and viewing (Annexure 2) of penalty review requests.
