Quantity freeze limits are regulatory safeguards that prevent execution of orders beyond specified quantities in a single transaction.

- **File Access**: Files available from faoftp/faocommon directory on NSE Extranet server

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects all F&O traders dealing in index derivatives. The limits define maximum order quantities that can be executed in single transactions.

**Operational Impact**: Members need to update their trading systems with new contract specifications. MIDCPNIFTY has the highest freeze limit at 2800 contracts, while BANKNIFTY and NIFTYNXT50 have the lowest at 600 contracts each. NIFTY and FINNIFTY maintain identical limits at 1800 contracts.

**Trading Impact**: Orders exceeding these limits will be frozen and require manual intervention. Traders must structure large orders accordingly to avoid execution issues.
