## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has announced a face value split for Computer Age Management Services Limited (CAMS). The face value and paid-up value of CAMS equity shares will be subdivided from Rs. 10 per share to Rs. 2 per share, effective December 05, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Computer Age Management Services Limited (Symbol: CAMS)
- Existing face value and paid-up value: Rs. 10 per share
- New face value and paid-up value: Rs. 2 per share
- Effective date: December 05, 2025
- Circular reference: NSE/CML/71437, Circular No. 2275/2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action involving subdivision of existing equity shares in the ratio of 5:1 (each share of Rs. 10 face value will be split into 5 shares of Rs. 2 face value).

## Compliance Requirements

- Members and market participants should note the change in face value and paid-up value
- All trading and settlement systems should reflect the new face value from the effective date
- Existing shareholders will receive proportionately increased number of shares with reduced face value

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** November 24, 2025
- **Effective Date:** December 05, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The face value split will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5 times while reducing the price per share proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors. The split does not affect the company's market capitalization or the proportionate ownership of existing shareholders. Trading systems and derivatives contracts (if any) will need adjustments to reflect the new face value and share count.
