This circular continues the phased implementation of the Graded Surveillance Measure framework, previously communicated through circulars dated February 23, 2017, July 20, 2018, November 29, 2019, November 17, 2023, September 20, 2024, and September 12, 2025. The GSM framework consists of four stages with progressively stricter surveillance actions:

**Stage I**: 100% margin rate and 5% or lower price band

**Stage II**: Trade-for-trade with 5% or lower price band and 50% ASD from buyers

**Stage III**: Trade-for-trade with 5% or lower price band, weekly trading only, and 100% ASD from buyers

**Stage IV**: Trade-for-trade with 5% or lower price band, weekly trading only, 100% ASD from buyers, and no upward movement allowed

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure trade-to-trade settlement for EUROTEXIND with no netting off
- Buyers must deposit 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit of trade value
- Trading only permitted on Mondays or the first trading day of each week
- Price band restrictions of 5% or lower must be observed
- Members should exercise adequate precautions when trading in the affected security
- Queries should be directed to surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: November 04, 2025
- **Effective Date**: November 06, 2025 - EUROTEXIND moves to Stage III of GSM

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The move to Stage III GSM severely restricts trading in EUROTEXIND, reducing liquidity and trading frequency to once per week only. The 5% price band limits volatility but also restricts price discovery.

**Liquidity Impact**: Very High - Trade-for-trade settlement with no netting off, combined with weekly trading frequency, will significantly reduce liquidity and trading volumes.

**Cost Impact**: High - The 100% ASD requirement substantially increases the cost of buying the security, as buyers must deposit the full trade value as additional margin on top of regular margins.

**Investor Impact**: High - Existing investors may face difficulty exiting positions due to restricted trading frequency and reduced liquidity. New investors face substantial entry barriers due to high ASD requirements.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members need to ensure proper controls and systems are in place to handle trade-for-trade settlement, weekly trading restrictions, and ASD collection from buyers.
