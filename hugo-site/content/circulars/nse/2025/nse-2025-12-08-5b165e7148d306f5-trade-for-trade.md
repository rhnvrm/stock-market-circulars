Four securities (NECLIFE, ORTINGLOBE, AXITA, SHYAMCENT) will move from Rolling segment (EQ series) to BE series, and one security (GSTL) will move from SM series to ST series. Additionally, 4 securities will continue in Trade for Trade segment. All settlements will be on trade-to-trade basis with no netting off allowed.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

Under Capital Market Segment Trading Regulations Part - A, 2.6:
- Securities moved to Trade for Trade segment (BE/ST series) with 5% price band
- Removal from rolling segment (EQ/SM series)
- Mandatory trade-to-trade settlement without netting off facility

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: December 8, 2025
- **Effective Date**: December 11, 2025 (Thursday)

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact**: The movement to Trade for Trade segment significantly restricts trading flexibility by eliminating netting off facilities and imposing a tight 5% price band. This will reduce liquidity and increase settlement obligations for traders. The action affects 9 securities total (5 new + 4 continuing), impacting investors holding positions in these stocks. The criteria triggering this action (Price Earnings Multiple, Price Variation & Market Capitalization) indicates volatility concerns. While NSE clarifies this is not adverse action against companies, the practical effect is substantial trading restrictions to protect market integrity and investor interests.
