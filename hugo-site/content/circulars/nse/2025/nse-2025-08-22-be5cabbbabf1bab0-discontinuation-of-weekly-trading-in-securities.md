## Summary

NSE announces the discontinuation of weekly trading restrictions for Gangotri Textiles Limited (GANGOTRI) effective September 09, 2025. The company was previously restricted to trading only on the first trading day of every week on a 'Trade for Trade' basis due to non-compliance with Board composition requirements under SEBI Listing Regulations.

- Company was suspended for non-compliance with Regulation 17(1) regarding Board composition
- Non-compliance occurred for two consecutive quarters: June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024
- Mandated six-month period of weekly trading will be completed on September 10, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Transition from restricted weekly trading to normal trading operations for Gangotri Textiles Limited, removing the limitation of trading only on the first trading day of each week.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. This circular represents the completion of the remedial trading restriction period imposed for previous non-compliance with Board composition requirements.

## Important Dates

- **September 08, 2025**: Last day of weekly trading restrictions (closing hour)
- **September 09, 2025**: Effective date for discontinuation of weekly trading restrictions
