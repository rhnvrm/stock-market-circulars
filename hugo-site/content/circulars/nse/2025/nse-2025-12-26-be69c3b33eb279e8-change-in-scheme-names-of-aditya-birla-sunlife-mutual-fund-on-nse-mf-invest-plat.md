title: Change in Scheme Names of Aditya Birla Sunlife Mutual Fund on NSE MF Invest
  Platform
---

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sunlife Mutual Fund has announced name changes for two US Treasury Bond ETF Fund of Funds schemes effective December 29, 2025. The changes comply with SEBI's revised Framework for launching Fund of Fund (FOF) schemes with multiple underlying funds. The revised names will replace "Fund of Funds" with "Passive FOF" and adjust "Bond" to "Bonds" in the scheme titles. All other features, terms, and conditions of the schemes remain unchanged.

## Key Points

- Two schemes are being renamed on the NSE MF Invest platform
- Aditya Birla Sun Life US Treasury 1-3 Year Bond ETFs Fund of Funds becomes Aditya Birla Sun Life US Treasury 1-3 Year Bonds ETFs Passive FOF
- Aditya Birla Sun Life US Treasury 3-10 Year Bond ETFs Fund of Funds becomes Aditya Birla Sun Life US Treasury 3-10 Year Bonds ETFs Passive FOF
- Changes are administrative only; no impact on scheme features or investor holdings
- Notice-cum-Addendum No. 55/2025 issued by Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited

## Regulatory Changes

The name changes align with SEBI Letter no. SEBI/HO/IMD/IMD-RAC-1/P/OW/2025/4102/1 dated February 6, 2025, concerning the Framework for launching Fund of Fund (FOF) schemes with multiple underlying funds, as revised on June 30, 2025. The new naming convention distinguishes passive FOF schemes more clearly in compliance with SEBI's standardization requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members and investors are informed of the scheme name changes
- Relevant changes will be carried out in the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)
- The notice-cum-addendum forms an integral part of SID and KIM documentation
- No action required from existing investors as all scheme features remain unchanged

## Important Dates

- **December 24, 2025**: Notice-cum-Addendum issued by Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited
- **December 26, 2025**: NSE circular issued to all members
- **December 29, 2025**: Effective date for scheme name changes on NSE MF Invest platform

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this change is minimal as it is purely administrative. Investors in these schemes will see updated scheme names on their statements and the NSE MF Invest platform, but there are no changes to investment strategy, portfolio composition, risk profile, expense ratios, or any other scheme features. The renaming brings the schemes in line with SEBI's standardized nomenclature for passive Fund of Funds, improving clarity and consistency across the mutual fund industry.
