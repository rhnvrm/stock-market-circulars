## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it is a routine notification for a new mutual fund offer launch. The impact is limited to:

- **Investors**: Provides access to a new healthcare-focused equity fund option through the NSE MF Invest Platform
- **Distributors/Members**: Need to configure systems to accept subscriptions for the six new scheme variants during the NFO period
- **Market**: No direct impact on stock market operations or trading activities

The healthcare sector focus may attract investors seeking exposure to pharmaceutical and healthcare stocks, but this represents standard product expansion rather than a significant market event.
