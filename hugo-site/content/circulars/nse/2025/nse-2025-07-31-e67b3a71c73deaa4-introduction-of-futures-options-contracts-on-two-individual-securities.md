## Impact Assessment

Moderate impact as it expands derivative trading options for two specific securities. NUVAMA represents wealth management sector while SUZLON provides exposure to renewable energy sector. The large lot size difference (75 vs 8,000) reflects significant price variations between the two underlying securities. Enhanced liquidity and hedging opportunities expected for these stocks.
