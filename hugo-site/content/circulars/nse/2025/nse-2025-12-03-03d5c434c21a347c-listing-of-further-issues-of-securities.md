## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. These are routine ESOP allotments representing small quantities relative to the total issued capital of the companies. The absence of lock-in restrictions means shares can be traded immediately, but given the small volumes, significant price impact is unlikely.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in tradable float for each security.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders face minimal dilution. All new shares carry equal rights with existing equity shares (pari passu status).

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to recognize the new distinctive number ranges for each security.
