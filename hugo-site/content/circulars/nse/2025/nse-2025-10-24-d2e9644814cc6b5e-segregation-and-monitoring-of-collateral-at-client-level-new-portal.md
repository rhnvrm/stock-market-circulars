This circular has medium operational impact on NSE Clearing members. The extension provides additional time for members to comply with collateral reporting requirements during the system enhancement period. Members need to ensure their internal processes are aligned to meet the October 28 deadline. There is no direct market impact, but non-compliance could affect member operations and regulatory standing. The system enhancement suggests improvements to the collateral monitoring infrastructure.
