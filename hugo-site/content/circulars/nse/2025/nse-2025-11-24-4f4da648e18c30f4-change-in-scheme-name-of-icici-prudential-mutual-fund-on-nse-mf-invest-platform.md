title: Change in Scheme Name of ICICI Prudential Income plus Arbitrage Active FOF
---

## Summary

ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company Limited has announced a change in the name and categorization of its Fund of Funds scheme. The "ICICI Prudential Income plus Arbitrage Active FOF" will be renamed to "ICICI Prudential Income plus Arbitrage Omni FOF" effective November 25, 2025. This change is made pursuant to the SEBI framework for Fund of Funds schemes and has been approved by ICICI Prudential Trust Limited (Trustee) and ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company Limited (AMC).

## Key Points

- Scheme name changes from "ICICI Prudential Income plus Arbitrage Active FOF" to "ICICI Prudential Income plus Arbitrage Omni FOF"
- Scheme type revised to include both active and passive debt oriented schemes and arbitrage schemes
- Product labelling changes from "Short Term Savings" to "Medium to Short Term Savings"
- Investment objective expanded to include units of domestic active and passive debt oriented schemes
- Asset allocation pattern remains similar: 95-100% in units of debt oriented and arbitrage schemes, 0-5% in money market instruments
- Minimum 10% investment requirement in debt oriented schemes continues
- Changes approved by Trustee and AMC pursuant to SEBI's Fund of Funds framework

## Regulatory Changes

The scheme recategorization aligns with the extant framework issued by SEBI for Fund of Funds. The revised scheme features now explicitly include passive debt oriented schemes in addition to active schemes, broadening the investment universe. The addendum updates the Scheme Information Documents (SIDs) and Key Information Memorandums (KIMs) accordingly.

## Compliance Requirements

Existing investors in the scheme will automatically transition to the renamed scheme. The AMC will update all scheme documentation including SIDs and KIMs to reflect the new name and revised features. No action is required from existing unitholders as this is an administrative change that does not materially alter the investment strategy or risk profile.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: November 25, 2025 - Date from which the scheme name change and recategorization becomes effective

## Impact Assessment

This is primarily an administrative change with minimal market impact. The inclusion of passive debt oriented schemes provides the fund manager with additional flexibility in portfolio construction but does not fundamentally change the scheme's investment approach. The scheme continues to maintain its focus on generating regular income through investments in debt oriented and arbitrage schemes. Existing investors experience continuity in investment strategy with enhanced options for the fund manager to optimize returns through both active and passive debt schemes.
