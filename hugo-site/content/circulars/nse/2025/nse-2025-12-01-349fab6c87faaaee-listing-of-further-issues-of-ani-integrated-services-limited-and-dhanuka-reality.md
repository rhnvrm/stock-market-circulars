## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing notification for two SME segment companies with modest issuance sizes (aggregate value approximately Rs. 17.85 crore). The listings increase tradable float for existing companies rather than introducing new entities.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Trading members need to update their systems with new security details and lot sizes. AISL's lock-in until mid-2027 restricts immediate trading of these specific shares.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to existing shareholders and preferential allottees of these two companies. AISL warrant conversion indicates exercise of rights by existing warrant holders. DRL's preferential issue linked to loan agreement terms suggests structured financing arrangement.
