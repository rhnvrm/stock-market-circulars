## Summary

National Stock Exchange of India has announced a change in the ISIN code for equity shares of Geekay Wires Limited (Symbol: GEEKAYWIRE). The new ISIN code INE669X01032 will be effective from October 30, 2025, following a sub-division of equity shares from face value Rs. 2/- to Re. 1/-.

## Key Points

- Company: Geekay Wires Limited
- Symbol: GEEKAYWIRE
- New ISIN: INE669X01032
- Reason: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs. 2/- to Re. 1/-
- The new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date

## Regulatory Changes

This is an administrative change to update the ISIN code in NSE's system to reflect the corporate action of stock sub-division undertaken by Geekay Wires Limited.

## Compliance Requirements

Exchange members are informed to note the ISIN change and ensure their systems are updated to use the new ISIN code for all trades in Geekay Wires Limited equity shares from the effective date.

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 29, 2025
- **Effective Date (Ex-Date)**: October 30, 2025
- New ISIN applicable for all trades on and from October 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Minimal impact - This is a routine administrative change following a corporate action (stock split). The sub-division increases the number of shares while reducing the face value proportionately, making shares more affordable for retail investors. Trading will continue normally under the new ISIN from the ex-date.
