## Suspended Securities Details

| Sr. No. | Company Name | ISIN | Suspension Date | Reason |
|---------|--------------|------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | Power Finance Corporation Limited | INE134E08DI3 | 14-Nov-25 | Redemption |
| 2 | REC Limited | INE020B08ET5 | 14-Nov-25 | Redemption |
| 3 | Sammaan Capital Limited | INE148I07DL0 | 14-Nov-25 | Redemption |

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders of these specific NCDs. This is a routine administrative action following the scheduled redemption of debt securities. The suspension ensures orderly market operations by preventing trading in securities that are being redeemed. There is no broader market impact expected, as this affects only three specific debt instruments that have reached their redemption date. Investors holding these NCDs will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms of the instruments.
