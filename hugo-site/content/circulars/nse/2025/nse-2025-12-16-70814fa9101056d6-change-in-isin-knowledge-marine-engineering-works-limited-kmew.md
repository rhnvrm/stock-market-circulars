## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has notified members about a change in the ISIN code for Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Limited (KMEW) equity shares. The change is necessitated by a sub-division of the face value of shares from Rs. 10/- to Rs. 5/-. The new ISIN code INE0CJD01029 will be effective for all trades executed on and from December 22, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Limited
- Stock Symbol: KMEW
- New ISIN Code: INE0CJD01029
- Reason: Sub-division of share face value from Rs. 10/- to Rs. 5/-
- Ex-date: December 22, 2025
- All trades from the ex-date onwards will use the new ISIN

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action resulting in an administrative change to the ISIN code to reflect the new face value of equity shares after sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Exchange members must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN code for KMEW
- All trades executed on or after December 22, 2025 must use the new ISIN INE0CJD01029
- Members should ensure proper reconciliation and client communication regarding the ISIN change

## Important Dates

- **December 16, 2025**: Circular issued
- **December 22, 2025**: Ex-date - New ISIN becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division from Rs. 10 to Rs. 5 face value will double the number of shares while halving the price per share, potentially improving liquidity and making the stock more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members and market participants need to update their systems and databases to reflect the new ISIN code. Existing shareholders will receive additional shares in their demat accounts in the ratio of 1:1 (one new share for every existing share).

**Investor Impact**: Neutral to positive - While the total investment value remains unchanged, the lower price per share post-subdivision may attract more retail participation. Investors should note that their holding quantity will double while the price per share will be halved.
