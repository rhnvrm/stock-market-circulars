title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - December 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has implemented Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) for three securities under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I effective December 8, 2025. The circular mandates 100% margin requirements on all positions and provides for potential segment shifts for Stage IV securities from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment.

## Key Points

- Three securities shortlisted under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I: Rajdarshan Industries Limited (ARENTERP), Nectar Lifesciences Limited (NECLIFE), and ORTIN GLOBAL LIMITED (ORTINGLOBE)
- 100% margin applicable on all open positions as on December 9, 2025 and new positions from December 10, 2025 onwards
- Securities qualifying under criteria VII (Stage IV) will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE)
- No securities currently listed under Stage IV or moving between stages
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance purposes and not an adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

Enhanced surveillance measures implemented through Long-Term ASM framework:
- Introduction of 100% margin requirements for shortlisted securities
- Framework allows for progressive stage-wise escalation (Stage I to Stage IV)
- Securities at Stage IV face segment shift from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade, significantly restricting intraday trading
- Price band reinstatement provisions when securities exit the framework

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must apply 100% margin rate effective December 10, 2025
- Margin applicable to all open positions as on December 9, 2025
- Margin applicable to all new positions created from December 10, 2025 onwards
- Members must comply with ASM measures in addition to all other existing surveillance requirements
- Members should monitor shortlisted securities for stage progression

## Important Dates

- **December 5, 2025**: Circular issued (Circular Ref. No: 941/2025)
- **December 8, 2025**: Securities shortlisted under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- **December 9, 2025**: Last date for existing positions before new margin requirements
- **December 10, 2025**: 100% margin requirement becomes effective; Stage IV securities (if any) shift to Trade-for-Trade segment

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Significant reduction in trading activity expected for ARENTERP, NECLIFE, and ORTINGLOBE due to 100% margin requirements
- Elimination of leverage for these securities, potentially reducing speculative trading
- Increased capital requirements for traders holding positions in affected securities

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers must ensure adequate margin collection from clients
- Enhanced monitoring required for position limits and margin compliance
- Potential forced liquidation of positions if clients cannot meet 100% margin requirements

**Liquidity Impact:**
- Expected decrease in liquidity for shortlisted securities
- Wider bid-ask spreads likely due to reduced trading volumes
- Stage IV progression would further restrict liquidity through Trade-for-Trade segment placement

**Reference Information:**
- This circular references previous ASM circulars dating from October 27, 2018 through September 20, 2024
