title: Revision w.r.t Client Categories in Unique Client Code Database
---

## Summary

NSE is revising the client category structure in the Unique Client Code (UCC) database to facilitate better identification of Non-Resident External (NRE) and Non-Resident Ordinary (NRO) clients. The existing NRI category (code 11) will be reclassified as NRE, and a new category code 37 will be introduced for NRO clients. Trading members must update their client records accordingly by the effective date.

## Key Points

- Current NRI client category (code 11) will be treated as NRE effective November 22, 2025
- New investor category code 37 created for NRO account holders
- Trading members must update all client records in the UCC database
- No changes required for existing UCCs created for NRE accounts
- Changes will be available on UCI Online from November 22, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

**Client Category Structure:**

| Client Category | Category Code | Remarks |
|----------------|---------------|----------|
| NRE | 11 | Existing NRI clients shall be treated as NRE |
| NRO | 37 | Client category for NRO account holders |

The exchange is creating these new investor categories to enable easier identification and classification of non-resident clients based on their account types.

## Compliance Requirements

**Trading Members must:**

1. Review all existing client records in the UCC database
2. Update client classifications as needed:
   - Clients with NRE accounts: No change required if already under category 11
   - Clients with NRO accounts: Update to new category code 37
3. Complete all necessary updates before the effective date
4. Ensure accurate classification going forward
5. Contact uci@nse.co.in for any queries
