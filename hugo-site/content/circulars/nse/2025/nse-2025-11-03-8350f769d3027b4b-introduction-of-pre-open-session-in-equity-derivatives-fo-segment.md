title: Introduction of Pre-Open Session in Equity Derivatives (F&O) Segment
---

## Summary

NSE is introducing a pre-open session in the Equity Derivatives (F&O) Segment following SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2025/79 dated May 29, 2025. The pre-open session will run from 9:00 AM to 9:15 AM using a call auction mechanism, applicable to current-month futures contracts on single stocks and indices. During the last five trading days before expiry, the session extends to next-month futures contracts.

## Key Points

- Pre-open session duration: 15 minutes (9:00 AM to 9:15 AM)
- Call auction mechanism will be used
- Order entry period: 9:00 AM to 9:08 AM with system-driven random closure between 7th and 8th minute
- Order matching and trade confirmation: 9:08 AM to 9:12 AM
- Buffer period for transition: 9:12 AM to 9:15 AM
- Random closure of equity segment and equity derivatives segment pre-open will be independent
- Both limit and market orders allowed; Stop loss and IOC orders not permitted
- Same lot size, tick size, and price band as normal market
- Book type: "PO"

## Regulatory Changes

- Introduction of mandatory pre-open session for equity derivatives futures contracts
- Pre-open session timing: 9:00 AM to 9:15 AM (before regular trading hours)
- Three distinct phases: Order Entry Period, Order Matching Period, and Buffer Period
- In case of market-wide circuit filter breach or outage, market will reopen with pre-open session with timings announced separately

## Compliance Requirements

**Eligible Contracts:**
- Current-month (M1) futures on single stocks and indices are eligible
- Next-month (M2) futures become eligible during last 5 trading days before current month expiry
- Far-month (M3) futures NOT eligible
- Spread and Option contracts NOT eligible
- Futures contracts on ex-date of corporate action due to scheme of arrangement NOT eligible

**Trading Rules:**
- Members must ensure systems are ready for pre-open session
- Order entry, modification, and cancellation allowed during 9:00-9:08 AM
- Only limit and market orders permitted
- Special term orders (Stop loss, IOC) not allowed
- Opening price determination occurs during order matching period

## Important Dates

- Circular Reference: NSE/FAOP/71092, Circular No. 184/2025
- Circular Date: November 03, 2025
- Reference to SEBI circular dated: May 29, 2025
- Reference to previous NSE circular NSE/FAOP/69898 dated: August 28, 2025
- Implementation: To be effective as per exchange notification

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- High impact on all F&O market participants including traders, brokers, and institutions
- Changes daily trading routine with earlier market start at 9:00 AM
- Price discovery will begin 15 minutes earlier through call auction mechanism
- May reduce opening volatility through structured price discovery

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading systems and algorithms need updates to handle pre-open session
- Order management systems must distinguish between pre-open and regular session orders
- Risk management systems need recalibration for pre-open period
- Member firms must train trading staff on new session timings and rules
- Surveillance and monitoring systems require modifications

**Technical Impact:**
- Random closure mechanism between 7th and 8th minute requires system adaptation
- Independent random closure for equity and derivatives segments adds complexity
- Buffer period implementation needed for smooth transition to continuous trading
- Order type restrictions (no stop loss/IOC) require validation logic updates
