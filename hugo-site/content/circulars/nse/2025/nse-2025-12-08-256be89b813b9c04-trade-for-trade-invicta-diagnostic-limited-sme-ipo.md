## Summary

NSE has announced that Invicta Diagnostic Limited, which debuted through an SME IPO, will be moved from the trade for trade segment (Series: ST) to the rolling segment (Series: SM) effective December 22, 2025. This follows the earlier circular NSE/CML/71671 dated December 05, 2025 and is in accordance with SEBI guidelines.

## Key Points

- Invicta Diagnostic Limited (Symbol: INVICTA) will transition from trade for trade segment to rolling segment
- Current Series: ST (Trade for Trade)
- New Series: SM (Rolling Segment)
- Change is pursuant to SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012
- References earlier NSE circular NSE/CML/71671 dated December 05, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The transfer from trade for trade segment to rolling segment represents a relaxation of trading restrictions. In the rolling segment, investors can engage in regular intraday and delivery trading, whereas the trade for trade segment requires mandatory delivery settlement for all transactions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members should update their systems to reflect the new series code (SM) for INVICTA
- Trading terminals and backend systems must be configured for rolling segment operations
- Risk management systems should be adjusted for the changed segment classification

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date:** December 08, 2025
- **Effective Date of Transfer:** December 22, 2025
- **Reference Circular Date:** December 05, 2025 (NSE/CML/71671)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The move to rolling segment will increase liquidity and trading flexibility for Invicta Diagnostic Limited shares, making it more attractive to retail and institutional investors who can now participate in intraday trading.

**Operational Impact:** Low - This is a standard post-IPO transition for SME listings. Trading members need to update system configurations but no significant operational challenges are expected.

**Investor Impact:** Positive - Investors gain more trading options including intraday positions, which were not possible in the trade for trade segment where all trades required compulsory delivery.
