## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has announced a change in the ISIN code for Nuvama Wealth Management Limited (NUVAMA) effective December 26, 2025. The change is necessitated by a stock subdivision where the face value of equity shares will be split from Rs. 10 per share to Rs. 2 per share. The new ISIN code INE531F01023 will be applicable for all trades executed on or after the ex-date.

## Key Points

- Company affected: Nuvama Wealth Management Limited (Symbol: NUVAMA)
- New ISIN Code: INE531F01023
- Reason: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs. 10/- to Rs. 2/-
- Effective date: December 26, 2025 (Ex-date)
- The new ISIN applies to all trades from the ex-date onwards

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action notification for ISIN code modification following a stock split.

## Compliance Requirements

- Exchange members must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN code
- All trades executed on or after December 26, 2025 must use the new ISIN INE531F01023
- Trading and settlement systems must be configured to handle the stock subdivision
- Members should ensure client records and portfolios are updated with the new ISIN

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** December 17, 2025
- **Ex-Date:** December 26, 2025 (new ISIN becomes effective)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The stock subdivision from Rs. 10 to Rs. 2 will result in a 5:1 split, making shares more affordable and potentially increasing liquidity. The ISIN change is an administrative necessity that accompanies this corporate action.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Exchange members, custodians, and clearing systems must update their databases and trading platforms to reflect the new ISIN. Investors holding NUVAMA shares will see their holdings adjusted proportionately (5 new shares for every 1 old share) with the lower face value.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Existing shareholders will receive additional shares in the 5:1 ratio, with total investment value remaining unchanged. The lower price per share may attract retail investors and improve trading volumes.
