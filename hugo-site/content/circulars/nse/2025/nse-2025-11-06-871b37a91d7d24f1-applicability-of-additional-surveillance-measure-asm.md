title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM)
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a circular regarding the applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework. One security, Silly Monks Entertainment Limited (Symbol: SILLYMONKS), has been included under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I effective November 7, 2025. The security will be subject to 100% margin requirement on all positions starting November 11, 2025. No securities have been moved to Stage-IV or progressed between other stages in this update.

## Key Points

- Silly Monks Entertainment Limited (SILLYMONKS, ISIN: INE203Y01012) included in Long-Term ASM Stage-I
- 100% margin requirement will apply on all open positions as on November 10, 2025 and new positions from November 11, 2025
- No securities shifted to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE) in this circular
- No securities listed under Stage-IV or moved between other ASM stages
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Circular references previous ASM circulars from October 2018 through September 2024

## Regulatory Changes

The Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework continues to be implemented as per existing provisions. Securities qualifying under criteria VII (Scrips shifted to Stage IV) would be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE), though no securities met this criteria in the current update.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure 100% margin collection on SILLYMONKS effective November 11, 2025
- Margin requirement applies to:
  - All open positions as on November 10, 2025
  - All new positions created from November 11, 2025 onwards
- Market participants must comply with ASM framework alongside all other surveillance measures
- Members should monitor the NSE ASM FAQ page for detailed information: https://www.nseindia.com/regulations/additional-surveillance-measure

## Important Dates

- **November 6, 2025**: Circular issued (Circular Ref. No: 858/2025)
- **November 7, 2025**: Effective date for inclusion of SILLYMONKS in Long-Term ASM Stage-I
- **November 10, 2025**: Last date with existing margin requirements for open positions
- **November 11, 2025**: 100% margin requirement becomes applicable on all positions in SILLYMONKS

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to one security (SILLYMONKS) and its trading members. The 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for traders holding or trading this security, likely reducing speculative activity and trading volumes. The ASM inclusion is purely a market surveillance action and should not be construed as adverse action against Silly Monks Entertainment Limited. Market participants can contact surveillance@nse.co.in for queries. The broader market impact is minimal as this affects only one scrip with no securities moving to more restrictive stages.
