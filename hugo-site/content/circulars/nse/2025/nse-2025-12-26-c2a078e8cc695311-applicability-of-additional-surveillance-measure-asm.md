title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - Long Term Framework
---

## Summary

NSE has issued surveillance measures under the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (Long Term-ASM) framework for three securities. Effective December 31, 2025, these securities will be subject to 100% margin requirements on all positions. Securities qualifying under criteria VII (Stage IV) will also be shifted from the Rolling Settlement segment (EQ series) to the Trade-for-Trade segment (BE series). Two securities (AATMAJ and TPHQ) have been moved from Short-Term ASM to Long-Term ASM framework.

## Key Points

- Three securities shortlisted under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I: Aatmaj Healthcare Limited (AATMAJ), A and M Jumbo Bags Limited (AMJUMBO), and Teamo Productions HQ Limited (TPHQ)
- AATMAJ and TPHQ have been moved from ST-ASM to LT-ASM framework
- 100% margin requirement applicable on all open positions as on December 30, 2025 and new positions from December 31, 2025 onwards
- No securities listed for Stage-IV (shift to Trade-for-Trade segment) at this time
- No securities moving between Stage-I to Stage-II or Stage-II to Stage-III
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

This circular references previous NSE circulars on ASM framework dating from October 2018 to September 2024. The Long-Term ASM framework implements progressive surveillance stages based on specific criteria. Securities in Stage-IV would be shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ) to Trade-for-Trade (BE) segment, though no securities qualify for this stage in the current update.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must ensure 100% margin collection on all open positions in the three listed securities as of December 30, 2025
- 100% margin requirement applies to all new positions created from December 31, 2025 onwards
- Market participants must comply with ASM framework alongside all other surveillance measures
- Members should monitor price band changes - securities moving out of ASM will have price bands reinstated to pre-ASM levels (subject to other surveillance measures)

## Important Dates

- **December 26, 2025**: Circular issued
- **December 29, 2025**: Securities shortlisted in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- **December 30, 2025**: Last day before margin requirements apply to open positions
- **December 31, 2025**: 100% margin requirement becomes effective on all positions

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The 100% margin requirement will significantly reduce leveraged trading in these securities, potentially decreasing trading volumes and liquidity. Investors will need to commit full cash for positions, eliminating margin trading benefits.

**Market Liquidity**: These measures typically result in reduced market participation and wider bid-ask spreads due to higher capital requirements and perceived risk signals.

**Investor Sentiment**: Being placed under Long-Term ASM may negatively impact investor sentiment, despite NSE's clarification that it is not an adverse action against the companies. The move of AATMAJ and TPHQ from short-term to long-term surveillance indicates persistent concerns.

**Operational Requirements**: Brokers must ensure adequate risk management systems to enforce 100% margin collection and educate clients about restricted trading in these securities.
