## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects existing shareholders of Capital Trust Limited and potential RE investors

**Operational Impact:** 
- Trading members must update systems to recognize new security code CAPTRU-RE1

- Investors need clear understanding that REs are different from ordinary shares
