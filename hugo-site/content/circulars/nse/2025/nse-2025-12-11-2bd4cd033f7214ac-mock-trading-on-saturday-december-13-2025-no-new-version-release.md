## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a scheduled mock session with no impact on live trading.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members must:
- Allocate resources for mock session participation

- Ensure proper NEAT Adapter version compatibility
- Submit compliance evidence to the exchange

**Technology Impact**: Members need to verify their systems work correctly with the new encryption mechanism for interactive messages and immediate order acknowledgement. Multiple NEAT Adapter versions are supported during the transition period, providing flexibility but requiring careful configuration management.

**Compliance Impact**: Mandatory evidence submission requirement creates additional compliance obligations for trading members under SEBI's retail investor protection framework for algorithmic trading.
