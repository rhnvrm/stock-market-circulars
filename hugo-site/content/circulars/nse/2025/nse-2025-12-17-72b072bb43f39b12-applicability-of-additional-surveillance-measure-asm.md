title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - December 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has issued an update to the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) Framework effective December 18, 2025. One new security, Agri-Tech (India) Limited (AGRITECH), has been added to Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I. No securities are being moved between stages, excluded from the framework, or placed in Stage-IV. The consolidated list shows multiple securities currently under ASM surveillance across different stages.

## Key Points

- Agri-Tech (India) Limited (Symbol: AGRITECH, ISIN: INE449G01018) added to Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- No securities shortlisted for Stage-IV placement
- No securities moving between stages (I to II, II to III, III to IV, or reverse movements)
- No securities being excluded from ASM Framework
- All changes effective from December 18, 2025
- Consolidated ASM list includes securities like ABINFRA, AMBANIORGO, APOLLO, ARENTERP, ARTNIRMAN, ARVEE, and ATALREAL in Stage-I

## Regulatory Changes

The Long-Term ASM Framework continues to apply staged surveillance measures to identified securities. Stage-IV securities (when applicable) are shifted from Rolling Settlement (Series: EQ) to Trade for Trade (Series: BE) on a T+3 basis from the date of circular issuance. This circular represents a routine update to the ASM framework with minimal changes to the existing surveillance landscape.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the inclusion of AGRITECH in ASM Stage-I surveillance
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting requirements apply to securities under ASM framework
- Investors and brokers should be aware of the surveillance status when trading affected securities
- Standard ASM Stage-I conditions apply to newly added security including potential price bands and quantity restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: December 18, 2025 - ASM changes come into effect
- **Circular Date**: December 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to Agri-Tech (India) Limited and existing ASM securities. Addition to ASM Stage-I typically results in enhanced surveillance, potential trading restrictions such as reduced price bands, and increased scrutiny of unusual price/volume movements. For AGRITECH specifically, this may lead to reduced liquidity and increased compliance obligations for market participants. The stability in stage movements (no securities progressing or regressing) suggests most securities are maintaining their surveillance status, indicating stable market conditions for previously identified stocks.
