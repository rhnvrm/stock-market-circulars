title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Updates - September 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has updated its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective September 10, 2025. Two new securities (INFLUX and SALSTEEL) have been added to ESM Stage-I, while two securities (PATTECH and TANKUP) have been moved from Stage-I to Stage-II. Additionally, INFLUX and SALSTEEL will move from EQ/SM to BE/ST segment effective September 11, 2025.

## Key Points

- 2 securities added to ESM Stage-I: Influx Healthtech Limited and S.A.L. Steel Limited
- 2 securities moved from ESM Stage-I to Stage-II: Pattech Fitwell Tube Components Limited and Tankup Engineers Limited
- No securities moved from Stage-II to Stage-I
- No securities excluded from ESM framework
- Total of 62 securities currently under ESM framework (28 in Stage-II, 34 in Stage-I)
- Segment changes for newly added securities from EQ/SM to BE/ST

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework continues to monitor securities based on price volatility, trading volumes, and other market parameters. Securities under ESM are subject to additional surveillance measures including:
- Enhanced disclosure requirements
- Stricter position limits
- Additional margin requirements
- Regular monitoring of trading activities

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with enhanced surveillance measures for listed securities
- Brokers must ensure appropriate risk management for ESM securities
- Companies under ESM must maintain enhanced compliance standards
- Trading members must monitor client positions more closely for ESM securities

## Important Dates

- **September 10, 2025**: ESM stage changes become effective
- **September 11, 2025**: Segment change from EQ/SM to BE/ST for INFLUX and SALSTEEL

## Impact Assessment

The addition of securities to ESM Stage-I indicates increased regulatory scrutiny due to concerning trading patterns. Movement to Stage-II represents escalation of surveillance measures. These changes will result in:
- Increased compliance burden for affected companies
- Enhanced monitoring requirements for market participants
- Potential impact on liquidity for affected securities
- Stricter trading conditions including higher margins and position limits
