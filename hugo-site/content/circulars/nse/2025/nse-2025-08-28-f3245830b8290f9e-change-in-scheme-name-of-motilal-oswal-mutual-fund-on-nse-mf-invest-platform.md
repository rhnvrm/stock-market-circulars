title: Change in scheme name of Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund on NSE MF Invest platform
---

## Summary

NSE has informed members about a scheme name change for Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund effective August 29, 2025. The "Motilal Oswal Developed Market Ex US ETFs Fund of Funds" will be renamed to "Motilal Oswal Developed Market Ex US ETFs Overseas Equity Passive FOF" to align with SEBI's Fund of Fund framework issued in February 2025.

## Key Points

- Scheme name change effective August 29, 2025
- Change required to comply with SEBI's Fund of Fund framework
- Additional changes include benchmark modifications for Gold and Silver ETFs Fund of Funds
- Eligible underlying schemes list updated to include Motilal Oswal's own Gold and Silver ETFs

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI issued a framework for Fund of Fund schemes with multiple underlying funds in February 2025, with clarifications in June 2025. Existing FOF schemes investing in multiple underlying schemes must be re-categorized to align with this framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE MF Invest platform members to note the scheme name change
- Fund house to implement changes as per SEBI framework requirements
- Updated Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) to reflect changes

## Important Dates

- **August 29, 2025**: Effective date for scheme name change and other modifications

## Impact Assessment

Minimal impact expected as this is primarily an administrative change to comply with regulatory requirements. The underlying investment strategy and portfolio remain unchanged. Investors will see the new scheme name on their statements and platform displays from the effective date.
