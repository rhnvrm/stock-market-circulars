## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. These are routine further issue listings representing small percentages of existing share capital for each company. ESOP allotments are expected corporate actions that are typically factored into dilution calculations.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in tradable float for most companies. Embassy Developments has the largest addition (10.4 million shares) but with significant lock-in periods reducing immediate tradable supply.

**Investor Impact**: No immediate impact on existing shareholders. Shares are pari passu with existing equity, maintaining uniform rights across all equity holders.
