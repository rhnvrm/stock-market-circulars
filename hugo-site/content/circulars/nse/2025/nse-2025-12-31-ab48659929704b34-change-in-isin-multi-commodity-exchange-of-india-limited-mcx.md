---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has announced a change in the ISIN code for Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited (MCX) equity shares. The change is necessitated by a stock sub-division from face value Rs. 10/- to Rs. 2/-. The new ISIN INE745G01043 will become effective for all trades from January 02, 2026.

## Key Points

- Company affected: Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited (Symbol: MCX)
- New ISIN code: INE745G01043
- Reason: Stock sub-division from Rs. 10/- to Rs. 2/- face value
- Ex-date: January 02, 2026
- The new ISIN will apply to all trades executed on or after the ex-date

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a corporate action-related administrative change in the identification code for MCX equity shares following stock subdivision.

## Compliance Requirements

- Exchange members must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN code INE745G01043 for MCX shares
- All trading, clearing, and settlement systems must be configured to use the new ISIN from January 02, 2026
- Members should ensure their back-office systems are updated before the ex-date

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** December 31, 2025
- **Ex-Date (Effective Date):** January 02, 2026 - New ISIN becomes effective for all trades

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The ISIN change affects all market participants trading MCX shares. However, this is a standard corporate action with advance notice.

**Operational Impact:** Members need to ensure their trading and settlement systems are updated with the new ISIN code before January 02, 2026. The stock sub-division from Rs. 10 to Rs. 2 will increase the number of shares outstanding by 5x while reducing the share price proportionally, potentially improving liquidity and accessibility for retail investors.

**System Impact:** Trading systems, risk management systems, and back-office applications must be reconfigured to recognize the new ISIN code for seamless operations post-implementation.
