title: Cancellation of Shifting of Brightcom Group Limited to Z Category
---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange has decided not to proceed with shifting Brightcom Group Limited (Symbol: BCG) to Z Category (BZ Category) effective January 2, 2026. This cancels the earlier decision communicated via circular NSE/CML/71932 dated December 22, 2025, which had proposed the shift due to non-compliance with Regulation 76 of SEBI Depositories and Participants Regulations, 2018.

## Key Points

- Cancellation of Z Category shifting for Brightcom Group Limited (BCG)
- Original non-compliance: Failure to submit Reconciliation of Share Capital Audit Report for two consecutive quarters (June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025)
- Scheduled shift date of January 2, 2026 is now cancelled
- Regulation 76 of SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 2018 was cited as the basis for original action

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular cancels a previously announced enforcement action.

## Compliance Requirements

The cancellation suggests that Brightcom Group Limited has likely remedied its non-compliance with Regulation 76 by submitting the required Reconciliation of Share Capital Audit Reports for the quarters ended June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025.

## Important Dates

- **December 22, 2025**: Original circular (NSE/CML/71932) issued announcing Z Category shift
- **December 31, 2025**: Current circular issued cancelling the Z Category shift
- **January 2, 2026**: Previously scheduled effective date for Z Category shift (now cancelled)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Positive for Brightcom Group Limited shareholders. The cancellation prevents the stock from being placed in Z Category, which would have severely restricted trading and liquidity. Normal trading operations will continue.

**Compliance Signal**: The reversal indicates the company has rectified its compliance issues, demonstrating responsiveness to regulatory requirements and avoiding punitive categorization that could have negatively impacted investor sentiment and stock valuation.
