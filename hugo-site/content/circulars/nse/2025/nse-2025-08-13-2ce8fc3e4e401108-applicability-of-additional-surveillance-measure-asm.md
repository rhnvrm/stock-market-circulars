## Summary

NSE has implemented Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (Long Term - ASM) framework affecting securities that meet specific criteria. The measure includes increased margin requirements and potential segment shifts for enhanced market surveillance.

## Key Points

- 100% margin requirement applicable on all positions effective August 19, 2025
- Jayaswal Neco Industries Limited (JAYNECOIND) included in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- Securities under criteria VII will shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ) to Trade-for-Trade (BE) segment
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other existing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance, not adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework
- Margin rate increased to 100% for securities under ASM
- Segment classification changes for qualifying securities from EQ to BE series
- Enhanced surveillance monitoring for identified securities

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain 100% margin on ASM securities from August 19, 2025
- Compliance with new position requirements for both existing and new positions
- Adherence to Trade-for-Trade segment rules for securities shifted from Rolling Settlement
- Members must note the applicable surveillance actions and framework provisions

## Important Dates

- **August 13, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **August 14, 2025**: Effective date for ASM framework implementation
- **August 18, 2025**: Last day for existing positions under current margin requirements
- **August 19, 2025**: 100% margin requirement and segment shifts become effective

## Impact Assessment

- **Market Impact**: Enhanced surveillance may affect price discovery and volatility
- **Investor Impact**: Higher capital commitment required for positions in ASM securities
