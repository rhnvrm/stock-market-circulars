## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and traders of these specific non-convertible debt securities. The suspension is procedural and relates to the natural lifecycle events of these debt instruments (redemption and call option exercise). Equity shares of Bank of Baroda and Union Bank of India remain unaffected. Investors holding these debt securities should expect redemption proceedings as per the terms of issuance. No broader market disruption is anticipated as this is a routine administrative action for maturing or called debt instruments.
