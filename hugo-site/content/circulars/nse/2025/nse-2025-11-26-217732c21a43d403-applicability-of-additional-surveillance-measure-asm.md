---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) has issued a surveillance circular placing three securities under the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (Long-Term ASM) Framework Stage-I, effective November 27, 2025. A 100% margin requirement will be applicable on all open positions as of November 28, 2025, and on new positions created from December 1, 2025 onwards. This measure is part of NSE's ongoing market surveillance framework to monitor securities exhibiting specific risk characteristics.

## Key Points

- Three securities shortlisted under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I effective November 27, 2025
- 100% margin requirement applicable from December 1, 2025
- Margin applies to both existing open positions (as on November 28, 2025) and new positions from December 1, 2025
- No securities moved to Stage-IV (Trade-for-Trade segment) in this circular
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Securities under ASM: AMBANI ORGOCHEM LIMITED (AMBANIORGO), Net Avenue Technologies Limited (CBAZAAR), and SVP GLOBAL TEXTILES LIMITED (SVPGLOB)
- No securities progressed from Stage-I to Stage-II, Stage-II to Stage-III, or Stage-I to Stage-IV

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (Long-Term ASM) framework as per previous circulars dated October 27, 2018, July 22, 2020, December 04, 2020, June 04, 2021, April 22, 2022, August 09, 2024, and September 20, 2024.

The key regulatory action is the application of 100% margin on the three identified securities. Securities qualifying under Criteria VII at Stage-IV would be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE), though no securities met this criteria in the current circular.

## Compliance Requirements

**For NSE Members:**
- Ensure 100% margin collection on all open positions in the three identified securities as on November 28, 2025
- Apply 100% margin on all new positions created from December 1, 2025 onwards
- Comply with all other prevailing surveillance measures concurrently
- Monitor client positions in affected securities

**For Investors/Traders:**
- Maintain adequate margins (100%) for positions in AMBANIORGO, CBAZAAR, and SVPGLOB

2. **CBAZAAR** - Net Avenue Technologies Limited (ISIN: INE518X01015)
