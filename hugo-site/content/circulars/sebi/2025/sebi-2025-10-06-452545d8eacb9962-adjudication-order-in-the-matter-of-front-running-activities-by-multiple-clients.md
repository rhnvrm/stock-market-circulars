## Impact Assessment

This enforcement action demonstrates SEBI's continued focus on detecting and penalizing front running violations, particularly those involving dealers who misuse client information. The case involves a systematic scheme where a dealer allegedly exploited his position over a 4-year period using multiple family accounts. While the direct market impact is limited to specific individuals and one client group (Eastman Group), it serves as a deterrent for similar violations and reinforces the importance of maintaining information barriers and ethical trading practices. The involvement of family members highlights SEBI's approach of pursuing all parties who facilitate fraudulent trading activities.
