## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority rejected Appeal No. 6581 of 2025 filed by Naveen Bhatnagar under the Right to Information Act, 2005. The appellant sought information on vanishing companies, FIRs lodged against them, details of associated intermediaries, and enforcement actions taken by SEBI. The CPIO's response denying the information was upheld as the requested data is not available or maintained by SEBI in the specified format.

## Key Points

- Original RTI application filed on August 25, 2025, seeking information on approximately 14,222 vanishing companies identified as of December 12, 2000
- CPIO responded on September 12, 2025, stating information not available with SEBI
- Appeal filed on September 29, 2025 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00265)
- Appellate Authority upheld CPIO's response citing that RTI Act provides access only to existing information
- Supreme Court precedent in Central Board of Secondary Education vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay applied

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an administrative order on an RTI appeal.

## Compliance Requirements

- September 12, 2025: CPIO response provided
- September 29, 2025: Appeal filed
