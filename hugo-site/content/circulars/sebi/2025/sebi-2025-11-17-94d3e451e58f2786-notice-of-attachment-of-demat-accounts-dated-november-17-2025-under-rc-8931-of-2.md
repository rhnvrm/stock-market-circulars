## Important Dates

- **November 17, 2025**: Date of issuance of notice of attachment of demat accounts

## Impact Assessment

**For Anup Karwa**: High impact - inability to access or transact in attached demat accounts until recovery proceedings conclude. This represents a significant enforcement action that restricts the individual's ability to deal with securities held in the affected accounts.

**For Market Participants**: Limited direct impact, but serves as a reminder of SEBI's enforcement capabilities in recovery proceedings.

**For Setubandhan Infrastructure Limited (formerly Prakash Constrowell Limited)**: The company's connection to this enforcement action may affect its reputation, though the primary target is the individual party.

**Precedent Value**: Demonstrates SEBI's use of demat account attachment as an effective tool for recovery in enforcement cases, particularly in matters involving listed companies.
