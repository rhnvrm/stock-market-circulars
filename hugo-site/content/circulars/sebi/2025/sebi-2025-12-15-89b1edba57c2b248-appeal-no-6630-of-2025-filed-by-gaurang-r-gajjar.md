## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6630 of 2025 filed by Gaurang R Gajjar under the Right to Information Act, 2005. The appellant sought information on how to claim his Rs. 20,000 investment in PACL Limited (Certificate No. U00546XXX dated August 26, 2013). SEBI's CPIO informed that the requested information is not available with SEBI, and the appellant was directed to publicly available resources on SEBI's website regarding PACL matters.

## Key Points

- Appellant Gaurang R Gajjar filed RTI application on November 6, 2025 regarding PACL Limited investment claim
- Investment amount: Rs. 20,000 (Certificate No. U00546XXX dated August 26, 2013) in name of Umangi Gaurang Gaurang
- CPIO responded on November 14, 2025 stating information not available with SEBI
- Appeal filed on November 24, 2025 claiming incomplete/misleading information
- Appeal dismissed on December 12, 2025 by Appellate Authority Ruchi Chojer
- Responsibility for property disposal and investor repayment lies with Justice (Retd.) R. M. Lodha Committee

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced by this order.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. The order reiterates that:
- PACL-related investor claims should be directed to the Justice R. M. Lodha Committee (constituted under Supreme Court order dated February 2, 2016)
- Investors should refer to Status Reports, FAQs, Press Releases and Public Notices on SEBI website for PACL matters

## Important Dates

- November 6, 2025: RTI application filed
- November 14, 2025: CPIO response issued
- November 24, 2025: Appeal filed (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00304)
- December 12, 2025: Appeal dismissed
- August 26, 2013: Original PACL investment certificate date
- February 2, 2016: Supreme Court order constituting Justice R. M. Lodha Committee

## Impact Assessment

This order has minimal market impact as it pertains to an individual RTI appeal regarding a historical PACL investment. The dismissal affirms that SEBI does not hold information regarding individual PACL investor claims, and such matters are under the jurisdiction of the Justice R. M. Lodha Committee appointed by the Supreme Court. The order serves as guidance for other PACL investors seeking information through RTI, directing them to publicly available resources and the appropriate authority for claims.
