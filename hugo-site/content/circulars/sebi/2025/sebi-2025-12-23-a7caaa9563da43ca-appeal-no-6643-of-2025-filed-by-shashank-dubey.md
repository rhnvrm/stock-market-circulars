---

## Summary

The Appellate Authority under the Right to Information Act, 2005 issued a decision on Appeal No. 6643 of 2025 filed by Shashank Dubey against the CPIO, SEBI, Mumbai. The appeal relates to an RTI application dated October 21, 2025 seeking information about a Vedanta Scam Report complaint submitted to SEBI on April 21, 2025. The respondent CPIO partially addressed the queries, confirming receipt of the complaint but refusing to disclose investigation details, officer information, and internal communications citing exemptions under Section 8(1)(h) and 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act.

## Key Points

- Appellant Shashank Dubey filed RTI application on October 21, 2025 seeking 10 specific pieces of information about his Vedanta Scam Report complaint
- Original complaint was submitted to SEBI via email on April 21, 2025
- CPIO responded on November 19, 2025, providing limited information
- Appeal filed on November 29, 2025 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00316)
- SEBI confirmed receipt of the April 21, 2025 email complaint
- Information about assigned officers refused under Section 8(1)(j) - personal information exemption
- Investigation details, internal communications, and action taken reports refused under Section 8(1)(h) - exemption for matters that would impede investigation process
- SEBI stated examinations and investigations are conducted confidentially and enforcement orders are published on SEBI website post-investigation when violations are established

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is an administrative decision on RTI information disclosure.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. The decision pertains to SEBI's RTI disclosure obligations and exemptions under the Right to Information Act, 2005.

## Important Dates

- April 21, 2025: Original Vedanta Scam Report complaint submitted to SEBI
- October 21, 2025: RTI application filed by Shashank Dubey
- November 19, 2025: CPIO response to RTI application
- November 29, 2025: Appeal filed with Appellate Authority
- December 23, 2025: Appeal decision issued (document date)

## Impact Assessment

This decision has minimal market impact as it relates to procedural RTI matters rather than substantive enforcement or regulatory actions. The decision upholds SEBI's position that ongoing investigation details are exempt from RTI disclosure to avoid impeding the examination process. The appeal confirms that:

1. SEBI maintains confidentiality of ongoing investigations under Section 8(1)(h) of RTI Act
2. Personal information of investigating officers is protected under Section 8(1)(j)
3. Enforcement actions and orders are made public only after completion of investigations

For Vedanta Limited and its investors, this indicates that a complaint regarding alleged scam has been received by SEBI and is under examination, but provides no details on investigation status, findings, or timeline. Market participants should monitor SEBI's website for any future enforcement orders related to Vedanta Limited.
