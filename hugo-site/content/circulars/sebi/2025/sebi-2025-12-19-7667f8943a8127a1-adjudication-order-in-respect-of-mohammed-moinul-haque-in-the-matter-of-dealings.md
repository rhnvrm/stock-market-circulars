title: Adjudication Order Against Mohammed Moinul Haque for Illiquid Stock Options
  Manipulation on BSE
---

## Summary

SEBI issued an adjudication order (Order/JS/DP/2025-26/31891) against Mohammed Moinul Haque (PAN: AASPH2967H) for executing non-genuine reversal trades in illiquid stock options on BSE during April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015. The investigation revealed that 2,91,643 trades comprising 81.38% of all trades in BSE's stock options segment were reversal trades involving entities reversing their buy/sell positions with the same counterparty. These trades created artificial volumes and false appearance of trading activity. Mohammed Moinul Haque was among 14,720 entities identified for such violations and was charged with violating SEBI PFUTP Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a).

## Key Points

## Compliance Requirements

- Executing reversal trades with same counterparties in illiquid stock options
- Creating artificial volumes through non-genuine trades
- Engaging in manipulative and deceptive trading practices
- Creating false or misleading appearance of trading activity

## Important Dates

- Investigation Period: April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015

## Impact Assessment

This is an individual enforcement case with limited market-wide impact. The order addresses historical violations from 2014-2015 in illiquid stock options segment on BSE. While the practice affected 81.38% of trades in that segment during the investigation period, the trading was in illiquid options with minimal broader market impact. The case is part of SEBI's systematic action against 14,720 entities involved in similar manipulation, demonstrating regulatory vigilance in detecting and penalizing artificial volume creation. Impact is primarily deterrent in nature for similar future violations.
