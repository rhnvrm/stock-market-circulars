## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Limited current market impact as this relates to historical violations from 2014-2015. However, it demonstrates SEBI's continued vigilance against market manipulation in derivatives segments.

**Regulatory Impact:** Reinforces SEBI's enforcement of PFUTP Regulations against creation of artificial volumes through reversal trades, particularly in illiquid stock options where such manipulation is easier to execute.

**Operational Impact:** Serves as a deterrent for market participants considering similar manipulative practices. The significant finding that 81.40% of trades in the stock options segment during the investigation period were non-genuine highlights the scale of manipulation that occurred and SEBI's commitment to addressing such violations even years after occurrence.
