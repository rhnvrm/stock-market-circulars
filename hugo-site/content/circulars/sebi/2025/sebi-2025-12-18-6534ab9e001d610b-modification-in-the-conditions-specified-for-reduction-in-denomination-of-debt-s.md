## Summary

SEBI has modified the conditions for reduction in denomination of debt securities under the NCS Master Circular dated October 15, 2025. The key change allows zero coupon debt securities to be issued at a reduced face value of Rs. Ten Thousand on private placement basis, previously restricted to only interest/dividend bearing securities. This amendment addresses market feedback that zero coupon instruments, which are issued at discount and redeemed at par, provide attractive compounded returns for investors without interim payouts.

## Key Points

- Zero coupon debt securities now eligible for reduced denomination of Rs. Ten Thousand
- Previously only interest/dividend bearing securities qualified for reduced face value
- Zero coupon securities must have fixed maturity without structured obligations
- Amendment modifies Clause 1.3 of Chapter V of NCS Master Circular dated October 15, 2025
- Applies to debt securities and non-convertible redeemable preference shares issued on private placement basis
- Zero coupon bonds are issued at discount and redeemed at par, providing compounded returns

## Regulatory Changes

Clause 1.3 of Chapter V of the NCS Master Circular dated October 15, 2025 has been partially modified. The updated condition now reads:

**Previous Requirement:**
- Debt securities/NCRPS at Rs. Ten Thousand face value must be interest/dividend bearing securities paying coupon/dividend at regular intervals with fixed maturity without structured obligations

**Modified Requirement:**
- Such securities shall be interest/dividend bearing paying coupon/dividend at regular intervals with fixed maturity without structured obligations; **OR**
- It shall be a zero coupon debt security with fixed maturity, without any structured obligations

This change references the original circular SEBI/HO/DDHS/DDHS-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/94 dated July 03, 2024 which first provided for reduction in denomination of debt securities.
