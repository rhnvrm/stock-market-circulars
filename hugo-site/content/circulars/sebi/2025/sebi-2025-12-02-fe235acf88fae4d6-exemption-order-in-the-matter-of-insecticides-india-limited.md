## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is an internal promoter group restructuring involving transfer of shares to family trusts. The shares remain within the promoter group, and there is no change in ultimate beneficial ownership or control.

**Operational Impact:** The restructuring through family trusts indicates succession planning and estate management by the promoter group. This provides long-term stability and structured ownership framework.

**Investor Impact:** Minimal impact on public shareholders as this is a promoter group internal reorganization that does not trigger an open offer requirement. The exemption maintains the status quo for minority shareholders.
