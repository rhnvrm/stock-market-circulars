## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is an individual enforcement action against one participant in a historical manipulation scheme from 2014-2015. The broader investigation covered 14,720 entities, and this represents closure of one case among thousands.

**Regulatory Significance**: Demonstrates SEBI's continued enforcement against market manipulation even for cases dating back several years. Reinforces zero-tolerance policy for creation of artificial volumes and false trading activity.
