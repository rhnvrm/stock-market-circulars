title: Ease of investments and ease of doing business measures – enhancing the 'Facility
  for Basic Services Demat Account (BSDA)'
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued this circular to enhance the Basic Services Demat Account (BSDA) facility to promote ease of investments and ease of doing business. The key changes include excluding Zero Coupon Zero Principal (ZCZP) bonds and delisted securities from threshold calculations, valuing illiquid securities at last closing price, requiring quarterly reassessment of BSDA eligibility by Depository Participants (DPs), and mandating active consent from beneficiary owners to avail or continue regular demat accounts. These provisions will come into force from March 31, 2026.

## Key Points

- Zero Coupon Zero Principal (ZCZP) bonds excluded from BSDA threshold reckoning
- Delisted securities excluded from BSDA threshold calculation
- Illiquid securities to be valued at last closing price for BSDA threshold
- DPs must reassess BSDA eligibility every quarter (changed from earlier frequency)
- Active consent required from beneficial owners through verifiable channels to avail/continue regular demat accounts
- DPs must open only BSDA for eligible accounts unless BOs specifically consent to regular demat account
- Suspended securities, delisted securities, and ZCZP bonds not considered for determining BSDA eligibility
- Supersedes specific paragraphs 2.2(a), 2.2(b) and 2.3(c) of circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-PoD1/P/CIR/2024/91 dated June 28, 2024

## Regulatory Changes

**Modified Para 2.2(a):** DPs shall open only BSDA for eligible Beneficial Owners unless such BOs specifically provide consent through authenticated and verifiable channel to avail regular demat account facility.

**Modified Para 2.2(b):** DPs shall reassess eligibility of all existing BOs for BSDA at end of every quarter and convert eligible demat accounts into BSDA unless BOs provide consent through authenticated and verifiable channel (as specified by Depositories) to continue regular demat account.

**Modified Para 2.3(c):** Value of holding shall be determined based on:
- Daily closing price or NAV of securities/mutual fund units
- Last traded price if closing price unavailable
- Face value for unlisted securities (other than mutual fund units)
- Last closing price for illiquid securities
- Suspended securities, delisted securities, and ZCZP bonds excluded from BSDA eligibility determination

## Impact Assessment

- Quarterly reassessment ensures timely conversion of eligible accounts to BSDA
- Active consent requirement protects investors from inadvertent account type changes

**Depository Participant Impact:**
- Operational burden of quarterly reassessment instead of less frequent reviews
- System changes required to implement modified valuation methodology

- 90-day implementation timeline provides reasonable time for system upgrades
