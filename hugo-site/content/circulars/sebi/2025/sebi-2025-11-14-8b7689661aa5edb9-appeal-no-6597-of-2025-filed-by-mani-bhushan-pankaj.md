## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6597 of 2025 filed by Mani Bhushan Pankaj under the Right to Information Act, 2005. The appellant sought certified copies of shareholding patterns, board resolutions, audited financial statements, and other information related to Delhi Stock Exchange Ltd. (DSE) and DSE Financial Services Ltd. (DSSL) from FY 2009-10 onwards. SEBI's CPIO responded that the requested information is not maintained by SEBI in the normal course of regulation and is therefore not available. The Appellate Authority upheld this response, citing Supreme Court precedent that RTI does not require public authorities to collect information not already maintained in their records.

No operational or compliance implications for market participants.
