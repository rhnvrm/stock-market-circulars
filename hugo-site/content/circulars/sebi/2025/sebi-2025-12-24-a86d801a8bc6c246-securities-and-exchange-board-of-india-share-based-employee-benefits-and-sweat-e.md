- Covers schemes that involve direct or indirect dealing in company securities for employee benefit
- Applies when schemes are set up, funded, guaranteed, controlled or managed by the company or group companies
- Preferential issue provisions under SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2018 do not apply except where specifically provided
- Came into force on date of publication in Official Gazette (August 13, 2021)
- Most recent amendment effective December 4, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The regulations consolidate the framework for six types of schemes:

1. **Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOP)** - Options granted to employees to purchase shares
2. **Employee Stock Purchase Schemes (ESPS)** - Direct purchase programs for employees
3. **Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR)** - Rights to receive appreciation between exercise/vesting date market price and SAR price
4. **General Employee Benefits Schemes** - Broader benefit programs involving securities
5. **Retirement Benefit Schemes** - Retirement-linked equity benefits
6. **Sweat Equity Shares** - Equity issued for intellectual property or know-how contributions

The regulations establish that schemes are covered if they satisfy any one of three conditions: (a) set up by the company or group company, (b) funded or guaranteed by the company or group company, or (c) controlled or managed by the company or group company.

**Operational Impact:**

- Trust structures used for employee benefits must meet regulatory criteria for setup, funding, and control
- SAR schemes now have clear regulatory definition and framework

**Compliance Burden:**
Companies must review existing schemes for compliance with the consolidated framework and implement any changes required by the December 4, 2025 amendments. The regulations provide clarity but require detailed disclosure and governance standards.

**Strategic Implications:**
The comprehensive framework enables listed companies to design competitive employee compensation packages while maintaining regulatory compliance, supporting talent attraction and retention in Indian capital markets.
