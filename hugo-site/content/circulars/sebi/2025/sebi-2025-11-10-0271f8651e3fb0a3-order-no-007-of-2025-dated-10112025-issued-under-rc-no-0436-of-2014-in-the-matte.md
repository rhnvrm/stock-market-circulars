## Impact Assessment

**Investors**: Significant impact on investors of Four Season Farms Limited who are owed Rs. 15.20 crore plus assured returns and interest. The ongoing recovery proceedings demonstrate SEBI's commitment to investor protection, though recovery timeline has extended over two decades.

**Company and Directors**: Severe operational impact with all properties under prohibitory order. Directors Jitendra Hiralal Mehtra and Pravinchandra Hiralal Mehtra face continued enforcement action. Properties frozen include 17 Mumbai flats, 252+ acres agricultural land, and commercial assets.

**Market**: Limited broader market impact as this is an entity-specific enforcement action. However, serves as precedent for SEBI's persistent pursuit of recovery even after extended periods, reinforcing deterrence against CIS violations.

**Legal Precedent**: Demonstrates effectiveness of recovery mechanisms under Section 28A of SEBI Act and coordination with Income-Tax Act provisions for asset attachment and recovery.
