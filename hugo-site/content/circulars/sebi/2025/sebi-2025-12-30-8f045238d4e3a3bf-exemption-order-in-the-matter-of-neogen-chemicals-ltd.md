## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low. This is an internal restructuring of promoter shareholding into family trust structures without change in ultimate beneficial ownership or control. No dilution of public shareholding.

**Shareholder Impact:** Minimal impact on public shareholders. Promoter group holding remains at 51.23%. This is a succession planning and estate management exercise by the Kanani family.

**Regulatory Significance:** Demonstrates SEBI's approach to granting exemptions for bona fide family restructuring under Regulation 11(5) of SAST Regulations where there is no change in control or prejudice to public shareholders.

**Operational Impact:** No change to company operations or management. Family trusts facilitate smoother succession planning and wealth management for promoter families while maintaining control structure.
