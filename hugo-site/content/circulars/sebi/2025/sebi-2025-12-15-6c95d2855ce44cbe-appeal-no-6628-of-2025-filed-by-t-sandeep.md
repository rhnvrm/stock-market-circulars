## Summary

This order pertains to Appeal No. 6628 of 2025 filed by T Sandeep under the Right to Information Act, 2005, seeking information regarding age relaxation policies for serving Central Government employees applying to SEBI positions. The appellant's RTI application dated October 30, 2025 requested details on rules, guidelines, service requirements, probation clearance requirements, HR circulars, and correspondence with Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT). The CPIO responded on November 20, 2025, and the appellant filed an appeal on November 21, 2025. The Appellate Authority dismissed the appeal, concurring that the queries were vague and non-specific, and therefore not disclosable under Section 2(f) of the RTI Act.

## Key Points

- RTI application filed on October 30, 2025, seeking six categories of information on age relaxation policies
- CPIO response dated November 20, 2025 rejected most queries as vague, non-specific, or seeking clarification/opinion
- For ongoing SEBI Recruitment 2025 of Grade A officers, applicant was directed to page 4 of the advertisement for age relaxation details
- Appeal filed on November 21, 2025 on grounds of refusal of access to information
- Appellate Authority cited CIC precedent from Mr. T. V. Sundaresan vs. CPIO case (November 24, 2021) regarding requirement for specific and documented information
- Appeal dismissed as queries 1, 2, 5, and 6 were deemed vague and non-specific under RTI Act framework
- Queries 3 and 4 were rejected as seeking clarification/opinion rather than information as defined under Section 2(f) of RTI Act
