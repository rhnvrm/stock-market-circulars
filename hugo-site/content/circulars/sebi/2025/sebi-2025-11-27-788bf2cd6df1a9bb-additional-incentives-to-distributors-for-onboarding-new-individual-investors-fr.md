title: Additional incentives to distributors for onboarding new individual investors
  from B-30 cities and women investors
---

## Summary

SEBI has revised the incentive structure for mutual fund distributors through amendments to Regulation 52 of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations 1996. The previous framework under Regulation 52(6A)(b) has been deleted due to concerns of misuse. A new commission structure has been introduced under Regulation 52(4A) to encourage distributors to onboard new individual investors from B-30 cities and new women investors from all cities. The additional commission will be funded from the 2 basis points on daily net assets mandated for investor education and financial inclusion initiatives.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Expected to expand mutual fund penetration in B-30 cities and among women investors
- Standardized commission structure may reduce misuse compared to previous framework
- Could increase competition among distributors to onboard new investors from target segments

**Operational Impact:**
- AMCs need to modify commission tracking and payment systems to identify eligible new investors
- Implementation of claw back mechanisms required for cases where investors exit before 1 year
- RTAs and AMCs need to track PAN-level data at industry level to identify truly new investors
- Changes to offer documents required but streamlined as not considered Fundamental Attribute Change

**Financial Impact:**
- Additional commission capped at ₹2,000 per eligible new investor
- Funded from existing investor education corpus (2 basis points on daily net assets), not from scheme expense ratios
- No impact on existing trail commission structure
- Exclusion of ETFs, certain FoFs, and short-duration schemes limits scope

**Inclusion Impact:**
- Incentivizes distributor focus on underserved segments (B-30 cities, women investors)
- Aligns distributor incentives with financial inclusion objectives
- May accelerate awareness and participation in mutual funds among target demographics
