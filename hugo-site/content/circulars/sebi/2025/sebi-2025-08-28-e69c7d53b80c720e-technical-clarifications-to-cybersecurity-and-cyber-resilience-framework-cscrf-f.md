## Summary

SEBI has issued technical clarifications to the Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) originally released in August 2024. This circular addresses queries from regulated entities and provides specific guidance for entities operating under multiple regulatory jurisdictions, along with re-categorization of certain entity types and technical implementation details.

## Key Points

- Technical clarifications provided in four parts: principles for multi-regulator entities, technical clarifications, re-categorization of Portfolio Managers and Merchant Bankers, and CERT-In audit policy guidelines
- Special provisions for SEBI regulated entities that are also regulated by other authorities like RBI (e.g., custodians, depository participants, merchant bankers who are also banks)
- References five previous circulars and FAQs issued between August 2024 and June 2025 providing extensions and clarifications
- Applies to all major categories of SEBI regulated entities including AIFs, stock exchanges, mutual funds, brokers, depositories, and rating agencies
