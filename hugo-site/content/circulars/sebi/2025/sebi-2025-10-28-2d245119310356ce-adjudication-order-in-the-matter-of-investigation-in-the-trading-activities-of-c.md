## Compliance Requirements

- Entities acquiring shares that result in crossing 5% threshold (individually or as a group) must make timely disclosures as per Regulation 29 of SAST Regulations
- Disclosure obligations apply when acting in concert or as a group, even if individual holdings are below threshold
- Market participants must maintain proper records of share acquisitions and monitor cumulative holdings to ensure compliance
- Failure to disclose attracts penalties under Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act, 1992

## Important Dates

- Investigation Period: October 13, 2022 to April 25, 2023

- Third violation date: February 23, 2023
- Adjudicating Officer appointment: May 02, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This enforcement action demonstrates SEBI's continued focus on ensuring transparency in substantial acquisition disclosures. The case highlights that entities acting as a group are collectively responsible for disclosure obligations even if individual shareholdings appear below thresholds. Investors and market participants acquiring significant stakes must ensure timely compliance with SAST regulations to avoid penalties. The order serves as a deterrent and reinforces the importance of disclosure norms in maintaining market integrity and protecting investor interests. Companies and promoters should review their shareholding patterns and disclosure practices to ensure compliance.
