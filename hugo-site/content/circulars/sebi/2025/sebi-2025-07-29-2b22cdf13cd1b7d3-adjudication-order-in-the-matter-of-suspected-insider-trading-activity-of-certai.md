title: Adjudication Order Against Rupesh Satish Dalal HUF for Insider Trading in HDFC
  Limited and HDFC Bank Limited
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued an adjudication order against Rupesh Satish Dalal HUF for alleged insider trading violations in HDFC Limited and HDFC Bank Limited scrips. The violations occurred prior to the April 4, 2022 announcement of HDFC Ltd.'s merger into HDFC Bank Ltd. The entity allegedly traded on unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) obtained through intermediaries, violating PIT Regulations.

## Key Points

- HDFC Ltd. and HDFC Bank Ltd. announced merger on April 4, 2022 at 8:56 AM before market hours
- HDFC Bank's share price rose 10.01% and HDFC Ltd. rose 9.29% on announcement day
- NSE identified suspicious trading patterns by Rupesh Satish Dalal HUF prior to announcement
- Investigation period: November 1, 2021 to April 30, 2022
- UPSI allegedly passed from insider Mr. X to Mr. Y, then to Rupesh Satish Dalal (karta of HUF)
- Mr. X and Mr. Y filed settlement applications and settled via order dated December 20, 2024
- New Adjudicating Officer appointed on April 8, 2025 due to superannuation of previous officer

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. Case reinforces existing insider trading prohibitions under PIT Regulations 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- Entities must ensure no trading on unpublished price sensitive information
- Compliance with regulations 3(2) and 4(1) of PIT Regulations 2015
- Adherence to sections 12A(d) and (e) of SEBI Act 1992
- Proper disclosure and prevention of UPSI misuse in corporate transactions

## Important Dates

- April 4, 2022: HDFC merger announcement
- Investigation Period: November 1, 2021 to April 30, 2022
- December 20, 2024: Settlement order for Mr. X and Mr. Y
- April 8, 2025: New Adjudicating Officer appointment

## Impact Assessment

The case demonstrates SEBI's continued vigilance against insider trading in major corporate transactions. The HDFC merger was one of the largest banking sector consolidations, making this enforcement action significant for market integrity. While the immediate parties Mr. X and Mr. Y have settled, the adjudication against the HUF reinforces consequences for downstream recipients of UPSI.
