SEBI's Appellate Authority under the RTI Act dismissed three appeals (Nos. 6555, 6557 & 6578 of 2025) filed by Syed Abdul Rahman on October 09, 2025. The appeals were dismissed as they were found to be repetitive in nature, addressing the same subject matter as a previous application (Reg. No. SEBIH/R/E/25/01078) dated August 16, 2025, for which an FAA Order had already been passed on October 09, 2025.
