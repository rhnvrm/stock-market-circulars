## Summary

Appeal No. 6549 of 2025 filed by K. Siva under the Right to Information Act, 2005 has been dismissed by the Appellate Authority. The appellant sought 5 years (2019-20 to 2023-24) spot and future market data for NCDEX agriculture commodities. SEBI's CPIO responded that SEBI does not maintain data on commodities market. The Appellate Authority upheld this response, citing Supreme Court precedent that RTI Act provides access only to existing information and does not obligate public authorities to collect or collate non-available information.
