## Compliance Requirements

- **Immediate Payment Required**: Amit Gangrade must pay Rs. 6,66,000/- within 15 days of receipt
- **Property Transfer Restrictions**: The entity cannot mortgage, charge, lease, or deal with any property without Recovery Officer permission (Rule 16 of Second Schedule to Income Tax Act)
- **Deemed Property Clause**: Any direct/indirect transfer of property or money to spouse, minor child, son's wife, or son's minor child after April 26, 2023 without adequate consideration will be deemed as entity's property for recovery purposes
- **Payment Confirmation**: Payment confirmation must be sent to Recovery Officer at SEBI Bhavan-II with complete transaction details (case name, RC number, payee name, date, amount, transaction number, bank details)

## Important Dates

- **Original Penalty Date**: April 26, 2023 (QJA Order)
- **Notice Date**: December 12, 2025
- **Payment Deadline**: 15 days from receipt of notice
- **Interest Period**: April 2023 to December 2025 (32 months at 1% per month)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Nil. This is an individual enforcement action with no systemic market implications.

**Entity Impact**: High severity for Amit Gangrade personally. Non-compliance will trigger coercive recovery measures including:
- Attachment and sale of movable/immovable property
- Freezing of bank accounts
- Potential arrest and detention
- Appointment of receiver for property management

**Operational Impact**: The entity's ability to conduct business may be severely restricted due to property dealing restrictions and potential asset attachment. This serves as a precedent demonstrating SEBI's commitment to enforcing penalties and collecting dues from non-compliant investment research advisors.
