## Summary

SEBI has issued a corrigendum to its Confirmatory Order dated December 30, 2025 (reference number WTM/KV/CFID/CFID-TPD/31942/2025-26) in the matter of Pacheli Industrial Finance Limited. The corrigendum corrects a date mentioned in paragraph 40, page 17 of the original order from "May 14, 2025" to "January 16, 2025".

## Key Points

- Corrigendum issued by Whole Time Member Kamlesh C. Varshney
- Correction applies to order reference number WTM/KV/CFID/CFID-TPD/31942/2025-26
- Date correction in paragraph 40, page 17: "May 14, 2025" changed to "January 16, 2025"
- Corrigendum to be served upon all Noticees, Stock Exchanges, Registrar and Transfer Agents, and Depositories

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a technical correction to an existing order.

## Compliance Requirements

- All Noticees must take note of the corrected date
- Stock Exchanges, Registrar and Transfer Agents, and Depositories must ensure necessary compliance with the corrected order

## Important Dates

- **December 31, 2025**: Date of corrigendum issuance
- **December 30, 2025**: Date of original confirmatory order
- **January 16, 2025**: Corrected date (previously stated as May 14, 2025)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal impact as this is purely an administrative correction to fix a typographical error in a previously issued order. The correction does not alter the substance of the enforcement action against Pacheli Industrial Finance Limited, only corrects a date reference for accuracy.
