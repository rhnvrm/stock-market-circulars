## Summary

SEBI issued a settlement order (SO/PSD/2025-26/8433) against Atul Gopeshwar Chaturvedi, a sales trader at Antique Stock Broking Limited, for front-running trades of Big Client Societe Generale. During the investigation period from January 1, 2022 to December 8, 2023, Chaturvedi misused material non-public information about impending client trades, transmitting it to family members and friends who earned wrongful gains of ₹1,23,28,165. The settlement was approved without admission or denial of violations.

## Key Points

- Violations of Sections 12A(a), 12A(b), 12A(c) and 12A(e) of SEBI Act, 1992
- Violations of PFUTP Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(q) read with Regulation 2(1)(c)

- Wrongful gains to family members and friends: ₹1,23,28,165
- Chaturvedi also front-ran trades using his brother-in-law's trading account
- Settlement approved by HPAC on July 3, 2025 and Panel of Whole Time Members in September

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This order enforces existing provisions under:
- SEBI Act, 1992 (Sections 12A)
- SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003
- SEBI (Settlement Proceedings) Regulations, 2018

## Compliance Requirements

**For Atul Gopeshwar Chaturvedi:**
- Pay monetary settlement amount of ₹96,00,000 (Rupees Ninety Six Lakhs)
- Pay disgorgement of ₹1,48,15,631 (Rupees One Crore Forty Eight Lakhs Fifteen Thousand Six Hundred Thirty One)
- Accept voluntary debarment from buying, selling or dealing in securities, either directly or indirectly, for 6 months from the date of settlement order
- Settlement on "neither admit nor deny" basis

**For Market Intermediaries:**
- Reinforces need for robust information barriers and surveillance mechanisms
- Emphasizes compliance with insider trading and front-running prevention protocols
- Highlights importance of monitoring sales traders with access to client order information

## Important Dates

- **Investigation Period:** January 1, 2022 to December 8, 2023
- **Internal Committee Meeting:** May 9, 2025
- **Revised Settlement Terms Filed:** May 28, 2025
- **HPAC Recommendation:** July 3, 2025
- **Panel Approval:** September 2025 (specific date not mentioned in excerpt)
- **6-Month Debarment:** Commences from date of settlement order

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - This case demonstrates SEBI's vigilance in detecting and prosecuting front-running activities, particularly those involving intermediaries with access to material non-public information. The settlement reinforces market integrity standards.

**Operational Impact:** This order serves as a warning to sales traders and market intermediaries about misuse of client information. Brokerages should strengthen internal controls, implement stricter information barriers between client-facing staff and proprietary trading, and enhance surveillance systems to detect unusual trading patterns among employees and their associates.

**Precedent Value:** The settlement terms combining monetary penalties (₹96 lakhs), disgorgement (₹1.48 crore exceeding actual gains), and 6-month debarment establish a benchmark for similar front-running cases. The fact that 348 out of 350 instances involved the same sales trader highlights the systematic nature of the violation and effectiveness of SEBI's pattern detection capabilities.
