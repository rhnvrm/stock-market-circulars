## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Limited direct market impact as this is an internal promoter group restructuring through trust vehicles rather than a change in ultimate control. The exemption prevents mandatory open offer requirements that would otherwise apply.

**Operational Impact:** The acquisition involves transfer of shares from individual promoters (Suneeti Agarwal, Sunil Agarwal, and Santanu Agarwal) to trust structures. This represents a reorganization of promoter holdings rather than dilution or change in management control.

**Investor Impact:** Public shareholders (58.84% of total shareholding) are not required to receive an open offer, as SEBI has granted exemption. The promoter group structure is being reorganized but overall control dynamics remain similar.

**Shareholding Structure:** Current promoter group includes individuals (Suneeti Agarwal 0.79%, Sunil Agarwal 11.62%, Santanu Agarwal 3.71%) and corporate entities (PCPL 2.64%, PFPL 2.45%, EVCPL 19.94%) totaling 41.16% promoter holding.
