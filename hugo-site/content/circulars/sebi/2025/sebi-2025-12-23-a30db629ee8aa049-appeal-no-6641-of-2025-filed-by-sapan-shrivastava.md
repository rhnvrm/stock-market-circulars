## Summary

The SEBI Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6641 of 2025 filed by Sapan Shrivastava as time-barred. The appellant sought information under RTI Act regarding Elin Electronics Limited's IPO (listed December 30, 2022), including SEBI permission documents, lender NOCs, and observation letters. The appeal was filed on November 26, 2025, beyond the 30-day statutory period from the CPIO's response dated August 29, 2025, with no request for condoning the delay.

## Key Points

- Appeal filed by Sapan Shrivastava on November 26, 2025 regarding RTI application dated August 02, 2025
- Original RTI application sought three categories of information about Elin Electronics Limited IPO
- CPIO responded on August 29, 2025 to the RTI application
- Appeal dismissed as time-barred under Section 19(1) of RTI Act (filed beyond 30-day limit)
- No request for condoning delay or explanation for delayed filing submitted by appellant
- Authority considered appeal on merits notwithstanding procedural dismissal
- Query 1 deemed vague and generic by CPIO; appellant directed to Disclaimer clause in offer document
- Query 2 information not available with SEBI; lender details disclosed in offer document
- Query 3 information held in fiduciary capacity, exempt under Section 8(1)(e) of RTI Act

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an administrative order disposing of an RTI appeal.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. The order serves as a reminder that:
- RTI appeals must be filed within 30 days from receipt of CPIO response under Section 19(1) of RTI Act
- Requests for condoning delay must be explicitly made with valid reasons
- RTI queries must be specific and not vague or generic to qualify as "information" under Section 2(f) of RTI Act

## Important Dates

- August 02, 2025: RTI application filed by appellant
- August 29, 2025: CPIO response date
- September 28, 2025 (approximately): Last permissible date for filing appeal (30 days from CPIO response)
- November 26, 2025: Appeal actually filed (time-barred)
- December 23, 2025: Appeal dismissal order issued

## Impact Assessment

Minimal to no market impact. This is a procedural dismissal of an RTI appeal concerning historical IPO documentation from 2022. The order does not affect Elin Electronics Limited's listing status, market operations, or impose any penalties. It reinforces procedural requirements for RTI appeals but has no bearing on securities markets, trading operations, or compliance obligations for market participants.
