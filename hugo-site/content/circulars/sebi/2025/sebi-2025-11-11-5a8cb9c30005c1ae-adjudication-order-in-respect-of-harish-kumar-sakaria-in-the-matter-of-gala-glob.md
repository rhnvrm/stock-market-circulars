## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The order reinforces SEBI's continued surveillance and enforcement against price manipulation activities. The significant price movement in GGPL scrip (146.58% increase) during the investigation period highlights the manipulative activities that were under investigation.

**Regulatory Impact:** This case demonstrates SEBI's commitment to pursuing enforcement actions even after remand from appellate authorities, ensuring proper adjudication process is followed. The fresh adjudication following SAT's directions shows the regulator's adherence to due process.

**Investor Impact:** The enforcement action provides investor protection by penalizing manipulative activities that distort fair price discovery. The substantial penalty serves as a deterrent against similar violations.

**Procedural Impact:** The case highlights the importance of proper adjudication procedures, as the original order was set aside by SAT and remanded for fresh consideration, emphasizing the need for thorough hearing and consideration of defenses.
