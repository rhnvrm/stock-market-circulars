## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - Enforcement action against an individual associated with a company (Prakash Constrowell Limited, now Setubandhan Infrastructure Limited) signals serious regulatory compliance issues. This may affect investor confidence in the company and related parties.

**Operational Impact:** High - Bank account attachment severely restricts the financial operations of the noticee and indicates significant outstanding dues to SEBI. This is a serious enforcement measure typically used when other recovery methods have been exhausted.

**Legal Impact:** The attachment of bank accounts is a coercive recovery measure that can lead to further legal proceedings if the dues are not settled.
