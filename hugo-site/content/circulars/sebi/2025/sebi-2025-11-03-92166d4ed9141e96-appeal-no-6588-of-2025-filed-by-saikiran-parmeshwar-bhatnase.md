## Summary

Appeal No. 6588 of 2025 was filed by Saikiran Parmeshwar Bhatnase challenging the CPIO's response to his RTI application dated September 10, 2025. The appellant sought information on rules relied upon for chronic complainant definition in SCORES 2.0 FAQs and the procedure for correcting errors in SEBI documents. The Appellate Authority found that Query 1 was seeking clarification rather than information as defined under Section 2(f) of the RTI Act, and Query 2 was vague and not specific enough to constitute an information request.

## Key Points

- RTI application filed on September 10, 2025; CPIO responded on October 08, 2025
- Appeal filed on October 09, 2025 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00271)
- Query 1 sought rules/circulars relied upon for chronic complainant definition in SCORES 2.0 FAQs
- Query 2 sought complete procedure for correction of grammatical/linguistic errors in SEBI documents
- CPIO denied Query 1 under Section 8(1)(a) citing internal functioning and strategic nature
- CPIO rejected Query 2 as vague and not constituting "information" under Section 2(f)
- Appellate Authority found insufficient justification for Section 8(1)(a) exemption
- However, both queries deemed as seeking clarification/opinion rather than factual information
- Reliance placed on CIC decision in Azad Singh vs. CPIO, Oriental Insurance Company Limited (March 23, 2021)
