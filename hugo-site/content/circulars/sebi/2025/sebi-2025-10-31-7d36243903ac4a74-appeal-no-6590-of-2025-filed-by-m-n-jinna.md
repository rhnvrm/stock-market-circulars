## Summary

The Appellate Authority under the RTI Act dismissed Appeal No. 6590 of 2025 filed by M N Jinna on October 31, 2025. The appellant had sought information regarding rejection of PACL refund application worth Rs. 22,500, claiming no land allotment was received despite PACL records showing otherwise. SEBI's CPIO responded that the requested information is not available with SEBI. The Appellate Authority upheld this response and directed the appellant to the Justice (Retd.) R.M. Lodha Committee, which is responsible for PACL property disposal and investor repayment matters.

## Impact Assessment

This order has no market impact. It is an individual RTI appeal case related to PACL investor refund matters. The decision clarifies that SEBI does not hold information regarding land allotment status under PACL certificates, and such matters fall under the jurisdiction of the Justice R.M. Lodha Committee, constituted pursuant to the Supreme Court order dated February 2, 2016. The order reiterates that CPIOs can only provide information available in their records and cannot create information for appellants' benefit, citing precedent from the Central Information Commission.
