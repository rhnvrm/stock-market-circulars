## Impact Assessment

**Investor Protection Alert**: This case highlights the risk of fraudulent communications falsely claiming to be from SEBI. The forged letter attempted to extract money from the investor under the guise of regulatory compliance and money laundering verification. Investors should always verify communications through official SEBI channels and confirm intermediary registration status on the SEBI website. The case has no direct market impact but serves as an important investor awareness matter regarding financial fraud schemes.
