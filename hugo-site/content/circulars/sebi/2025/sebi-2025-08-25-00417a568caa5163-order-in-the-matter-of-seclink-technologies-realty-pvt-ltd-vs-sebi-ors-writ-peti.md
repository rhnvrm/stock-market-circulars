## Summary

The Bombay High Court disposed of Writ Petition (L) No. 25682 of 2025 filed by Seclink Technologies & Realty Pvt Ltd against SEBI and others on August 25, 2025. The court noted that the petitioner had filed a complaint with SEBI on August 14, 2025, raising substantially similar grievances as in the petition. Since the IPO process was concluded with shares allotted and refunds processed, the court directed SEBI to consider and dispose of the complaint within two months without examining the merits of the case.

## Key Points

- Petitioner filed simultaneous complaint with SEBI on August 14, 2025, with similar grievances as the writ petition
- IPO process was already concluded with shares allotted and refunds being processed
- Court disposed of petition without examining allegations or counter-allegations
- All contentions of all parties explicitly left open, including maintainability issues
- No costs order imposed

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes specified in this order.

## Compliance Requirements

SEBI is required to consider and dispose of Seclink Technologies & Realty Pvt Ltd's complaint dated August 14, 2025, in accordance with law within two months from August 25, 2025.

## Important Dates

- August 14, 2025: Date of complaint filed with SEBI
- August 25, 2025: Date of court order
- October 25, 2025: Deadline for SEBI to dispose of complaint (two months from order date)

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as the court disposed of the petition without examining merits and the related IPO process was already concluded. The order primarily establishes a procedural timeline for SEBI to address the complaint while keeping all substantive issues open for consideration.
