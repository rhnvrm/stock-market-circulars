The appellant had sought information regarding freezing of PAN belonging to a third party (Mahesh S Malu). The CPIO denied the request citing Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act which exempts personal information having no public interest and causing unwarranted invasion of privacy.

## Impact Assessment

This order has no market or operational impact. It is an administrative decision on an RTI appeal affirming that personal information about third party PAN freezing cannot be disclosed under Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act. The order reinforces privacy protection standards for personal information held by SEBI, citing Supreme Court precedent that personal records including names, addresses, and professional records constitute exempt personal information unless there is overriding public interest.
