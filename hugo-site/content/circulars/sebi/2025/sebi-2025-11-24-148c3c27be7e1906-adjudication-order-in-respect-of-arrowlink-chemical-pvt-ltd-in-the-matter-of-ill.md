## Impact Assessment

This adjudication order is part of SEBI's enforcement actions against systematic manipulation in illiquid stock options segment at BSE during 2014-2015. While the specific entity involved had limited trading activity (6 trades), the broader investigation revealed widespread market manipulation with over 81% of stock options trades being non-genuine during the investigation period. The order demonstrates SEBI's continued focus on cleaning up historical cases of market manipulation and serves as a deterrent against creating artificial volumes through reversal trades. The impact on current markets is minimal as this addresses historical violations, but reinforces compliance standards for derivatives trading and market integrity.
