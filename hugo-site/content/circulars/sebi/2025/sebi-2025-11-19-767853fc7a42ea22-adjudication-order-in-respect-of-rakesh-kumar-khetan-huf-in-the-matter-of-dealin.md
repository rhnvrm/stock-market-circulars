SEBI has issued Adjudication Order No. Order/JS/YK/2025-26/31787 against Rakesh Kumar Khetan HUF (PAN: AALHR4375J) for violations related to dealing in illiquid stock options on BSE. The investigation covered the period from April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015, during which the entity engaged in non-genuine reversal trades that created false or misleading appearance of trading and artificial volumes in stock options contracts. The proceedings were initiated for alleged violations of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations, 2003.

- Rakesh Kumar Khetan HUF was identified as one of the entities indulging in reversal trades

The case involves one entity among 14,720 entities identified during the investigation. The order reinforces SEBI's commitment to maintaining market integrity and deterring manipulative trading practices, but does not introduce new compliance obligations or affect current market operations.
