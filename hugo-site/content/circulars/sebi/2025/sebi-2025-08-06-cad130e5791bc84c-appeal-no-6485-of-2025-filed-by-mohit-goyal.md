  Platforms
---

## Summary

Appeal No. 6485 of 2025 filed by Mohit Goyal regarding an RTI application seeking information about algorithmic trading platforms and their regulatory compliance. The appeal was dismissed as the queries were deemed to be seeking clarification/opinion rather than information under the RTI Act.

## Key Points

- Appellant questioned regulatory framework for algorithmic trading platforms showing backtested strategies
- Concerned about unqualified persons offering trading strategies to retail investors
- Sought information on SEBI's knowledge and action against such platforms
- Appeal dismissed as queries sought clarification/opinion rather than factual information

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. Appeal references existing Master Circular on Stock Brokers dated June 17, 2025 for algorithmic trading guidelines.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. Existing algorithmic trading guidelines remain applicable as per Master Circular on Stock Brokers.

## Important Dates

- Appeal Filed: July 14, 2025 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00179)

## Impact Assessment
