The FPI failed to timely intimate its Designated Depository Participant (Standard Chartered Bank) about material changes including addition/deletion of share classes and updated beneficial owner information. The examination covered the period from December 13, 2023 to March 05, 2024, following a reference from the DDP on March 13, 2024 regarding delays in reporting through the SI Portal.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal - This is an entity-specific enforcement action with no broader market implications.

**Operational Impact:** Reinforces existing compliance obligations for FPIs regarding timely disclosure of material changes. Serves as reminder to all FPIs to maintain updated records with DDPs and ensure prompt reporting of Type I changes including share class modifications and beneficial owner updates.

**Investor Impact:** No direct impact on investors. Highlights importance of transparency in FPI structures and beneficial ownership disclosure framework.

**Precedent Value:** Demonstrates SEBI's continued monitoring of FPI compliance through DDP monthly reporting mechanism and willingness to initiate adjudication for procedural violations even when delays are detected through routine surveillance.
