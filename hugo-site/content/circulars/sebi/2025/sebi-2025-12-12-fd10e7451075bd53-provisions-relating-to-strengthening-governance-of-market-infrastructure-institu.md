## Impact Assessment

**Market Infrastructure Impact:**
Fundamental governance restructuring affecting all recognized Stock Exchanges, Clearing Corporations and Depositories in India. The bifurcation of executive leadership into two distinct verticals creates checks and balances in critical operations and regulatory compliance functions.

**Operational Impact:**
MIIs must establish dual executive leadership structure with independent oversight mechanisms. The requirement for separate SCOT meetings with Vertical 1 ED without MD presence introduces additional operational independence in technology governance. Recruitment and approval timelines require advance succession planning.

**Compliance Burden:**
Substantial compliance requirements including mandatory recruitment processes, SEBI approval mechanisms, performance evaluation frameworks, and compensation approval processes. Smaller or newer MIIs may face challenges requiring exemption applications.

**Governance Enhancement:**
Significant strengthening of MII governance through mandatory Board-level representation of both EDs, independent performance assessment by PIDs, and structured oversight by SCOT. Enhanced accountability framework for critical operations and regulatory functions.

**Systemic Significance:**
Recognizes growing importance of MIIs given phenomenal market growth in capitalization, trading volumes, technology adoption and investor base. Strengthened governance aims to prevent lapses that could adversely impact securities markets and broader economy.

**Industry Response:**
MIIs have limited time (8 days from circular date) to prepare for December 20, 2025 implementation. Case-by-case exemption provision provides flexibility for institutions facing genuine difficulties while maintaining overall governance standards.
