---

## Summary

SEBI has issued a public caution regarding unregistered Online Bond Platform Providers (OBPPs), including fintech companies and stock brokers offering such services without proper registration from Stock Exchanges. These unregistered platforms operate without regulatory oversight, lack investor protection mechanisms, and may violate the Companies Act 2013, SEBI Act 1992, and related regulations. SEBI has previously issued an interim order on November 18, 2024 against certain such entities.

## Key Points

- Certain entities including fintech companies and stock brokers are operating as OBPPs without mandatory registration from Stock Exchanges

- Unregistered platforms lack regulatory oversight and investor protection mechanisms
- Activities may violate Companies Act 2013 and SEBI Act 1992
- SEBI issued interim order on November 18, 2024 against some unregistered entities
- Investors urged to verify registration status before transacting
