## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Limited direct market impact as this concerns a single Investment Adviser firm. However, serves as a precedent for enforcement actions against IAs violating regulatory norms.

**Industry Impact:** Significant for Investment Advisers as it highlights SEBI's focus on comprehensive compliance including qualifications, fee structures, client agreements, record maintenance, risk profiling, and prohibition of fraudulent practices including fake reviews and improper marketing.

**Investor Protection:** Protects investors from unqualified advisers, improper fee structures, inadequate risk assessment, and fraudulent marketing practices.

**Compliance Focus Areas:** The order emphasizes multiple compliance areas including professional qualifications, transparent fee structures, proper documentation, risk profiling processes, and ethical marketing practices. The identification of fake reviews and use of personal communication channels for business indicates SEBI's enhanced scrutiny of IA marketing and communication practices.
