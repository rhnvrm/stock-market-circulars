## Key Points

No new regulatory changes. This is an enforcement action under existing SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations, 2003.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must not execute reversal trades that create artificial volumes
- Trading in illiquid stock options must be genuine and not manipulative

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal direct market impact as this is a historical enforcement action against an individual trader for violations that occurred over a decade ago. The trades involved were limited in scope (2 trades, 2000 units).

**Regulatory Impact:** Demonstrates SEBI's continued enforcement against market manipulation practices in illiquid stock options, even for historical violations. Part of broader crackdown on artificial volume creation on BSE's stock options segment.

**Precedent Value:** Reinforces that creation of artificial volumes through reversal trades in illiquid securities constitutes manipulation and will attract penalties, regardless of trade size.
