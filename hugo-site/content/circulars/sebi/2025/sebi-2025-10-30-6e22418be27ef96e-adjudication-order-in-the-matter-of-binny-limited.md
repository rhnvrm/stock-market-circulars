## Summary

## Key Points

- Violations identified through complaints received by SEBI and subsequent examination
- Multiple breaches of LODR Regulations including disclosure and corporate governance requirements
- Board composition during violation period included 9 directors (3 executive, 4 independent, 2 non-executive non-independent)
- Directors alleged to have violated specific provisions related to their fiduciary duties

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This order enforces existing LODR Regulations and corporate governance standards.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Binny Limited:**
- Must comply with Regulations 27(2), 31(1)(b), 33(d) - corporate governance and financial reporting requirements
- Must adhere to Regulation 30 disclosure requirements including timely material event disclosures as per Schedule III
- Must follow SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2023/123 dated July 13, 2023

- **Various appointment dates**: Directors appointed between March 1996 and May 2024 (as listed in Table 1)

## Impact Assessment

**Company-Specific Impact:**
Binny Limited faces regulatory penalties and reputational damage from multiple LODR violations. The company must strengthen compliance mechanisms for disclosure requirements and corporate governance standards.

**Market Impact:**
Limited direct market impact as this affects a single listed entity. However, the order serves as a compliance reminder for other listed companies regarding:
- Timely disclosure of material events
- Adherence to corporate governance reporting requirements
- Director fiduciary responsibilities
- Importance of following SEBI circulars and LODR provisions

**Regulatory Precedent:**
Reinforces SEBI's active enforcement of LODR Regulations and willingness to take action against both companies and individual directors for governance and disclosure failures. Directors of listed companies should note their personal liability for compliance failures.
