## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to medium - This case involves an individual advisor's misrepresentation in documentation rather than systemic market manipulation or widespread fraud.

**Compliance Impact:** Medium - Reinforces the importance of accurate disclosure of roles and designations in open offer documentation and escrow agreements. Merchant Bankers and their advisors must ensure complete transparency in their representations.

**Regulatory Precedent:** Establishes that misrepresentation of one's official designation in regulatory documents, even if the person had authorization to act, constitutes a violation of PFUTP Regulations and attracts penalties under Section 15HA of SEBI Act.

**Industry Impact:** Serves as a reminder to all merchant banking professionals and advisors that accuracy in disclosure of official capacity is critical, and misrepresentation - even regarding titles - will be treated as fraudulent conduct.
