## Summary

SEBI has issued the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Foreign Portfolio Investors) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2025, effective December 1, 2025. The amendments introduce a single window access mechanism for trusted foreign investors and modify provisions allowing SEBI-registered mutual funds to be part of FPI applicants. Key changes include revised investment limits for AIFs and retail schemes within FPI structures, and enhanced flexibility for fund management entities.

## Key Points

- Introduction of "Single Window Access (Swagat-FI)" for trusted foreign investors including government and government-related investors, and public retail funds
- SEBI-registered mutual funds can now be part of FPI applicant structures subject to conditions
- Investment limits for AIFs as part of FPI applicant increased to 10% of applicant's corpus (from previous 2.5%/USD 750,000)
- Investment limits for retail schemes set at 10% of AUM (Assets Under Management)
- Regulations effective 180 days from gazette publication date, except certain provisions which are effective immediately
- Amendments to definition of fund management entity and associated entities

## Regulatory Changes

**New Definition - Single Window Access (Swagat-FI):**
- Covers government and government-related investors as per Regulation 5(a)(i)
- Includes public retail funds as defined in Regulation 22(4)
- Subject to conditions prescribed by SEBI from time to time

**Mutual Funds as FPI Applicants:**
- Mutual funds registered under SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996 can be part of FPI applicant
- Subject to compliance with conditions specified by SEBI

**Revised Investment Limits:**
- AIFs (Alternative Investment Funds): Can invest up to 10% of applicant's corpus (previously 2.5% or USD 750,000, whichever lower)
- Retail Schemes: Can invest up to 10% of AUM
- Changes in terminology from "sponsor or manager" to "fund management entity or its associate"

**Technical Amendments:**
- Renumbering of existing clause (d) to clause (dh) in Regulation 2(1)
- Addition of new clause (d) for Single Window Access definition
- Modifications to Regulation 4(c)(v) regarding applicant composition

## Compliance Requirements

**For Foreign Portfolio Investors:**
- Government and government-related investors and public retail funds should prepare for single window access mechanism
- FPIs with mutual fund or AIF components must ensure compliance with revised investment limits
- Fund management entities need to review and adjust investment structures to comply with new 10% thresholds

**For Designated Depository Participants (DDPs):**
- Update systems and processes to accommodate single window access for eligible investors
- Revise FPI registration procedures to reflect amendments regarding mutual fund participation
- Implement revised investment limit checks for AIFs and retail schemes

**For SEBI-Registered Mutual Funds:**
- Evaluate eligibility and commercial viability of participating as part of FPI applicant structures
- Ensure compliance with SEBI-prescribed conditions for such participation

## Important Dates

- **Immediate Effect**: Provisions under Regulation 3, Sub-regulation II, clauses (i) and (ii) regarding Single Window Access
- **180 Days from Publication**: Remaining provisions become effective (approximately **May 30, 2026**)

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts:**
- Streamlined access for trusted foreign investors through single window mechanism may attract more government and institutional investors

- Enhanced regulatory oversight may be required for new categories of FPI applicants
