## Summary

SEBI and the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority (IEPFA), Ministry of Corporate Affairs, jointly organized the third "Niveshak Shivir" at Amritsar, Punjab on November 01, 2025. This investor outreach initiative aims to assist shareholders in reclaiming unpaid dividends and unclaimed shares, thereby reducing the volume of unclaimed investor assets in the system. The event was organized in collaboration with Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs) - BSE, NSE, CDSL & NSDL and Registrar and Transfer Agents (RTAs) - KFin Technologies Ltd., MUFG Intime India Pvt. Ltd., & Bigshare Services Pvt. Ltd.

## Key Points

- Over 223 investors and claimants from Amritsar and surrounding areas participated in the day-long event
- 17 dedicated service desks were set up under one roof offering end-to-end assistance
- Services included claiming dividends and shares unclaimed for over six years, on-the-spot KYC and nomination updates, prompt resolution of claim-related issues, and processing of pending IEPFA claims
- Direct facilitation of unpaid dividends and claims pending for over six to seven years was provided
- Dedicated kiosks were set up by stakeholder companies and RTAs, allowing investors to interact directly with officials without intermediaries
- Event was attended by senior officials including Smt. Anita Shah Akella (CEO of IEPFA and Joint Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs) and Shri Binod Sharma (General Manager, SEBI)
- An explainer video "Understanding the Process of Claiming Unpaid Dividends through IEPFA" was launched, conceptualized by CDSL IPF
- This is the third edition in the Niveshak Shivir series
- Similar events are proposed to be conducted in other cities with significant unclaimed investor assets
