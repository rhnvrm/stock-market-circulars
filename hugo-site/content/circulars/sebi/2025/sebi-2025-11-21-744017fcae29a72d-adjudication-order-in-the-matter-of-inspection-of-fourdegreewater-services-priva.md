**Operational Impact**: The entity Fourdegreewater Services Private Limited and its directors face adjudication proceedings which may result in penalties. This order reinforces accountability of both the corporate entity and individual directors/KMPs.

**Industry Impact**: This adjudication order sends a strong compliance message to all stock brokers operating as Online Bond Platform Providers regarding strict adherence to:
