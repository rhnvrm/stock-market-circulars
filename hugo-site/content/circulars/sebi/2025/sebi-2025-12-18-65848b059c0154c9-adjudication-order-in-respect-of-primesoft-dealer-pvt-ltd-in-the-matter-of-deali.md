## Summary

SEBI has issued an adjudication order against Primesoft Dealer Pvt. Ltd. (PAN: AAFCP4566Q), which has since been renamed to Aleit Advisory Pvt.

During the investigation period from April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015, the entity executed non-genuine reversal trades that created artificial volumes and false appearance of trading activity. This case is part of a larger investigation where 2,91,744 trades (81.41% of all trades in BSE's stock options segment) were identified as reversal trades involving 14,720 entities.

## Important Dates

- **Investigation Period**: April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015

- **Order Number**: Order/JS/VC/2025-26/31846

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The order addresses historical market manipulation in the illiquid stock options segment of BSE. The identification of 81.41% of trades as non-genuine reversal trades indicates significant manipulation during the investigation period. This enforcement action demonstrates SEBI's commitment to maintaining market integrity even in less liquid segments.

**Operational Impact**: This case is part of a broader crackdown involving 14,720 entities, signaling heightened scrutiny of trading patterns in illiquid derivatives. Market participants engaged in stock options trading should review their trading practices to ensure compliance with PFUTP regulations and avoid patterns that could be construed as creating artificial volumes.

**Precedent Value**: The case establishes that reversal trades lacking basic trading rationale will be considered manipulative and deceptive, even in illiquid segments where such practices might have been more common. The long timeline from investigation (2014-2015) to adjudication (2025) indicates SEBI's persistent pursuit of market manipulation cases.
