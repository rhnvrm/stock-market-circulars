## Impact Assessment

This adjudication order is part of SEBI's systematic enforcement action against a widespread manipulation scheme in BSE's illiquid stock options segment. With 14,720 entities involved and over 81% of trades being non-genuine, this represents a significant market integrity issue from 2014-2015. The enforcement action, though delayed, demonstrates SEBI's commitment to pursuing manipulative practices even in less liquid market segments. Individual traders and brokers should note that reversal trades lacking economic rationale will attract regulatory action and penalties under PFUTP regulations. The case establishes precedent for identifying and penalizing pattern-based manipulation through artificial volume creation.
