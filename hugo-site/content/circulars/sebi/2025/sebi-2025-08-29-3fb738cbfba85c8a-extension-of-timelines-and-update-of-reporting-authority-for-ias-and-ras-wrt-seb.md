title: Extension of Digital Accessibility Compliance Timelines for Investment Advisors
  and Research Analysts
---

## Summary

SEBI has extended compliance timelines for digital accessibility requirements under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, following representations from regulated entities. The circular also updates the reporting authority for Investment Advisors (IAs) and Research Analysts (RAs) from SEBI/BASL to BSE Ltd.

## Key Points

- Extension granted for digital accessibility compliance requirements across six different compliance areas
- Reporting authority for IAs and RAs changed from SEBI and BASL respectively to BSE Ltd.
- Extensions range from 1 month to next financial year depending on the compliance requirement
- All regulated entities must ensure accessibility of their digital platforms for persons with disabilities

## Regulatory Changes

- **Reporting Authority Update**: Investment Advisors and Research Analysts must now report compliance to BSE Ltd. instead of SEBI and BASL respectively
- **Extended Timeline Structure**: Phased approach with different extensions for various compliance requirements
- **Annual Compliance Cycle**: Annual accessibility audits now aligned with financial year reporting

## Compliance Requirements

1. **Compliance Report Submission**: Submit action taken report by September 30, 2025 (extended from August 30, 2025)
2. **Digital Platform List**: Submit list of digital platforms by September 30, 2025 (extended from August 30, 2025)
3. **IAAP Certified Auditor Appointment**: Appoint accessibility professionals by December 14, 2025 (extended from September 14, 2025)
4. **Accessibility Audit Conduct**: Complete audits by April 30, 2026 (extended from October 31, 2025)
5. **Remediation Implementation**: Complete remediation by July 31, 2026 (extended from January 31, 2025)
6. **Annual Compliance**: Submit annual audit reports by April 30, 2027 (extended to next financial year)

## Important Dates

- **September 30, 2025**: Compliance report and digital platform list submission
- **December 14, 2025**: IAAP certified accessibility professional appointment
- **April 30, 2026**: Accessibility audit completion
- **July 31, 2026**: Remediation completion
- **April 30, 2027**: First annual compliance report due

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Regulated entities get additional time to implement digital accessibility measures, reducing immediate compliance pressure. The change in reporting authority to BSE Ltd. for IAs and RAs streamlines the reporting process but requires entities to update their compliance procedures and contacts.
