title: Review, Appeal or Waiver of penalty requests emanating out of actions taken
  by the Member Committee
---

## Summary

SEBI has modified the mechanism for handling review, appeal or waiver of penalty requests emanating from Member Committee (MC) actions at Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs). The circular establishes a new two-tier appeal system where appeals against Internal Committee actions go to the MC, while appeals against MC actions will be handled by a separate mechanism involving Public Interest Directors and/or Independent External Professionals.

## Key Points

- New streamlined mechanism for handling penalty review, appeal or waiver requests
- Two-tier system: IC appeals go to MC, MC appeals go to separate mechanism
- Governing Board must establish mechanism with Public Interest Directors/Independent External Professionals
- Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) required for handling MC appeal requests
- Further appeals can be made to appropriate authority under applicable laws
- Applicable to all Stock Exchanges, Clearing Corporations, and Depositories

## Regulatory Changes

- Modified Terms of Reference (ToR) for Member Committees of MIIs
- Appeals against Internal Committee actions: handled by Member Committee
- Appeals against Member Committee actions: handled by new mechanism established by Governing Board
- Governing Board must create SOP for handling review/appeal requests from MC actions
- Separation of appeal authority from original decision-making body for MC actions

## Compliance Requirements

- MIIs must implement necessary systems for the new appeal mechanism
- Governing Boards must establish appeal mechanism with Public Interest Directors/Independent External Professionals
- Amendment of relevant byelaws, rules and regulations where required
- Creation of Standard Operating Procedures for handling MC appeals
- Notification to market participants and website dissemination
- Implementation within 45 days of circular issuance

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: August 05, 2025
- **Effective Date**: 45 days from issuance (approximately September 19, 2025)
- **Implementation Deadline**: All systems and procedures must be in place by effective date

## Impact Assessment

- **Operational Impact**: MIIs need to establish new appeal mechanisms and update procedures
- **Governance Impact**: Enhanced separation of powers in penalty appeal process
- **Member Impact**: Clearer appeal pathways for market participants facing regulatory actions
- **Compliance Burden**: Moderate - requires procedural changes and bylaw amendments
- **Market Functionality**: Minimal direct impact on trading operations, focused on regulatory processes
