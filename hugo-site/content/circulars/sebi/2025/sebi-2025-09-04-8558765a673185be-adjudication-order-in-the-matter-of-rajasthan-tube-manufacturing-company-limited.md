- 11 entities charged including company officials, promoters, and independent directors
- Violations include fraudulent sales inflation and misrepresentation in books of accounts
- Case initiated based on Central GST department findings on input tax credit fraud

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is an enforcement action under existing SEBI regulations including PFUTP Regulations and LODR Regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies must ensure accurate financial reporting without artificial transactions
