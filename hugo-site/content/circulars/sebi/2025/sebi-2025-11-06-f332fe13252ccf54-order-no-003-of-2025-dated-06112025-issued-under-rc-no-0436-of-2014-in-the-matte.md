## Impact Assessment

This order has limited market-wide impact as it pertains to specific recovery proceedings against a single entity for violations dating back to 2002. The enforcement action demonstrates SEBI's continued pursuit of recovery from defaulters under Collective Investment Schemes regulations. The case involves attachment of significant assets including real estate and agricultural land valued in crores. For investors in Four Season Farms schemes, this represents ongoing efforts to recover their funds, though recovery timeline remains uncertain given the multi-year nature of proceedings.
