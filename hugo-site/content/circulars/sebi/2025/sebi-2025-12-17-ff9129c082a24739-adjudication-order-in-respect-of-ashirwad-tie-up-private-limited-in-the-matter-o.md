## Impact Assessment

This adjudication order demonstrates SEBI's continued focus on cleaning up historical market manipulation cases, particularly in illiquid stock options segment. The case reveals systemic issues at BSE during 2014-2015 where over 81% of stock options trades were non-genuine. While this specific order concerns one entity's 11 trades, it is part of a broader enforcement initiative targeting multiple entities involved in creating artificial volumes. The action serves as a deterrent against similar manipulative practices and reinforces regulatory oversight of derivatives trading. Impact on current market operations is limited as it addresses historical violations, but establishes important enforcement precedent for detecting and penalizing reversal trades and artificial volume creation.
