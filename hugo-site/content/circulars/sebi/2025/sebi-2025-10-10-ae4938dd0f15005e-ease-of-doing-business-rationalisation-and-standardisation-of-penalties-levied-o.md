title: Ease of doing business – Rationalisation and standardisation of penalties levied
  on stock brokers by stock exchanges
---

## Summary

SEBI has announced a comprehensive revision of the penalty framework for stock brokers through stock exchanges, effective October 10, 2025. The reform addresses inconsistencies in penalties across exchanges, eliminates multiple penalties for the same violation, and introduces the term 'financial disincentive' for procedural lapses to reduce reputational impact. Out of 235 penalty items reviewed, 40 have been removed entirely, 105 have been reclassified as financial disincentives, and 90 remain as penalties with various rationalizations. The framework will apply to ongoing enforcement proceedings and is complemented by Phase 2 expansion of Samuhik Prativedan Manch common reporting mechanism.

## Key Points

- SEBI Working Group comprising exchange and broker association representatives developed revised penalty framework
- 235 existing penalty items reviewed in first phase
- 40 violations no longer attract penalties
- 105 minor procedural lapses reclassified from 'penalty' to 'financial disincentive'
- Only 90 violations retain penalty classification, with rationalizations applied
- Lead exchange mechanism introduced to avoid multiple penalties for violations common across exchanges
- Revised framework applicable to ongoing enforcement proceedings, providing retrospective relief
- Samuhik Prativedan Manch Phase 2 adds 30 additional compliance reports from October 15, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

### Penalty Framework Rationalization

**Terminology Change:**
- Procedural lapses/technical errors now termed 'financial disincentive' instead of 'penalty' to avoid reputational stigma
- 'Penalty' term reserved for 90 actual violations only

**Penalty Rationalization Breakdown (90 violations):**
- 36 violations: Advisory/warning for first instance instead of monetary penalty
- 29 violations: Introduction of penalty capping (maximum amount limits)
- 12 violations: New penalties introduced
- 7 violations: Penalty amount reduced
- 6 violations: No change

**Lead Exchange Mechanism:**
- For violations common across multiple exchanges, only lead exchange will levy penalty
- Eliminates duplicate penalties for brokers with multiple exchange memberships

**Consistency Across Exchanges:**
- Standardized nature and quantum of penalties across all stock exchanges for same observations

### Samuhik Prativedan Manch (SPM) Expansion

**Phase 1 (August 1, 2025):**
- 40 compliance reports operationalized through common reporting mechanism

**Phase 2 (October 15, 2025):**
- Additional 30 compliance reports to be operationalized
- Total 70 reports available through single exchange submission

## Compliance Requirements

**For Stock Brokers:**
- Familiarize with revised penalty classification (penalties vs. financial disincentives)
- Understand which violations now attract advisory/warning for first instance
- Utilize Samuhik Prativedan Manch for filing common reports at single exchange
- Review ongoing enforcement matters for potential relief under new framework

**For Stock Exchanges:**
- Implement revised penalty framework issued in consultation with SEBI
- Apply lead exchange mechanism for common violations
- Ensure consistent penalty application across exchanges
- Apply revised framework to ongoing enforcement proceedings

## Important Dates

- **October 10, 2025**: Revised penalty framework issued and effective
- **August 1, 2025**: SPM Phase 1 implemented (40 compliance reports)
- **October 15, 2025**: SPM Phase 2 implementation (additional 30 compliance reports)

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact on Stock Brokers:**

1. **Significant Penalty Reduction**: 40 violations completely removed and 105 reclassified as financial disincentives reduces compliance burden and costs

2. **Reputational Protection**: Terminology change from 'penalty' to 'financial disincentive' for procedural lapses reduces stigma and reputational risk

3. **Elimination of Multiple Penalties**: Lead exchange mechanism prevents same violation being penalized by multiple exchanges, reducing financial burden for brokers with multiple memberships

4. **First-Instance Relief**: 36 violations now attract advisory/warning instead of immediate penalty, providing opportunity for correction

5. **Retrospective Application**: Application to ongoing enforcement proceedings provides immediate relief to brokers facing existing penalty actions

6. **Compliance Cost Reduction**: SPM expansion to 70 total reports reduces reporting burden and operational costs

**Market Impact:**
- Enhanced ease of doing business improves regulatory environment for brokerage industry
- Standardization removes competitive disadvantages from inconsistent penalty application
- Reduced compliance costs may improve broker profitability
- More proportionate enforcement approach balances investor protection with business facilitation

**Regulatory Impact:**
- Demonstrates SEBI's commitment to consultative regulatory approach
- Balances enforcement objectives with industry concerns
- Sets precedent for evidence-based regulatory reform through Working Group model
