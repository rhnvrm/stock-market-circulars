## Summary

The Appellate Authority under the RTI Act disposed of Appeal No. 6642 of 2025 filed by Dipakbhai Jashvantlal Panchal against the denial of information by SEBI's CPIO. The appellant had sought certified copies of appointment/designation documents for Shri S. Ramann as Chief General Manager as of December 1, 2009. The CPIO denied the request citing Section 8(1)(a) exemption, claiming the information was strategic and related to policy-making. The Appellate Authority found insufficient justification for the denial and remitted the matter back to the CPIO for fresh consideration.

## Key Points

- Original RTI application dated October 30, 2025 sought appointment order documents for Shri S. Ramann as CGM on December 1, 2009
- CPIO denied information citing Section 8(1)(a) exemption (strategic and policy-making nature)
- Appeal filed on November 28, 2025 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00315)
- Appellate Authority found the exemption claim lacked sufficient justification
- Matter remitted to CPIO for de novo consideration
- CPIO must provide appropriate response within 15 working days from receipt of order

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an administrative order under the RTI Act framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- CPIO must reconsider the RTI application with proper justification if denying under Section 8(1)(a)
- Response must be provided to the appellant within 15 working days from receipt of the Appellate Authority's order dated December 23, 2025
- Any denial must include adequate explanation of how the exemption applies to the requested information

## Important Dates

- **October 30, 2025**: RTI application filed by appellant
- **November 27, 2025**: CPIO's response denying information
- **November 28, 2025**: Appeal filed by appellant

## Impact Assessment

This order has minimal market impact as it concerns an internal administrative matter related to RTI compliance. The case involves a request for historical appointment documentation from 2009 and demonstrates the Appellate Authority's oversight of information disclosure practices. The remittance indicates that CPIOs must provide adequate justification when invoking exemptions under the RTI Act. No direct impact on trading, listed entities, or market operations.
