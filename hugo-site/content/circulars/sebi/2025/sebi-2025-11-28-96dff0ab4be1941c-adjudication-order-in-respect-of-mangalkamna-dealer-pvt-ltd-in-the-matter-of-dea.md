## Impact Assessment

This is an individual enforcement action with minimal market-wide impact. The order relates to historical trading activities from 2014-2015 in illiquid stock options on BSE. While part of a broader investigation involving over 14,000 entities, this specific adjudication order affects only Mangalkamna Dealer Pvt. Ltd. The matter demonstrates SEBI's continued enforcement against market manipulation practices, particularly reversal trades that create artificial volumes, but does not introduce new regulatory requirements or affect current market operations.
