## Impact Assessment

This adjudication order is part of SEBI's systematic action against the widespread manipulation in illiquid stock options at BSE that occurred in 2014-2015. While the order impacts only one individual entity, it represents SEBI's continued enforcement efforts against the 14,720 entities identified in this investigation. The order reinforces market integrity by deterring manipulative practices, though its direct market impact is minimal as it addresses historical violations in a now-defunct or reformed market segment. The action demonstrates regulatory vigilance in pursuing individual violators even years after the offense, serving as a deterrent for similar manipulative activities.
