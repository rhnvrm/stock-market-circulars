title: Confirmatory Order Against Gensol Engineering Limited for Document Falsification
  and Corporate Governance Violations
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued a confirmatory order against Gensol Engineering Limited and its directors Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi following allegations of document falsification and corporate governance violations. The action stems from complaints received in June 2024 regarding alleged share price manipulation and fund diversion, leading to an interim order on April 15, 2025.

## Key Points

- Credit rating agencies CARE and ICRA downgraded Gensol's ratings to 'D' in March 2025
- ICRA disclosed that certain documents shared by Gensol regarding debt servicing track record were apparently falsified
- Gensol allegedly provided falsified Conduct Letters from lenders IREDA and PFC to rating agencies
- Company submitted fake No Objection Certificate (NOC) purportedly from lenders to support rating withdrawal request
- SEBI examination revealed concerns about corporate governance practices and liquidity position
- Case involves share price manipulation and fund diversion allegations

## Regulatory Changes

This confirmatory order reinforces SEBI's enforcement framework against document falsification and corporate governance violations by listed entities and their management.

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies must ensure all documents submitted to credit rating agencies are genuine and accurate
- Directors must maintain proper corporate governance standards
- Companies must provide truthful information about debt servicing capabilities
- Proper documentation and verification processes must be followed for all regulatory submissions

## Important Dates

- June 2024: Initial complaint received by SEBI
- March 3, 2025: CARE downgraded Gensol's rating to 'D'
- March 4, 2025: ICRA downgraded Gensol's rating to 'D'
- April 15, 2025: SEBI issued interim order
- July 30, 2025: Confirmatory order issued

## Impact Assessment

This case highlights serious corporate governance failures that can significantly impact investor confidence and market integrity. The involvement of falsified documents to credit rating agencies poses systemic risks to the credit assessment framework. The confirmatory order serves as a strong deterrent against such malpractices and reinforces the importance of truthful disclosure by listed entities.
