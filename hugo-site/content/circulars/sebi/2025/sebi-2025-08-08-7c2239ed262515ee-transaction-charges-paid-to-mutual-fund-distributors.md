## Summary

SEBI has eliminated transaction charges paid to mutual fund distributors by deleting paragraphs 10.4.1.b and 10.5 from the Master Circular for Mutual Funds. This change removes the previous requirement of minimum subscription amount of INR 10,000 for distributors to receive transaction charges.

## Key Points

- Transaction charges to mutual fund distributors are completely removed
- Previous minimum subscription requirement of INR 10,000 is eliminated
- Paragraphs 10.4.1.b and 10.5 of SEBI Master Circular for Mutual Funds are deleted
- Change based on public consultation in May 2023 and industry consultation in June 2025
- Distributors as agents of AMCs remain entitled to remuneration from AMCs

## Regulatory Changes

- Complete removal of transaction charges framework for mutual fund distributors
- Deletion of specific regulatory provisions (paragraphs 10.4.1.b and 10.5) from Master Circular
- Streamlining of distributor compensation structure

## Compliance Requirements

- All Mutual Funds must comply immediately
- All Asset Management Companies (AMCs) must adjust compensation structures
- All Trustee Companies must ensure compliance
- AMFI and RTAs must implement changes in their systems

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: Immediate effect from August 08, 2025
