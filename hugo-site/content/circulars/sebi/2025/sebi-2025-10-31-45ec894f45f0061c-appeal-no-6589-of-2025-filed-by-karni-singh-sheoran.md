## Impact Assessment

This order has no market impact. It is an individual administrative matter relating to an RTI appeal concerning PACL refund information. The order reiterates that SEBI does not possess details of land allotments made by PACL Ltd., and such matters fall under the jurisdiction of the Justice R.M. Lodha Committee established by the Supreme Court. The decision follows established precedent that CPIOs cannot provide information not in their possession (citing CIC decision in Pattipati Rama Murthy vs. CPIO, SEBI, July 8, 2013).
