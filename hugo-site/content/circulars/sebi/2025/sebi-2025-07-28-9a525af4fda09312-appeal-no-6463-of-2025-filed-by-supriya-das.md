  Loss Margin and Trading Support Measures
---

## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority dismissed RTI Appeal No. 6463 of 2025 filed by Supriya Das, who sought information about the justification for additional 2% Extreme Loss Margin (ELM) on expiry days and SEBI's trader support initiatives. The authority ruled that the queries sought clarification/opinion rather than factual information as defined under the RTI Act.

## Key Points

- Appeal filed on June 30, 2025 against CPIO SEBI Mumbai's response dated June 30, 2025
- Original RTI application dated June 3, 2025 sought three specific pieces of information
- Appellate Authority upheld CPIO's decision to refuse information citing queries as opinion-seeking
- Reference made to CIC precedent in Azad Singh vs. CPIO, Oriental Insurance Company Limited case

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is an administrative decision on RTI compliance.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. Confirms that RTI applications seeking opinions or clarifications rather than factual information can be legitimately refused by CPIOs.

## Important Dates

- June 3, 2025: Original RTI application filed
- June 30, 2025: CPIO response provided
- June 30, 2025: Appeal filed (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00160)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is an administrative RTI matter. The dismissal clarifies the scope of information available under RTI Act but does not affect trading operations, margin requirements, or regulatory policies. The original queries about ELM justification and trader support measures remain unanswered through RTI process.
