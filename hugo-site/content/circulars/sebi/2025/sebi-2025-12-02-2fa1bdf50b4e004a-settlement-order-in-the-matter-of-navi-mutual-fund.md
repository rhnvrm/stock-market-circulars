The impact of this settlement order is minimal on broader market operations. This is an entity-specific compliance matter involving a technical violation of expense ratio limits by Navi Mutual Fund. The applicants have already implemented remedial measures including TER adjustments across 8 schemes and expense control initiatives. The settlement amount of ₹10.20 lakhs is relatively modest, indicating the regulatory breach was not severe. The suo motu nature of the application demonstrates proactive compliance efforts.
