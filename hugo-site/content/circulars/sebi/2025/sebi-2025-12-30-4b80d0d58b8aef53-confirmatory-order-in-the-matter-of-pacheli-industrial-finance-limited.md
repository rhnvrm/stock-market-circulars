  Allottees for Market Manipulation
---

## Summary

SEBI issued a Confirmatory Order under sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B of the SEBI Act against Pacheli Industrial Finance Limited (PIFL) and six preferential allottees, restraining them from buying, selling or dealing in securities or accessing capital markets. The action follows an abnormal 372% price increase (from INR 21.02 to INR 78.2) between December 2, 2024 and January 16, 2025, despite the company reporting negligible revenues and a P/E ratio of 4,05,664, indicating severe disconnect between share price and fundamentals. The stock was under ASM Stage 4 surveillance and hitting 5% upper circuit daily since December 9, 2024.

## Key Points

- Stock was under Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) Stage 4 and hitting 5% upper circuit daily since December 9, 2024
- Company reported zero operating income in FY 2021-22 and FY 2022-23
- FY 2023-24 operating revenue of only INR 1.07 crore driven by bad debt recovery (INR 0.44 crore) and interest income (INR 0.63 crore)
- P/E ratio reached extraordinarily steep 4,05,664 as on January 16, 2024
- Interim Order dated January 16, 2025 restrained 7 entities from accessing capital markets

- **December 9, 2024**: Stock began hitting 5% upper circuit daily
- **January 16, 2025**: Interim Order issued; share price reached INR 78.2; market cap INR 4,057 crore

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Severe - The 372% abnormal price rise with daily upper circuits created artificial market activity in PIFL scrip. The extreme P/E ratio of 4,05,664 represents complete disconnection from company fundamentals, potentially misleading retail investors. Market capitalization inflated to INR 4,057 crore despite negligible business operations.

**Operational Impact**: Complete capital market freeze for all 7 noticees prevents any securities transactions or market access. This impacts PIFL's ability to raise capital and all preferential allottees' market activities.

**Investor Impact**: High risk to investors who purchased shares during the manipulation period. The stark contrast between share price performance and actual business fundamentals (zero revenue in two consecutive years, minimal revenue in third year) indicates potential investor losses.

**Regulatory Impact**: Case demonstrates SEBI's surveillance mechanisms detecting price-fundamental anomalies. ASM Stage 4 classification and subsequent enforcement action reflect regulatory focus on protecting market integrity. Detailed investigation directed to uncover complete manipulation mechanism.
