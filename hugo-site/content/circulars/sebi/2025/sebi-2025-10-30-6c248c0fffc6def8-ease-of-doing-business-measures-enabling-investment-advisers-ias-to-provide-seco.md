title: Investment Advisers Permitted to Charge Fees for Second Opinion on Assets Under
  Pre-existing Distribution Arrangements
---

## Summary

SEBI has introduced ease of doing business measures allowing registered Investment Advisers (IAs) to charge fees for providing second opinions on client assets that are under pre-existing distribution arrangements with other entities. Previously, IAs were prohibited from charging Assets Under Advice (AUA) based fees on such assets. The new provision permits IAs to charge up to 2.5% per annum of such assets' value, subject to mandatory annual disclosure and consent requirements.

## Key Points

- Investment Advisers can now charge fees for second opinions on assets under pre-existing distribution arrangements
- Fee capped at maximum 2.5% of asset value per annum
- IAs must obtain annual consent from clients disclosing dual cost structure (advisory fees plus distributor consideration)
- Revision to Clause 1.(iii)(f) of the Master Circular for Investment Advisers
- Change addresses industry representation about restrictions on serving clients seeking second opinions
- Effective immediately from October 30, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Clause 1.(iii)(f) of the Master Circular for Investment Advisers has been revised to read:

"For clients seeking second opinion on assets under pre-existing distribution arrangement with other entity, IAs may charge fee on the assets under pre-existing distribution arrangement under AUA mode, subject to a limit of 2.5% of such assets value per annum. IAs shall, on annual basis, disclose and seek consent from such clients that apart from the advisory fees payable to the IA, the clients will be incurring costs towards distributor consideration for such assets."

Previously, any portion of AUA held by clients under pre-existing distribution arrangements was required to be deducted from AUA for fee charging purposes.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Investment Advisers:**
- May charge fees on assets under pre-existing distribution arrangements up to 2.5% per annum
- Must provide annual disclosure to clients about dual cost structure (advisory fees plus distributor consideration)
- Must obtain annual consent from clients acknowledging the dual cost structure
- Must ensure clients understand they will incur both advisory fees to the IA and distributor consideration for such assets

**For Clients:**
- Will receive annual disclosure regarding fee structure for second opinion services
- Must provide consent acknowledging awareness of dual costs (advisory fees and distributor consideration)

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 30, 2025 (immediate effect)
- **Consent Requirement:** Annual basis for affected clients
- **Disclosure Frequency:** Annual basis

## Impact Assessment

**For Investment Advisers:**
- Expands service offerings to include second opinion services on distributed assets
- Creates new revenue opportunity from previously restricted asset base
- Addresses industry concerns about service restrictions
- Requires implementation of annual disclosure and consent processes

**For Investors:**
- Provides opportunity to obtain professional second opinions on existing investments
- Increases transparency through mandatory dual-cost disclosure

**Market Impact:**
- Promotes ease of doing business for Investment Advisers
- Enhances investor protection through disclosure requirements
