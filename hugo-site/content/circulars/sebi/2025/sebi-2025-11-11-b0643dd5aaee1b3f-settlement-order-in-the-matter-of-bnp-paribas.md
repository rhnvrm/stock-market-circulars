A Show Cause Notice was issued on February 25, 2025.

## Impact Assessment

This settlement order impacts BNP Paribas and sets precedent for other DDPs and custodians handling FPI registrations. The violations relate to:

1. **Categorization Failures**: Six FPIs incorrectly granted Category II licenses when ineligible under FPI Regulations 2014
2. **Regulatory Verification**: Failure to identify that six FPIs were not regulated by UK-FCA at time of conversion to Category I under FPI Regulations 2019
3. **DDP Accountability**: Emphasizes due diligence responsibilities of DDPs in verifying eligibility and regulatory status

The proceedings under Section 15HB of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulation 43 of FPI Regulations 2019 demonstrate SEBI's focus on proper FPI categorization and compliance by intermediaries. Other DDPs and custodians should review their FPI onboarding and conversion processes to ensure compliance with eligibility and regulatory verification requirements.
