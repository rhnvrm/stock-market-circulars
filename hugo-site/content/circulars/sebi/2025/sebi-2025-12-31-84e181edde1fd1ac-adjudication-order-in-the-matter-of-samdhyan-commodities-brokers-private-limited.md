## Impact Assessment

This adjudication order highlights SEBI's focus on physical verification and location compliance for trading terminals. The case demonstrates regulatory enforcement against brokers who register terminals at specific Authorized Person locations but operate them elsewhere. The violation creates risks of:

- Unauthorized trading from unverified locations
- Lack of proper supervision of Authorized Persons
- Potential misuse of trading infrastructure
- Regulatory arbitrage and circumvention of location-based controls

The action serves as a warning to other stock and commodity brokers to ensure strict compliance with terminal registration and verification requirements. Brokers must implement robust systems to track and verify physical presence of all registered terminals at declared locations.
