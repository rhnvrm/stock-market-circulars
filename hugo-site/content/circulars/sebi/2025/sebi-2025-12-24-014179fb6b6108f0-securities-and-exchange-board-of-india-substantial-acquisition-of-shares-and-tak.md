These regulations govern the acquisition of shares, voting rights, and control over listed companies in India, establishing the framework for mandatory open offers, disclosure requirements, and takeover procedures. The regulations apply to direct and indirect acquisitions but exclude companies listed on the Innovators Growth Platform without making a public issue.

- Legal basis: Powers under Section 30 read with Section 11(2)(h) of SEBI Act, 1992
- Scope: Applies to direct and indirect acquisition of shares, voting rights, or control over target companies
- Exclusion: Does not apply to acquisitions in companies listed on Innovators Growth Platform without public issue

## Regulatory Changes

1. **2013 Amendment** - Institutional Trading Platform exemption added through SEBI (Listing of Specified Securities on Institutional Trading Platform) Regulations, 2013

2. **2015 Amendment** - Proviso substituted by Third Amendment Regulations effective August 14, 2015, clarifying exemption scope

4. **Additional amendments** - Reference to Delisting Regulations added (definition incomplete in excerpt)

These amendments demonstrate ongoing refinement of takeover regulations to accommodate new market structures and listing platforms.

## Compliance Requirements

Based on the preliminary provisions:

1. **Acquirer Obligations**: Any person acquiring shares, voting rights, or control must comply with these regulations

2. **Acting in Concert**: Persons acting together (individually or collectively) fall under acquirer definition and must comply

3. **Direct and Indirect Acquisitions**: Both types of acquisitions trigger regulatory obligations

4. **Control Triggers**: Acquisition of control through any means (shareholding, management rights, agreements) requires compliance

5. **Target Company Coverage**: Applies to all listed companies except those on Innovators Growth Platform listed without public issue

6. **Documentation**: Acquisitions must be properly documented and disclosed per regulatory requirements

**Operational Impact**: 
- Acquirers must carefully evaluate control triggers and shareholding thresholds
- Legal and compliance teams require updated regulatory text for transaction structuring
- Exemption for Innovators Growth Platform provides flexibility for startups and growth companies
- Definition of "control" encompasses multiple pathways beyond direct shareholding

**Compliance Impact**: 
- All M&A transactions in listed securities must be evaluated against these provisions
- Disclosure obligations apply to both direct and indirect acquisitions
- Persons acting in concert face combined obligation assessment
- December 2025 amendments require review of existing compliance frameworks

**Investor Protection**: Regulations ensure acquirers cannot circumvent obligations through indirect structures or concert arrangements, protecting minority shareholder interests during change of control situations.
