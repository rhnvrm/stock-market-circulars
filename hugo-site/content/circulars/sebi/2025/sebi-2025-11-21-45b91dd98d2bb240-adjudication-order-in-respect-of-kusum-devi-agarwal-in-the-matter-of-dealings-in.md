## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - Individual enforcement action with no broader market implications

**Operational Impact:** Low - Historical case involving one individual trader's activities from 2014-2015

**Regulatory Significance:** This order demonstrates SEBI's continued enforcement against market manipulation practices, particularly in illiquid derivatives segments. It reinforces the prohibition against creating artificial volumes through non-genuine reversal trades. However, as an individual adjudication order for historical violations, it has limited current market-wide impact.
