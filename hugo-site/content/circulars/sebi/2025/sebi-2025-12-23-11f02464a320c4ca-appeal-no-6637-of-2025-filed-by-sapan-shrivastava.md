The appellant sought information about HDFC Mutual Fund schemes including launch dates, trustee approvals, and SEBI approvals for six major schemes (Balanced Advantage Fund, Mid Cap Fund, Flexi Cap Fund, Large Cap Fund, Small Cap Fund, and Money Market Fund). The appeal was filed on November 26, 2025, beyond the 30-day statutory period from receipt of CPIO's response dated October 17, 2025. The appellant neither requested condonation of delay nor explained reasons for late filing.

- First appeals under RTI Act must be filed within 30 days from receipt of CPIO response
- Requests for condonation of delay must be explicitly made with valid reasons
- Information available in public domain need not be separately provided under RTI
- Information held in fiduciary capacity is exempt under Section 8(1)(e) unless larger public interest involved

## Important Dates

The order affirms standard administrative practices regarding RTI timelines and exemptions for information held in fiduciary capacity. No impact on HDFC Mutual Fund operations or any market participants.
