## Summary

The Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6645 of 2025 filed by Gobukrishnan under the Right to Information Act, 2005. The appellant sought information about complaint status, grievance handling, and mediator details. The Authority found that most queries were in the nature of grievances rather than seeking 'information' as defined under Section 2(f) of the RTI Act. The respondent CPIO adequately addressed queries by directing the appellant to publicly available information on SEBI's website and CPGRAMS portal.

## Key Points

- Appellant filed RTI application on November 12, 2025, seeking information about complaint handling and mediator details
- CPIO responded on November 26, 2025, stating most queries were grievances, not information requests under RTI Act
- Appeal filed on November 30, 2025 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00318)
- Appellate Authority upheld CPIO's response, finding queries did not qualify as 'information' under Section 2(f) of RTI Act
- For grievance DPUBE/E/2025/0000424, appellant directed to access status through CPGRAMS website
- Mediator/Conciliator information available in Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/OΙΑΕ/ΟΙΑΕ IAD-1/P/CIR/2023/145 dated July 31, 2023

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an administrative order clarifying the scope of RTI Act provisions.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. The order reinforces that:
- Grievance handling processes do not fall under RTI Act provisions
- Information about complaint status should be accessed through designated portals (CPGRAMS)
- Information about SEBI officials and mediator norms is available on SEBI's website

## Important Dates

- November 12, 2025: RTI application filed
- November 26, 2025: CPIO response provided
- November 30, 2025: Appeal filed

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** None. This is an administrative RTI appeal decision.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal. The order clarifies procedural aspects of RTI applications and distinguishes between information requests and grievances. It reinforces that complaint handling is a collective process within SEBI and that seeking action on grievances does not constitute an information request under the RTI Act. The decision has no impact on market participants or trading operations.
