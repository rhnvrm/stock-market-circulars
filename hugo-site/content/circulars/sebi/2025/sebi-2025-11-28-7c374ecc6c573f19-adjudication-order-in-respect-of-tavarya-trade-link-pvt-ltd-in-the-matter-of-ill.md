## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This order is part of SEBI's broader crackdown on manipulation in illiquid stock options segment at BSE. The fact that over 81% of trades were non-genuine indicates systemic manipulation that undermined market integrity during 2014-2015.

**Operational Impact**: Limited current operational impact as the violations occurred during 2014-2015. However, this enforcement action serves as a deterrent for similar manipulative practices.

**Entity Impact**: Tavarya Trade-Link Private Limited faces adjudication proceedings and potential penalties under Section 15HA of SEBI Act for creating artificial volume through reversal trades.

**Precedent Value**: Reinforces SEBI's zero-tolerance approach to market manipulation, particularly in illiquid segments where price discovery can be easily distorted through coordinated trading activities.
