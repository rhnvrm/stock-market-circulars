## Summary

SEBI has notified the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) (Fourth Amendment) Regulations, 2025, effective from the date of publication in the Official Gazette (December 9, 2025). The amendment modifies key definitions in the InvIT Regulations 2014, including changes to the definition of 'promoter', 'qualified institutional buyer', and 'strategic investor', introducing specific networth requirements and expanding eligible investor categories.

## Key Points

- Amendment to Regulation 2 of SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014
- Modified definition of 'promoter' to include family trusts or SEBI-registered intermediaries with networth exceeding Rs. 500 crore based on last audited financial statements
- Revised definition of 'qualified institutional buyer' to align with SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018
- Expanded definition of 'strategic investor' to include institutional investors, foreign portfolio investors (not covered under institutional investors), RBI-registered NBFCs (Middle Layer, Upper Layer, and Top Layer), and entities specified by SEBI
- Strategic investors must invest at least 5% of total InvIT offer size or amount specified by SEBI
- Compliance with FEMA 1999 and related rules/regulations/guidelines required for strategic investors
- SEBI to consult with relevant financial sector regulators before categorizing entities under strategic investor category

## Regulatory Changes

**Amendment to Definition of Promoter (Regulation 2(1)(mk)(ii)):**
- Promoter now includes family trusts or SEBI-registered intermediaries with networth exceeding Rs. 500 crore as per last audited financial statements

**Amendment to Definition of Qualified Institutional Buyer (Regulation 2(1)(ydh)):**
- Definition now aligned with Regulation 2(1)(dhh) of SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018

Strategic investor includes:
- Institutional investors
- Foreign portfolio investors not covered under institutional investors category
- Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) registered with RBI from Middle Layer, Upper Layer, and Top Layer

Investment requirement: Minimum 5% of total InvIT offer size (individually or collectively) or amount specified by SEBI, subject to FEMA 1999 compliance

Regulatory consultation: SEBI shall consult with relevant financial sector regulators before including entities from other regulated sectors under strategic investor category

## Compliance Requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** December 9, 2025 (date of publication in Gazette)
- **Reference to Original Regulations:** SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 first published on September 26, 2014

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Expansion of strategic investor definition may increase participation in InvIT offerings from NBFCs and FPIs
