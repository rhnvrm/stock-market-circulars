## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited direct market impact as this is an enforcement action against an individual research analyst. However, it sends a strong compliance message to all registered research analysts.

**Regulatory Impact**: Reinforces SEBI's zero-tolerance approach toward research analysts who promise assured returns or engage in fraudulent practices. Sets precedent for similar violations.

**Investor Protection**: Positive impact on investor protection by penalizing misleading practices and demonstrating SEBI's commitment to addressing investor complaints through SCORES mechanism.

**Industry Impact**: Research analysts must ensure strict adherence to conduct standards, avoid performance guarantees, and maintain transparent risk disclosure when marketing services. The high number of complaints (44 from 18 complainants) highlights the importance of proper client communication and ethical business practices.
