This initiative supports IOSCO's May 21, 2025 statement highlighting platform providers' critical role in combating online harm. SEBI has called for immediate prioritization of mandatory advertiser verification for securities market advertisements and verified status labeling for registered intermediary apps in the Indian market.

## Key Points

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
This initiative represents a significant step toward protecting retail investors from online investment fraud, potentially reducing fraudulent activities on social media platforms and search engines. The collaboration with global securities regulator IOSCO demonstrates the international scope of this issue.

**Investor Impact:**
Investors will benefit from enhanced safety measures when encountering investment advertisements and downloading trading applications. The verification mechanisms will help distinguish legitimate SEBI-registered entities from fraudulent operators.

**Platform Impact:**
Social media platforms and search engines will need to implement additional verification layers for advertisers in the securities domain and create labeling systems for regulated trading apps, requiring operational and technological adjustments.

**Operational Impact:**
SEBI-registered intermediaries may need to undergo additional verification processes with platforms to maintain their advertising presence and receive verified status labels on app stores.
