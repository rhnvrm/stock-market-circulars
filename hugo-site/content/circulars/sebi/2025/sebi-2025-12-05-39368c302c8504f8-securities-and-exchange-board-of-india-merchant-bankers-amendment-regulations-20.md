## Summary

SEBI has notified the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Merchant Bankers) (Amendment) Regulations, 2025, effective three days from gazette publication date (December 3, 2025). The amendments introduce significant changes to the SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992, including mandatory appointment of Principal Officer with specific qualifications, introduction of two-tier merchant banker category system, and updated registration requirements.

## Key Points

- New definition of "Principal Officer" introduced - must have minimum 5 years experience in financial markets and responsibility for merchant banking operations
- Existing merchant bankers must comply with Principal Officer requirements within timeline specified by SEBI
- Two categories of merchant banker registration established: Category-I (all permitted activities) and Category-II (restricted from main board IPO-related activities)
- Category-II merchant bankers cannot handle public issues of equity shares proposed for listing on main board of recognized stock exchanges
- Existing registered merchant bankers can re-categorize between Category-I and Category-II within SEBI-specified timeline
- Registration applications must be made in Form-A with non-refundable application fees as per Schedule-II
- Applicants must be body corporates including companies under Companies Act 2013 or Limited Liability Partnerships, excluding one-person companies and foreign companies (except licensed foreign banks)
- Regulations effective from third day of gazette publication

- **Compliance Timeline for Existing Merchant Bankers:** To be specified by SEBI separately for:

  - Category re-classification

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Two-tier system creates differentiated merchant banking landscape with specialized service providers
- Category-II merchants may focus on non-IPO activities like private placements, debt issues, and advisory services
- Enhanced professionalization through mandatory Principal Officer requirement with experience criteria

**Operational Impact:**
- Existing merchant bankers face compliance burden for appointing qualified Principal Officer
- Need for internal restructuring to accommodate Principal Officer role with decision-making authority
- Category-II entities may need to partner with Category-I for main board IPO mandates or upgrade category
- Foreign merchant bankers (except licensed foreign banks) cannot register, potentially affecting cross-border transactions

**Compliance Impact:**
- Immediate action required by existing merchant bankers to identify and appoint Principal Officer
- Decision needed on category selection based on business model and service offerings
- Enhanced accountability through Principal Officer mechanism for all merchant banking operations
- LLP structure now explicitly permitted, expanding eligible entity types

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Principal Officer requirement strengthens governance and oversight at merchant banker level
- Experience mandate (5 years in financial markets) ensures qualified leadership
- Category restrictions prevent under-qualified entities from handling complex main board IPOs
