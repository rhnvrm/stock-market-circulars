## Summary

Appeal No. 6599 of 2025 filed by Keshav Lahoti under the Right to Information Act, 2005 before SEBI's Appellate Authority. The appellant sought information regarding SEBI's regulatory actions against Growpital, including details about Rs 184 crore frozen in escrow accounts, enforcement timelines, and accountability of auditors and legal advisors. The CPIO responded that the queries sought clarifications/opinions rather than information as defined under RTI Act, and that SEBI conducts investigations confidentially without confirming or denying their existence.

## Key Points

- CPIO responded on October 23, 2025 declining to provide requested information
- Appeal filed on October 26, 2025 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00279)
- Central issue: investor funds totaling over Rs 184 crore frozen in Growpital's escrow accounts
- Growpital allegedly mobilized public funds without proper registration through extensive promotional activities
- Investigation initiated after corpus exceeded Rs 100 crore in June 2023
- Assets frozen in January 2024
- Over 5,200 investors reportedly affected
- Entities involved: Yotta Agro Ventures Private Limited, ZF Project LLPs, Farm Silo Tech LLP

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact:** Over 5,200 investors affected with Rs 184 crore frozen in escrow accounts awaiting recovery mechanism and timeline from SEBI.

**Regulatory Process:** The appeal highlights concerns about:
- Timing of regulatory intervention despite visible public operations
- Continued operations after asset freeze in January 2024
- Accountability of intermediaries (auditors and legal advisors)
- Fund recovery mechanisms and investor protection measures

**Transparency:** CPIO's response emphasizes SEBI's policy of conducting investigations confidentially without confirming or denying their existence. Final enforcement orders are published on SEBI's website when violations are established.

**Market Oversight:** Questions raised about regulatory response timelines when entities conduct extensive promotional activities for fund mobilization without proper registration under CIS regulations.
