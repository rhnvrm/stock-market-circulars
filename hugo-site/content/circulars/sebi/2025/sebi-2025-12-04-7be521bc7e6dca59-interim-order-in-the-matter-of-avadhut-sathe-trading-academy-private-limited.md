- Collected fees from course participants for activities that constituted unregistered investment advisory services
- Investigation covered analysis of stock advice during sessions, WhatsApp group recommendations, trading patterns, testimonials, and profit/loss statements of participants

## Impact Assessment

**Regulatory Impact:** This enforcement action reinforces SEBI's strict stance against unregistered investment advisory activities and fraudulent practices. It sends a clear message to trading academies and similar entities that providing stock-specific recommendations without registration violates securities laws.

**Market Impact:** Limited direct market impact as this affects specific entities rather than broad market operations. However, it serves as a deterrent for similar unregistered advisory operations.

**Investor Protection:** High impact on investor protection by addressing misleading claims and unregistered advisory services. The order protects retail investors from being misled by selective disclosure of profitable trades while concealing actual participant losses.

**Industry Impact:** Trading academies and educational institutions need to clearly distinguish between general trading education and specific investment advice. Providing stock-specific recommendations requires registration as investment adviser.
