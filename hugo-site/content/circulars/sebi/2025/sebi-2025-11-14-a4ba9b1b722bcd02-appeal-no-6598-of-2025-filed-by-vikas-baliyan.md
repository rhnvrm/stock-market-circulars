## Summary

The Appellate Authority of SEBI dismissed Appeal No. 6598 of 2025 filed by Vikas Baliyan regarding an RTI application dated September 01, 2025. The appellant sought information about Sahara India property located at Khasra No. 1469, Muzaffar Nagar, including details of attachment, disposal, and deposit of sale proceeds in SEBI-Sahara account. The appeal was dismissed as the queries were deemed to be seeking clarification/opinion/confirmation rather than 'information' as defined under Section 2(f) of the RTI Act, 2005.
