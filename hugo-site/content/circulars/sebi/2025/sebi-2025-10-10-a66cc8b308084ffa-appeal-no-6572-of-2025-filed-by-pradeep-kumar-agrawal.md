---

## Summary

Appeal No. 6572 of 2025 filed by Pradeep Kumar Agrawal under the Right to Information Act, 2005 has been rejected by SEBI's Appellate Authority. The appellant sought information about land in Village Dobra, Tehsil Bamori, District Guna (M.P.) that was classified as PACL Ltd. property with sale/transfer restrictions. SEBI's CPIO responded that the requested information is not available with SEBI. The Appellate Authority upheld this decision, noting that disposal of PACL properties and investor repayment is handled by the Justice (Retd.) R.M. Lodha Committee constituted by Supreme Court order dated February 2, 2016.

## Key Points

- RTI application filed on September 14, 2025 seeking information about land classified as PACL Ltd. property
- CPIO responded on September 19, 2025 that information not available with SEBI
- Appeal filed on September 23, 2025 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00256) claiming incomplete/misleading information
- Appellate Authority rejected appeal, citing Central Information Commission precedent that CPIO cannot invent information not in possession
- PACL property matters handled by Justice R.M. Lodha Committee under Supreme Court supervision
- Status reports, FAQs, press releases and public notices on PACL matters available on SEBI website

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an administrative RTI appeal decision.

## Compliance Requirements

No compliance requirements. The decision directs the appellant to the Justice R.M. Lodha Committee for PACL property-related matters and to publicly available information on SEBI's website.

## Important Dates

- September 14, 2025: RTI application filed
- September 19, 2025: CPIO response provided
- September 23, 2025: Appeal filed
- October 10, 2025: Appellate Authority order (implied from document date)

## Impact Assessment

This RTI appeal decision has no market impact. It is an administrative matter confirming that SEBI does not hold information about specific PACL properties, as such matters are under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court-appointed Justice R.M. Lodha Committee. The decision reinforces the established framework for handling PACL investor claims and property disposal through the designated committee rather than directly through SEBI.
