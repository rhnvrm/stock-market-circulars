## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The exemption relates to promoter group restructuring in a listed company. No change in overall promoter group holding is indicated, suggesting internal reorganization rather than change in control.

**Operational Impact:** The transaction involves consolidation within the existing promoter group through a trust structure. Vividhmargi Trust will acquire shares directly and indirectly, potentially simplifying the promoter group structure.

**Shareholder Impact:** Public shareholders are not required to receive an open offer due to the exemption granted. The promoter group shareholding pattern shows significant concentration with the Patel family and related entities holding controlling stake.

**Key Stakeholders:**
- Major individual promoters: Dinesh Shantilal Patel (9.47%), Jayshree Dinesh Patel (7.25%), Sachin Dinesh Patel (5.99%)
- Gedeon Richter Investment Management Ltd. holds 9.61% as part of promoter group
