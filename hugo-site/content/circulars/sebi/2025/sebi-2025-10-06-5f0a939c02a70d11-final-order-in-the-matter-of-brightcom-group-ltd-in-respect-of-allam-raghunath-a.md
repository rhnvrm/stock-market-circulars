- Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act, 1956
- SEBI (Procedure for holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995

## Compliance Requirements

The order highlights critical compliance failures in Brightcom Group Ltd.:

**Accounting Standards Violations:**

1. **Wrong Capitalization of R&D Costs**: Wrongly capitalized expenditure incurred during research phase and research-cum-development phase contrary to AS 26 (FY 2014-15 & 2015-16) and Ind AS 38 (FY 2016-17 to 2019-20)

2. **Delayed Impairment Recognition**: Failed to recognize impairment loss in timely manner for investments in subsidiary contrary to Ind AS 36:
   - INR 411.76 crores recognized in FY 2018-19
   - INR 868.3 crores recognized in FY 2019-20

3. **Incorrect Classification of Impairment**: Recognized impairment of assets under "Other Comprehensive Income" instead of profit and loss account (violation of Ind AS 36)

4. **Improper Asset Transfer**: Transferred "Intangible Assets under development" and "Capital Work-in-Progress" to "Intangible Assets" once a year instead of as and when asset recognition criteria is met

## Important Dates

- **Investigation Period**: FY 2014-15 to FY 2019-20
- **December 08, 2022**: Forensic Auditor submitted report
- **April 13, 2023**: Interim Order cum Show Cause Notice issued

- **February 06, 2025**: Final Order passed against BGL, its Directors and CFO
- **October 2025**: Current Final Order issued against Allam Raghunath and Subrato Saha

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Enforcement action against individuals associated with Brightcom Group Ltd. reinforces SEBI's commitment to ensuring accurate financial reporting
- Sets precedent for personal accountability of individuals involved in accounting violations
- Impacts investor confidence in companies with history of financial statement misrepresentation

**Operational Impact:**
- Listed companies must ensure strict compliance with accounting standards (AS 26, Ind AS 36, Ind AS 38)
- Directors and key managerial personnel face personal liability for financial statement violations
- Timely recognition of impairment losses is critical - delayed recognition of INR 1,280 crores over two years demonstrates severity of violations
- Capitalization of R&D costs must strictly follow prescribed accounting standards
- Asset transfers from work-in-progress to completed assets must be done as criteria are met, not annually

**Enforcement Significance:**
- Multiple enforcement actions (Interim Order April 2023, Final Order February 2025 against company, current Final Order October 2025 against individuals) demonstrate comprehensive approach
- Forensic audit mechanism utilized for complex accounting investigations
- Penalties under multiple sections (15A(b) and 15HB) indicate serious nature of violations
