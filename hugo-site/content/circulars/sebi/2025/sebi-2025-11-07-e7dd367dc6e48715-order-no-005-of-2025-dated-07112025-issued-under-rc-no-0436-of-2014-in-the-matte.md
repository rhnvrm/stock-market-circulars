## Impact Assessment

This recovery order impacts investors of Four Season Farms Limited who are owed refunds of Rs. 15.20 crore plus assured returns and interest for amounts collected in violation of CIS Regulations. The ongoing recovery proceedings since 2014 demonstrate SEBI's continued efforts to recover investor funds through attachment of properties and bank accounts. The order has limited broader market impact but is significant for affected investors and serves as a precedent for SEBI's enforcement capabilities in CIS violation cases. The prohibitory order on substantial assets (17 flats, 252+ acres land, hatchery plant) indicates the scale of the defaulter's operations and SEBI's comprehensive approach to asset recovery.
