## Impact Assessment

This is an individual enforcement action with limited market impact. The order addresses historical violations from 2014-2015 in the illiquid stock options segment at BSE. While part of a larger investigation involving 14,720 entities, this specific order affects only one individual trader. The case demonstrates SEBI's continued enforcement against market manipulation practices, even for older violations. The low trading volumes in illiquid stock options mean broader market impact is minimal, though it serves as a deterrent for similar manipulative practices.
