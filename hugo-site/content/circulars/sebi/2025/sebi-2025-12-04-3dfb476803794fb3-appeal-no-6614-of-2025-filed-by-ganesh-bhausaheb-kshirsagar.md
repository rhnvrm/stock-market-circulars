## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6614 of 2025 filed by Ganesh Bhausaheb Kshirsagar under the Right to Information Act, 2005. The appellant sought information regarding actions taken on his complaint dated May 15, 2025, and copies of documents/replies obtained during examination. The Appellate Authority upheld SEBI's denial of information under Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act, which exempts disclosure that would impede investigation processes.

## Key Points

- Appellant filed RTI application on September 25, 2025 seeking status and documents related to his May 15, 2025 complaint to SEBI
- SEBI (CPIO) responded on October 23, 2025 stating investigations are conducted confidentially and SEBI neither confirms nor denies existence of investigations
- Appeal filed on November 4, 2025 challenging adequacy of CPIO's response
- Appellate Authority upheld exemption under Section 8(1)(h) of RTI Act citing need for confidentiality in examinations/investigations
- Maintaining confidentiality prevents market speculation, protects evidence collection, and avoids unnecessary harm to third parties
- Referenced CIC precedent in Manju Devi v CPIO, SEBI (April 29, 2025) supporting denial under Section 8(1)(h)
- Any regulatory actions or penalties imposed by SEBI are publicly available on SEBI's website
