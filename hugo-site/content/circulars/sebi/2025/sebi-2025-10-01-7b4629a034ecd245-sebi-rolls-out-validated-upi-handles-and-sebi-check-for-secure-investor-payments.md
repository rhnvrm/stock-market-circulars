  payments

## Summary

SEBI has launched two critical investor protection initiatives: (1) Validated UPI Handles with exclusive "@valid" identifier for SEBI-registered intermediaries, and (2) SEBI Check verification tool. Major brokers covering over 90% of investors and all Mutual Funds have already adopted the @valid UPI handle. These initiatives establish a secure and verified payment channel within the securities market to prevent fraud and misdirection of investor funds.

## Key Points

- Exclusive "@valid" UPI handle issued by NPCI for SEBI-registered investor-facing intermediaries
- Category-specific suffixes (.brk for brokers, .mf for mutual funds) for easy identification
- Visual verification through "thumbs-up inside green triangle" icon confirms transaction authenticity
- Distinctive QR code with thumbs-up logo at center for error-free transactions
- SEBI Check tool enables independent verification of bank account details and UPI IDs
- Over 90% of investors' brokers and all Mutual Funds have already adopted @valid handle
- Facility complements existing payment modes (NEFT, RTGS, IMPS)
- SEBI Check accessible via SEBI portal (https://siportal.sebi.gov.in/intermediary/sebi-check) and Saarthi app
