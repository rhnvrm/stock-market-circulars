The appellant claims that recovery actions were taken against him due to misuse of his PAN by a fraudulent person who shares a similar name and was a director in Safal Herbs Ltd. The CPIO responded on October 23, 2025, stating that the queries sought clarification/opinion rather than "Information" as defined under Section 2(f) of the RTI Act.
