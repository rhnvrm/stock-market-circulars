## Summary

SEBI issued an adjudication order against Sachin Kumar Jhawar HUF (PAN: AALHS9592Q) for executing non-genuine reversal trades in illiquid stock options at BSE during April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015. The entity executed 4 non-genuine trades in 2 stock option contracts resulting in artificial volume of 133,500 units. The investigation was part of a larger probe into large-scale reversal of trades in BSE's stock options segment, where 2,91,744 trades (81.40% of all trades) were found to be non-genuine during the investigation period.

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal current market impact as this relates to historical trading violations from 2014-2015. The order is part of SEBI's cleanup of past manipulative practices in illiquid stock options segment.

**Operational Impact:** Limited to the specific noticee (Sachin Kumar Jhawar HUF). However, demonstrates SEBI's continued commitment to pursuing enforcement actions for market manipulation even for historical cases.

**Precedent Value:** Reinforces that:
- SEBI will pursue enforcement for creation of artificial volumes through reversal trades
- Illiquid stock options segment manipulation will be penalized
- Non-genuine trades designed to create false appearance of trading activity constitute PFUTP violations

**Entity-Specific:** The noticee was one of multiple entities involved in the broader scheme where over 81% of BSE stock option trades during the investigation period were found to be non-genuine.
