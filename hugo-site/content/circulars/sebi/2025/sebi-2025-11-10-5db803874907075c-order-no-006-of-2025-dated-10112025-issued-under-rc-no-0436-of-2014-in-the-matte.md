## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal direct market impact as this relates to specific recovery proceedings against one defaulter company.

**Investor Impact**: Significant for investors of Four Season Farms Limited who are awaiting refund of Rs. 15.20 crore plus assured returns and interest. The continuing recovery proceedings demonstrate SEBI's commitment to investor protection.

**Operational Impact**: Four Season Farms Limited remains subject to prohibitory orders preventing disposal of substantial assets including real estate properties (17 flats, 252+ acres agricultural land), hatchery operations, and other movable/immovable properties. The company's ability to operate and dispose of assets is severely restricted pending resolution of recovery proceedings.

**Enforcement Precedent**: Demonstrates SEBI's persistent enforcement action in CIS violations spanning over two decades, reinforcing deterrence against unauthorized collective investment schemes.
