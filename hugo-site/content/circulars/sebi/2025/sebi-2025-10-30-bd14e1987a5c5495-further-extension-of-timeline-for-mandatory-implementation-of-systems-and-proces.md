title: Further extension of timeline for mandatory implementation of systems and processes
  by Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs) with respect to T+0 settlement cycle
---

## Summary

SEBI has extended the deadline for Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs) to implement necessary systems and processes for enabling investor participation in the optional T+0 settlement cycle. The previous deadline of November 01, 2025 has been postponed, with further guidance on the new timeline to be communicated at a later date. This extension follows feedback from QSBs regarding challenges in ensuring timely system readiness.

## Key Points

- Timeline for QSBs to implement T+0 settlement systems extended beyond November 01, 2025
- New timeline will be communicated through further guidance at a later date
- Extension applies to QSBs designated as of December 31, 2024 meeting minimum active client parameters
- Decision made considering challenges highlighted by QSBs in ensuring system readiness
- All other provisions of the original December 10, 2024 circular remain unchanged
- Applies to recognized stock exchanges, clearing corporations, depositories, and registered stock brokers

## Regulatory Changes

This circular modifies the implementation timeline specified in SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-3/P/CIR/2025/58 dated April 29, 2025, which had set November 01, 2025 as the deadline for QSBs to put in place systems for T+0 settlement cycle participation. The original framework was introduced via SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-3/P/CIR/2024/172 dated December 10, 2024, which enhanced the scope of optional T+0 rolling settlement cycle in addition to the existing T+1 settlement cycle in Equity Cash Markets.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs):**
- Take necessary steps and implement systems for the provisions of this circular
- Make necessary amendments to relevant byelaws, rules and regulations for implementation
- Notify market participants including investors about these provisions
- Disseminate the circular on their websites

**For Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs):**
- QSBs designated as of December 31, 2024 meeting minimum active client parameters will still need to implement necessary systems and processes for T+0 settlement cycle
- Timeline for implementation extended beyond November 01, 2025
- Must await further guidance on the new implementation deadline

## Important Dates

- **October 30, 2025**: Date of circular issuance
- **December 10, 2024**: Original circular introducing enhanced T+0 settlement scope
- **December 31, 2024**: Cut-off date for QSB designation and active client parameter assessment
- **May 01, 2025**: Original implementation deadline (first timeline)
- **November 01, 2025**: Extended implementation deadline (second timeline, now further extended)
- **To be announced**: New implementation deadline for QSB system readiness

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
The extension provides additional time for market infrastructure to adapt to the T+0 settlement framework, reducing risk of implementation issues that could disrupt trading operations. The optional nature of T+0 settlement means existing T+1 settlement continues unaffected.

**Operational Impact:**
QSBs gain additional time to develop and test systems required for seamless investor participation in T+0 settlement cycles. This reduces pressure on broker technology teams and allows for more robust implementation. Stock exchanges, clearing corporations, and depositories must continue preparations while awaiting the new timeline.

**Investor Impact:**
Investors will need to wait longer before gaining access to T+0 settlement options through all QSBs. However, the extension aims to ensure better system quality and smoother user experience when implementation occurs.

**Systemic Considerations:**
The circular demonstrates regulatory flexibility in responding to industry feedback about implementation challenges, balancing the goal of faster settlement cycles with practical readiness concerns across the broker community.
