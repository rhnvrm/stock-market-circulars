## Impact Assessment

**Individual Impact**: This case demonstrates SEBI's persistent enforcement actions to recover penalties even after significant delays and legal challenges. The defaulter faces attachment of property transferred to a third party (Ms. Dipti Kishan Kotak) after the adjudication order, indicating SEBI's powers to pursue fraudulent transfers to evade penalty obligations.

**Market Impact**: Limited direct market impact as this is an individual enforcement matter. However, it serves as a precedent for SEBI's ability to trace and attach assets transferred to avoid penalty payments, strengthening deterrence against such practices.

**Legal Precedent**: Confirms application of recovery provisions under Section 28A of SEBI Act, 1992 and the Income-Tax Act's Second Schedule for attachment of fraudulently transferred properties in penalty recovery cases.
