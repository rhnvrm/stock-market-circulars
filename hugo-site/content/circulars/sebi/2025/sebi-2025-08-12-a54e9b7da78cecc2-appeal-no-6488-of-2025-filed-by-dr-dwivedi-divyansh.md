## Summary

RTI Appeal No. 6488 of 2025 filed by Dr Dwivedi Divyansh against SEBI's refusal to provide information on weekly options trading data, retail investor profitability studies, STT revenue from close-strike options, and conflict of interest declarations of derivative market committee members.

## Key Points

- Appeal filed on July 18, 2025 regarding RTI application dated June 18, 2025
- Appellant sought data on retail profitability in weekly options with strike spacing ≤0.5% from 2018-2025
- SEBI responded that no studies have been conducted on retail investor profitability in weekly options
- Request for STT revenue data from option premium turnover and conflict-of-interest declarations denied as information not available
- Appeal challenges SEBI's regulatory approach to close-strike weekly options causing over 90% retail losses
- References global regulators (ESMA, FCA, ASIC) banning close-strike expiries as exploitative

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is an administrative appeal regarding information disclosure.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. Standard RTI Act provisions apply for information disclosure by public authorities.

## Important Dates
