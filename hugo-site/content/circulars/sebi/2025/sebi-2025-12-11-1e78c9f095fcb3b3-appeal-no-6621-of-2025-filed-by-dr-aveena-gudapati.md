## Summary

Dr. Aveena Gudapati filed an RTI appeal (Appeal No. 6621 of 2025) challenging SEBI's response to her application seeking information about complaints filed against Bio Green Papers Ltd (BSE: 534535). The appellant had sought certified copies of records, investigation details, action timelines, and communications regarding alleged fraudulent AGM filings, non-disclosures, and LODR regulation violations by the company dating back to November 2022.

## Key Points

- RTI application filed on October 11, 2025, seeking information on complaints against Bio Green Papers Ltd

- Appellant filed appeal on November 13, 2025, unsatisfied with SEBI's response
- SEBI's position: neither confirms nor denies existence of investigations; maintains confidentiality of examination/investigation processes
- Any regulatory action taken by SEBI would be published on SEBI website

## Regulatory Changes

## Impact Assessment

This appeal has minimal market impact as it pertains to administrative RTI procedures rather than substantive regulatory action. The order reinforces SEBI's policy of maintaining confidentiality regarding market intelligence, complaints, and ongoing investigations. It clarifies that SEBI does not publicly confirm or deny the existence of investigations to prevent market speculation, protect evidence collection, and avoid unnecessary harm to third parties. The matter is specific to one appellant's information request and does not affect broader market participants or trading operations.
