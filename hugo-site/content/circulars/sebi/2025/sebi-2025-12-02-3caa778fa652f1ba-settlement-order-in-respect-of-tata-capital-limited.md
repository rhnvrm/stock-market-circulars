## Impact Assessment

This settlement order resolves historical violations from 2015 and 2017 CRPS issuances. The matter has no ongoing market impact as both issuances have already been redeemed (2019 and 2024). The settlement demonstrates SEBI's enforcement of private placement rules and the deemed public issue provisions when securities are widely distributed post-allotment. The relatively modest penalty reflects the historical nature of the violations and voluntary settlement approach by Tata Capital Limited.
