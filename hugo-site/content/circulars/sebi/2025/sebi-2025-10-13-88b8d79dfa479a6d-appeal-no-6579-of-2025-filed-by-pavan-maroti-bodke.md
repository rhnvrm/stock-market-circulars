---

## Summary

The SEBI Appellate Authority decided on Appeal No. 6579 of 2025 filed by Pavan Maroti Bodke against the CPIO, SEBI, Mumbai under the Right to Information Act, 2005. The appellant sought information regarding chronic complainant classification in SCORES 2.0 system, including formulation dates, criteria basis, statistics, penalties, and review processes. The Authority partially upheld the respondent's position, noting that some queries sought clarification rather than information under RTI Act.

## Key Points

- Original RTI application filed on August 30, 2025 (received through RTI MIS Portal)
- CPIO responded on September 24, 2025
- Appeal filed on September 27, 2025 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00262)
- Query 1: Adequately addressed by respondent - FAQs uploaded on SEBI website on October 29, 2024
- Query 2: Rejected as seeking clarification, not information under Section 2(f) of RTI Act
- Query 3 & 5: Information not available in format sought
- Query 4: Rejected as vague and not specific
- Authority cited precedent from Central Information Commission case Azad Singh vs. CPIO, Oriental Insurance Company Limited (March 23, 2021)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an appellate decision on an RTI matter interpreting the scope of information available under the RTI Act regarding SEBI's SCORES 2.0 chronic complainant classification system.

## Compliance Requirements

No compliance requirements imposed. The order clarifies the limits of information disclosure under RTI Act:
- Queries seeking clarification cannot be construed as seeking "information" under Section 2(f) of RTI Act
- Public authorities are not obligated to provide clarifications under RTI Act
- Information must be available and specific to be disclosed

## Important Dates

- August 30, 2025: RTI application filed
- September 24, 2025: CPIO response provided
- September 27, 2025: Appeal filed
- October 29, 2024: Latest SCORES FAQs uploaded on SEBI website (referenced in response)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is an administrative decision affecting only the specific RTI appellant. The order provides guidance on interpretation of RTI Act provisions regarding chronic complainant classification but does not change SEBI's grievance redressal framework or SCORES 2.0 operational procedures. The decision maintains that certain queries seeking clarification fall outside the scope of RTI Act obligations.
