- Original penalty imposed by QJA on April 26, 2023 in matter of Investment Research Advisor

- Defaulters prohibited from mortgaging, charging, leasing, or dealing with any property without Recovery Officer permission

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is an enforcement action implementing existing recovery provisions under Section 28A of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Sections 220-227, 228A, 229, and 232 of Income Tax Act, 1961.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Negligible. This is an entity-specific enforcement action with no implications for broader market participants or operations.

**Operational Impact:** High impact on named individuals/entities who face:
- Immediate financial liability of Rs. 6,66,000
- Severe restrictions on property transactions
- Risk of coercive recovery measures including property attachment/sale, bank account freezing, and potential arrest if non-compliant

**Recovery Measures Available to SEBI:**
1. Attachment and sale of movable property
2. Attachment of bank accounts
3. Attachment and sale of immovable property
4. Arrest and detention in prison
5. Appointing receiver for property management

**Legal Framework:** Demonstrates SEBI's use of tax recovery provisions (Income Tax Act Sections 220-232 and Second Schedule) for enforcement, providing powerful coercive tools beyond traditional securities law remedies. The deeming provision for family property transfers prevents asset dissipation strategies commonly used to evade recovery.
