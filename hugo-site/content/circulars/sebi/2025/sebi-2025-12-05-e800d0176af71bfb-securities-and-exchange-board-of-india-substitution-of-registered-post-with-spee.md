## Impact Assessment

### Operational Impact

**Medium Impact:** All market intermediaries, collective investment schemes, and entities involved in securities issuance must update their operational procedures for document dispatch. This includes:

- Modification of standard operating procedures for postal dispatch
- Updating cost calculations for postal expenses (Speed Post may have different pricing)
- Revising fund allocation mechanisms to Registrars
- Changes to logistics and vendor agreements with postal service providers

### Market Impact

**Low Market Impact:** This is an administrative amendment that does not affect trading, pricing, or market structure. No impact on securities prices or market operations expected.

### Investor Impact

**Positive Impact:** Speed Post generally offers faster and more reliable delivery compared to regular Registered Post, potentially benefiting investors through:
- Faster receipt of refund orders, allotment letters, and certificates
- Better tracking and delivery reliability
- Reduced turnaround time for document-based processes

### Cost Impact

**Marginal Cost Increase:** Speed Post services may be marginally more expensive than regular Registered Post, but the cost differential is minimal and absorbed by regulated entities as part of operational expenses.

### Compliance Complexity

**Low Complexity:** The amendment is straightforward, involving simple substitution of postal method. No new substantive compliance obligations are created; existing requirements continue with a different postal service mode.
