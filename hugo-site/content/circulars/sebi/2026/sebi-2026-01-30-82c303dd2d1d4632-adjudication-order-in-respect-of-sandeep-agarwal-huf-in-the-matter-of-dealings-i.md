## Impact Assessment

This adjudication order is part of a comprehensive enforcement action against market manipulation in the illiquid stock options segment.

The order establishes precedent for identifying and penalizing manipulative trading practices, particularly in illiquid derivative segments where such practices can significantly distort price discovery and market perception.
