- **Retail Investors**: Investors who engaged Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory may have been defrauded through promised assured returns, extortion, and threats — SEBI action offers recourse
- **Investment Advisers**: Reinforces SEBI's active monitoring of IA compliance, particularly around client conduct, complaint redressal, and cooperation with regulatory inspections
- **Market Impact**: No direct stock market impact; this is an intermediary-level disciplinary matter
- The action signals continued SEBI scrutiny of smaller, proprietary investment advisory firms operating in Western Regional Office jurisdiction
- Potential outcome includes cancellation or suspension of SEBI registration (INA000002504) depending on final order
