title: Adjudication Order in respect of Rajendra Madan Lal HUF in the matter of dealings
  in Illiquid Stock Options on BSE
---

## Summary

SEBI issued an adjudication order against Rajendra Madan Lal HUF (PAN: AALHR7398H) for engaging in non-genuine reversal trades in illiquid stock options on BSE during the investigation period from April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015. The entity was found to have executed trades that reversed buy and sell positions with the same counterparty, creating artificial volumes and false or misleading appearance of trading activity. These actions violated SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations, 2003.

## Key Points

- SEBI investigated large-scale reversal of trades in Illiquid Stock Options (ISO) on BSE for the period April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015
- During the investigation period, 2,91,643 trades (81.38% of all stock options trades on BSE) involved reversal of buy and sell positions
- Total of 14,720 entities were found to have executed non-genuine trades in BSE's stock options segment
- Rajendra Madan Lal HUF was identified as one of the entities indulging in reversal trades
- Reversal trades lacked basic trading rationale and created false or misleading appearance of trading
- Show Cause Notice was issued on July 19, 2021 by the erstwhile Adjudicating Officer
- New Adjudicating Officer was appointed on April 04, 2025 pursuant to case transfer
- Alleged violations include regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This order enforces existing SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations, 2003, specifically:
- Regulation 3(a), (b), (c), (d) - prohibiting fraudulent and unfair trade practices
- Regulation 4(1) and 4(2)(a) - prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices

## Compliance Requirements

This is an enforcement action against a specific entity. Market participants should note:
- Avoid executing reversal trades that lack genuine trading rationale
- Do not engage in trades that create artificial volumes or false appearance of trading activity
- Ensure all trades in stock options have legitimate economic purpose
- Be aware that BSE stock options trading is subject to SEBI scrutiny for manipulative patterns

## Important Dates

- **Investigation Period**: April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015
- **Show Cause Notice Issued**: July 19, 2021
- **Adjudicating Officer Appointed**: April 04, 2025
- **Order Date**: January 23, 2026 (publication date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is an individual enforcement action against one HUF entity among 14,720 entities investigated. The violations occurred over a decade ago (2014-2015) in the illiquid stock options segment.

**Operational Impact**: Low - No operational changes required for compliant market participants. The order serves as a deterrent example of regulatory enforcement.

**Systemic Significance**: The investigation revealed that 81.38% of stock options trades on BSE during the period were reversal trades, indicating widespread market manipulation. However, this specific order addresses only one participant.

**Regulatory Enforcement**: Demonstrates SEBI's continued focus on identifying and penalizing fraudulent trading practices, even with significant time lag between violation and adjudication (10+ years).
