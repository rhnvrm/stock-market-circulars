## Summary

SEBI has issued Press Release No. 14/2026 dated February 26, 2026, cautioning investors about fraudsters offering 'account handling' services. These unregistered individuals pose as expert account handlers, PMS providers, or fund managers, soliciting investors' demat/trading account credentials to operate trades on their behalf in exchange for a percentage of profits.

## Key Points

- Fraudsters present themselves as expert account handlers, PMS service providers, or fund managers promising risk-free profits.
- They require investors to share trading account login credentials and operate the accounts remotely.
- They charge a percentage of profits earned but do not share in any losses incurred.
- These account handlers are NOT registered with SEBI and fall outside SEBI's regulatory purview.
- Investors are advised to never share trading or demat account credentials with any third party.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulations have been introduced. This is a cautionary press release reminding investors of existing rules requiring dealings only through SEBI-registered intermediaries.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors must deal exclusively with SEBI-registered intermediaries.
- Investors must transact only through authentic trading apps of SEBI-registered intermediaries.
- Investors should verify the registration status of any entity at https://www.sebi.gov.in/intermediaries.html before investing.
- Authentic trading apps can be found at https://investor.sebi.gov.in/Investor-support.html.

## Important Dates

- **February 26, 2026**: Date of press release issuance by SEBI, Mumbai.

## Impact Assessment

This advisory directly impacts retail investors who may be targeted by such fraudulent account handling schemes. There is no direct regulatory burden on SEBI-registered entities. The circular reinforces existing investor protection frameworks and highlights a pattern of credential-based fraud in securities markets. Investors who have already shared credentials are at risk of financial loss with no recourse against the unregistered fraudsters.
