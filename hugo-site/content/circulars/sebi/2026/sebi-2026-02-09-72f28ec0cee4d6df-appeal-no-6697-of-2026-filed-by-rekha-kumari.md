## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority dismissed RTI Appeal No. 6697 of 2026 filed by Rekha Kumari on February 09, 2026. The appellant sought information regarding land allotment status and refund in the PACL matter. SEBI responded that the requested information is not available with SEBI, as the responsibility for property disposal and investor repayment lies with the Justice (Retd.) R. M. Lodha Committee constituted by Supreme Court order dated February 2, 2016.

## Key Points

- Appeal filed against CPIO SEBI Mumbai's response dated January 12, 2026 to RTI application dated January 06, 2026
- Appellant sought certified copy of sale deed/allotment letter, physical location details of alleged land, legal basis for refund withholding, and surrender procedure
- SEBI categorically stated requested information not available with SEBI
- Appellate Authority upheld CPIO's response citing Central Information Commission precedent that CPIO cannot invent information not in possession
- Justice R.M. Lodha Committee (constituted per Supreme Court order February 2, 2016) is responsible for PACL property disposal and investor repayment
- Appellant directed to SEBI website for publicly available PACL-related Status Reports, FAQs, Press Releases and Public Notices

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an appellate order on an RTI matter.

## Compliance Requirements

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

This order has no market impact. It is an individual RTI appeal case related to the PACL matter where the appellant sought information about land allotment and refund status. The dismissal confirms that SEBI does not hold the requested information, as the Justice Lodha Committee (established by Supreme Court order dated February 2, 2016) handles PACL property disposal and investor repayments. The order reinforces the principle that RTI responses cannot provide information not in SEBI's possession and directs investors to publicly available resources on SEBI's website for PACL-related information.
