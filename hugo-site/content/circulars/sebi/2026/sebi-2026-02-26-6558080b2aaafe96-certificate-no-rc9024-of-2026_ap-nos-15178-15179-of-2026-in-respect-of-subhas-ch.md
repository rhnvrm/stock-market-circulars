## Impact Assessment

This order has no direct market-wide impact. It is an individual enforcement action against a specific named party (Subhas Chandra Agarwala) as part of SEBI's continuing effort to recover dues from entities found liable in the Illiquid Stock Options manipulation case. The Illiquid Stock Options matter has involved hundreds of entities and SEBI continues to issue recovery certificates against defaulters. This action reinforces SEBI's commitment to enforcing penalties and recovering dues in manipulation cases, but has no systemic implications for markets or other participants.
