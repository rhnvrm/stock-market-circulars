  glitches' in Stock Brokers' Electronic Trading Systems'

## Summary

SEBI has revised the technical glitch framework for stock brokers as part of its Ease of Compliance Initiative. The revised framework streamlines eligibility criteria to apply only to brokers with more than 10,000 registered clients, exempting approximately 60% of stock brokers from this compliance requirement. Key changes include exemptions for glitches outside brokers' control, extended reporting timelines from one to two hours, consolidated reporting through a Common Reporting Platform, rationalized technology requirements based on broker size, and revised financial disincentive structures.
