The company conducted a fraudulent public issue of equity shares in 2010, raised funds from investors (primarily from the Patel community) by making false promises of stock market listing and high returns, but failed to deliver on commitments.

- Additional funds diverted: Rs. 35,50,000/- to M/s Khodiyar Foods Ltd. and Rs. 2,98,58,925/- as advance for immovable properties
- Company's stated objective was marketing of agricultural products, but directors entered real estate business without shareholder consultation

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact:** Significant negative impact on investors who purchased shares based on false promises. Investors lost both principal investment value and expected returns through non-listing and zero dividends over 11+ years.

**Market Impact:** Limited broader market impact as this involves an unlisted company, but highlights risks in unregulated public offerings and importance of regulatory compliance for investor protection.

**Regulatory Impact:** Demonstrates SEBI's enforcement reach beyond listed companies to protect investors in unlisted public companies. Reinforces consequences for fraudulent fundraising and misappropriation of investor funds.

**Corporate Governance:** Case highlights critical governance failures including misappropriation, fabricated AGMs, unauthorized business diversification, and breach of fiduciary duties by directors.

**Community Impact:** Targeted fraud against specific community (Patel community) shows vulnerability of community-based investment schemes and need for investor awareness.
