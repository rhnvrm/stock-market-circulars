title: Appeal No. 6677 of 2026 filed by Ayush Kumar Mishra
---

## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority rejected Appeal No. 6677 of 2026 filed by Ayush Kumar Mishra against the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO). The appellant sought information regarding whether SEBI accepts existing guarantee bonds from PSU bank/insurance company employees applying for Officer Grade-A positions. The appeal was rejected on grounds that the queries were seeking clarification rather than 'information' as defined under Section 2(f) of the RTI Act, 2005.

## Key Points

- RTI application filed on December 07, 2025 regarding guarantee bond acceptance for SEBI Officer Grade-A positions
- CPIO responded on December 23, 2025 that queries were seeking clarification, not information under RTI Act
- Appeal filed on January 01, 2026 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/26/00001) claiming refusal of information access
- Appellate Authority upheld CPIO's decision on January 30, 2026
- Queries related to whether SEBI accepts guarantee bonds from PSU employees (Union Bank of India, National Insurance Company Limited)
- Questions also sought clarification on bond transfer mechanism given SEBI's recruitment notification dated October 30, 2025 does not mention guarantee bond requirement

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an administrative order clarifying the scope of RTI Act obligations.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. The order reaffirms that CPIOs are not required to provide clarifications, opinions, or interpretations under the RTI Act - only existing information on record.

## Important Dates

- December 07, 2025: RTI application filed
- December 23, 2025: CPIO response provided
- January 01, 2026: Appeal filed
- January 30, 2026: Appellate Authority order issued
- October 30, 2025: SEBI recruitment notification for Officer Grade-A (referenced in application)

## Impact Assessment

This administrative order has no market impact. It pertains to internal SEBI recruitment procedures and clarifies the boundaries of information disclosure under the RTI Act. The order reinforces that RTI provisions do not obligate authorities to create, interpret, or provide opinions on information - only to disclose existing recorded information. Citation of Central Information Commission precedent (Azad Singh vs. CPIO, Oriental Insurance Company Limited, March 23, 2021) establishes that CPIOs cannot be expected to conduct research or analysis to respond to applications seeking clarifications.
