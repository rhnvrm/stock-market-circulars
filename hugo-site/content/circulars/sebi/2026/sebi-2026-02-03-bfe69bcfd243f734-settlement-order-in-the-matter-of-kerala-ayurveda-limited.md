- Post facto ratification may be considered in settlement proceedings but does not eliminate the violation

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a company-specific settlement order with no broader market implications.

**Compliance Impact**: Moderate for Kerala Ayurveda Limited. The settlement provides closure on the enforcement proceedings while the company has already implemented corrective measures through post facto ratification.

**Precedential Value**: Reinforces that material RPTs require prior shareholder approval under LODR Regulations. Demonstrates SEBI's willingness to settle non-deliberate violations through the settlement mechanism when companies take prompt corrective action.

**Investor Impact**: Low. The settlement amount is relatively small (₹5.80 lakhs) and the violation was procedural rather than substantive fraud or misrepresentation. Post facto ratification was obtained from shareholders.
