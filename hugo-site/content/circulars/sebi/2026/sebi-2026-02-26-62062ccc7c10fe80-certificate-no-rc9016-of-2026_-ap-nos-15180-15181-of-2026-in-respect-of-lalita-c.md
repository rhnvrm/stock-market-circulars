## Summary

SEBI has issued Recovery Certificate No. RC9016 of 2026 in connection with Adjudication Proceedings (A.P.) Nos. 15180 & 15181 of 2026 against Lalita Chowdhary (PAN: ACOPC0249F). The certificate is issued under Section 28A of the SEBI Act, 1992 for recovery of penalty amounts arising from adjudication proceedings in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options.

## Key Points

- Recovery Certificate No. RC9016 of 2026 issued by SEBI's Recovery Officer
- Pertains to A.P. Nos. 15180 & 15181 of 2026
- Defaulter: Lalita Chowdhary (PAN: ACOPC0249F)
- Matter: Illiquid Stock Options trading irregularities
- Certificate issued under Section 28A of the SEBI Act, 1992 for recovery of dues as arrears of land revenue

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is an enforcement action document authorizing recovery of previously imposed penalties.

## Compliance Requirements

- The named defaulter (Lalita Chowdhary) is required to pay the outstanding penalty amount as specified in the recovery certificate
- Non-compliance may result in further recovery proceedings as arrears of land revenue under applicable law
- The Recovery Officer is empowered to attach and sell properties of the defaulter to recover dues

## Important Dates

- Recovery Certificate issued: February 2026
- A.P. Nos. 15180 & 15181 of 2026 adjudication proceedings referenced

## Impact Assessment

This order has no broad market impact. It is an individual enforcement action targeting a single entity (Lalita Chowdhary) involved in the Illiquid Stock Options matter — a long-running SEBI enforcement initiative against market participants who engaged in manipulative or non-genuine trades in illiquid stock option contracts on stock exchanges. The issuance of a recovery certificate indicates the adjudicated penalty remains unpaid and SEBI is initiating coercive recovery proceedings.
