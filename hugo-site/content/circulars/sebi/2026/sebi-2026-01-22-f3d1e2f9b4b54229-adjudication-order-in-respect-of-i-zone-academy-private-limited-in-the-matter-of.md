## Impact Assessment

This adjudication order is part of SEBI's broader crackdown on manipulation in illiquid stock options trading at BSE. The finding that over 81% of trades in the stock options segment were non-genuine during the investigation period highlights systemic issues in this market segment during 2014-2015. The order serves as a deterrent against creating artificial volumes through reversal trades. Impact is primarily on the specific entity penalized, though the enforcement action reinforces market integrity standards for all participants in stock options trading.
