## Summary

SEBI has issued a Notice of Demand under Recovery Certificate No. RC9043 of 2026 against Amit Shaw (PAN: BEJPS1492A) in the matter of Illiquid Stock Options. This notice is part of SEBI's ongoing enforcement and recovery proceedings against individuals and entities found to have engaged in non-genuine trades in BSE's illiquid stock options segment. The Recovery Certificate enables SEBI to recover outstanding dues — penalties, disgorgement amounts, or interest — as arrears of land revenue under Section 28A of the SEBI Act, 1992.

## Key Points

- Recovery Certificate No. RC9043 of 2026 issued against Amit Shaw (PAN: BEJPS1492A)
- Proceedings relate to trading violations in illiquid stock options on BSE
- Notice of Demand issued pursuant to an earlier adjudication order imposing penalties/disgorgement
- Part of SEBI's wider enforcement sweep covering the BSE illiquid stock options manipulation investigation (April 2014 – September 2015 investigation period)
- SEBI acting under Section 28A of the SEBI Act, 1992 to recover dues as arrears of land revenue
- Defaulter required to make payment within the stipulated period or face attachment of bank/demat accounts and other assets

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This document enforces existing provisions of:
- Section 28A of the SEBI Act, 1992 (recovery of amounts)
- SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations, 2003
- SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995

## Compliance Requirements

- Amit Shaw (PAN: BEJPS1492A) is required to pay the demanded amount within the period specified in the notice
- Failure to comply may result in attachment and sale of bank accounts, demat accounts, and other movable/immovable property
- The defaulter must not transfer, alienate, or encumber assets during the recovery period without SEBI's permission
- Payment must be made to SEBI as directed in the notice

## Important Dates

- Recovery Certificate RC9043 of 2026 issued: February 2026
- Notice of Demand date: February 18, 2026
- Underlying investigation period (BSE Illiquid Stock Options): April 1, 2014 – September 30, 2015

## Impact Assessment

This is an individual recovery proceeding with no direct market-wide impact. It forms part of SEBI's systematic effort to recover dues from entities and individuals penalised in the BSE Illiquid Stock Options matter — one of the largest market manipulation investigations in Indian capital markets history. The broader series (RC9040–RC9044 issued concurrently in February 2026) signals continued regulatory follow-through on adjudication orders. For the named defaulter, non-compliance could result in coercive recovery action including attachment of bank and demat accounts.
