## Impact Assessment

This is an individual enforcement action with minimal market-wide impact. The order addresses historical violations from 2014-2015 involving one entity among thousands identified in a systemic investigation of illiquid stock options manipulation on BSE. The case demonstrates SEBI's continued efforts to pursue individual violators from past market manipulation schemes. Impact is limited to the specific noticee and serves as a deterrent signal to market participants against engaging in non-genuine trades that create artificial volumes.
