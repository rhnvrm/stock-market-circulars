---

## Summary

The SEBI Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6663 of 2026 filed by Dhanraj Bagrecha against the CPIO's response to his RTI application dated October 24, 2025. The appellant sought information about the 'Act' adopted by SEBI in his matter, which was rejected as vague and non-specific. The Appellate Authority upheld the CPIO's decision and noted that the appellant has been filing repetitive RTI applications on the same subject matter relating to non-receipt of shares and dividends of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (TCS).

## Key Points

- RTI application filed on October 24, 2025, received by SEBI on October 31, 2025
- CPIO responded on November 27, 2025, rejecting the query as vague and not constituting "Information" under Section 2(f) of RTI Act
- Appeal filed on December 15, 2025, received on December 18, 2025
- Appellate Authority upheld CPIO's decision citing the query lacks specificity
- Appellant has filed multiple similar RTI applications previously (Appeal Nos. 6483/2025, 5977/2024, 5543/2022, 4452/2021, 3963/2020, 3934/2020, 3544/2019, 3430/2019)
- Central Information Commission precedent cited: information sought must be clear, specific, and available in records
- Principle of 'constructive res judicata' applied to discourage repetitive RTI applications on same subject

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an administrative order on an RTI appeal.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. The order reinforces existing RTI Act requirements that:
- Information sought must be clear, specific, and believed to exist in documented form
- Applicants should seek all related information in a single application rather than filing repetitive requests
- Vague or non-specific queries cannot be processed under RTI Act

## Important Dates

- October 24, 2025: RTI application filed
- October 31, 2025: Application received by SEBI
- November 27, 2025: CPIO response issued
- December 15, 2025: Appeal filed
- December 18, 2025: Appeal received by Appellate Authority
- January 14, 2026: Appellate Authority order issued

## Impact Assessment

This order has no market impact. It is an individual RTI matter with no implications for market participants, listed companies, or regulatory framework. The decision reinforces proper use of RTI mechanism and discourages abuse through repetitive, vague applications. The underlying grievance relates to an individual's claim regarding TCS shares and dividends, which is a private matter not affecting TCS operations or market activities.
