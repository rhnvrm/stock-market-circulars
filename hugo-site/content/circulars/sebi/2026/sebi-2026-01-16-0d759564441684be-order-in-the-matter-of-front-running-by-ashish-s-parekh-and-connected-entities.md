## Impact Assessment

This enforcement action demonstrates SEBI's strict approach to front running and misuse of non-public information. The involvement of 13 connected entities including HUFs and family members shows the comprehensive nature of the investigation. The order serves as a strong deterrent against manipulative trading practices and reinforces market integrity. The calculation of unlawful gains and directions under Sections 11 and 11B indicate potential monetary penalties and market access restrictions for the noticees. This case highlights the importance of information barriers and compliance with fair trading practices in securities markets.
