The Illiquid Stock Options matter was a large SEBI enforcement action covering numerous entities found to have engaged in manipulative trading. This recovery notice represents the ongoing collection phase of those proceedings. Market impact is negligible; however, this signals SEBI's continued pursuit of penalty recovery from all entities penalized in the illiquid stock options case.
