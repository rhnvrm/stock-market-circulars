title: Extension of timeline for implementation of additional incentives structure
  for distributors for onboarding new individual investors from B-30 cities and women
  investors

## Summary

SEBI has extended the implementation timeline for the additional incentives structure for distributors who onboard new individual investors from B-30 cities and new women individual investors. The framework, originally scheduled to come into effect from February 01, 2026, will now be implemented from March 01, 2026. This extension has been granted based on industry feedback citing operational difficulties in setting up requisite systems and processes.

## Key Points

- Implementation date extended from February 01, 2026 to March 01, 2026
- Extension granted due to operational difficulties cited by the industry
- Framework covers incentives for two categories: new individual investors (new PAN) from B-30 cities and new women individual investors (new PAN) from both T-30 and B-30 cities
- All other provisions of the original circular dated November 27, 2025 remain unchanged
- Applies to all Mutual Funds, AMCs, Trustee Companies, and RTAs

## Regulatory Changes

This circular modifies only the implementation timeline of SEBI Circular No. HO/(83)2025-IMD-POD-1/I/152/2025 dated November 27, 2025. The substantive provisions of the incentive framework remain unchanged. The one-month extension provides additional time for mutual fund entities to establish necessary systems and processes.

## Compliance Requirements

- All Mutual Funds, AMCs, Trustee Companies, and RTAs must ensure their systems and processes for the additional incentive structure are ready by March 01, 2026
- Industry participants should utilize the extended timeline to address operational challenges in implementing the incentive framework
- The framework for incentivizing distributors for mobilizing investments from specified investor categories must be operational from the new effective date

## Important Dates

- **January 07, 2026**: Circular issued
- **February 01, 2026**: Original implementation date (now postponed)
- **March 01, 2026**: New implementation date for the additional incentives structure

## Impact Assessment

The extension provides operational relief to the mutual fund industry by allowing an additional month to implement the required systems and processes. This is a procedural change with minimal market impact. The delay does not affect the broader policy objective of incentivizing distributors to bring in new investors from underserved segments (B-30 cities and women investors). Industry participants benefit from additional preparation time to ensure smooth implementation of the incentive framework without compromising compliance quality.
