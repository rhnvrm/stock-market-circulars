The scheme involved posting stock recommendation tips on Telegram channels, with 10 entities (Net Sellers/Profit Makers) profiting ₹4.29 crore by selling shares after recommendations caused price/volume spikes. Three entities operated/facilitated the Telegram channels, while four entities (including UML directors and promoters) enabled the scheme.
