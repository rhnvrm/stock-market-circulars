## Summary

SEBI has issued amendments to the framework for pledging of securities through the depository system to ensure compliance with Sections 176 and 177 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The circular mandates depositories to update their Pledge Request Forms to include specific undertakings from pledgers and pledgees, maintain standardized formats, and send invocation notifications to both parties. Implementation deadline is April 6, 2026.

## Key Points

- Depositories must amend Pledge Request Forms to include undertakings from pledgees to provide reasonable notice before selling pledged assets
- Both pledgers and pledgees must undertake to comply with the Indian Contract Act, 1872, Depositories Act, SEBI Regulations, and applicable bye-laws
- Depositories shall maintain a standardized format of the Pledge Request Form
- At the time of pledge invocation, depositories must send intimation/notification to both pledger and pledgee confirming the invocation and recording of pledgee as beneficial owner
- Circular issued under Section 11(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Section 26(3) of Depositories Act, 1996

## Regulatory Changes

Three new paragraphs (4.13.3, 4.13.4, and 4.13.5) are inserted after paragraph 4.13.2 in the SEBI Master Circular for Depositories dated December 03, 2024:
