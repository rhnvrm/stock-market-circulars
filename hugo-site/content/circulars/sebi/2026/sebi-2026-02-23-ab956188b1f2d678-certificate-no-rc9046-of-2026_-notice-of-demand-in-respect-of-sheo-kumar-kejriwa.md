## Compliance Requirements

- The named entity (Sheo Kumar Kejriwal HUF, PAN: AAXHS5756C) is required to pay the demanded amount within the stipulated timeframe specified in the notice

This action is limited in scope to the named individual HUF entity and has no direct impact on broader markets or other market participants. It is part of SEBI's systematic enforcement drive to recover dues from entities penalised in the Illiquid Stock Options matter, which involved widespread manipulation in the options segment of NSE. The action demonstrates SEBI's continued commitment to enforcing its prior orders and recovering penalties from non-compliant entities.
