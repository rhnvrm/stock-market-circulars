## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** This enforcement action reinforces SEBI's commitment to maintaining market integrity in the stock options segment. The investigation revealed that over 81% of trades in BSE stock options during the investigation period were non-genuine, indicating widespread manipulation that undermined market confidence.

**Operational Impact:** Market participants engaged in options trading must implement stronger internal controls to ensure trade genuineness. Brokers and trading members need enhanced surveillance mechanisms to detect and prevent reversal trades that create artificial volumes.

**Regulatory Precedent:** This order demonstrates SEBI's continued focus on addressing historical cases of market manipulation, with adjudication proceedings initiated years after the violations occurred, showing that regulatory action can follow investigations with significant time lags.
