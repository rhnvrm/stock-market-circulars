   - "Non-convertible debt securities" terminology standardized
   - Outstanding value threshold for HVDLE classification raised from Rs. 1,000 crore to Rs. 5,000 crore
   - Regulations 16-27 applicable to entities meeting this threshold

2. **Proviso to Sub-regulation (1A):** Updated threshold references:
   - Annual issuance threshold during the financial year changed from Rs. 1,000 crore to Rs. 5,000 crore
   - Compliance trigger date clarified for entities crossing the threshold

3. **Explanation (2):** Deleted from the regulation

4. **Sub-regulation (1AA):** Terminology and threshold updates:
   - Clarified language regarding applicability of regulations 15-27
   - Provisions for entities falling below the prescribed threshold
   - New proviso added: Entities no longer meeting the revised Rs. 5,000 crore threshold will be exempt from HVDLE provisions

**Regulation 39 Amendments:**

Sub-regulation (2) replaced with new provisions concerning:
- Investor requests for sub-division, split, consolidation, renewal, and exchange of securities
- Procedures for issuing duplicate shares in cases of lost, old/worn-out, or mutilated certificates
- Documentation requirements for investor services

## Compliance Requirements

**For Debt Issuers:**

1. **Threshold Monitoring:** Entities must monitor their outstanding listed non-convertible debt securities value against the Rs. 5,000 crore threshold

2. **HVDLE Classification:** Entities with Rs. 5,000 crore or more in outstanding NCDs must comply with Regulations 16-27 of LODR

3. **Annual Issuance Tracking:** Entities issuing Rs. 5,000 crore or more during a financial year become subject to HVDLE provisions from that date

4. **Exemption for Smaller Issuers:** Entities previously classified as HVDLE under the Rs. 1,000 crore threshold but below Rs. 5,000 crore are now exempt from HVDLE-specific provisions

**For Listed Entities:**

5. **Investor Services:** Must handle investor requests for share certificate services (sub-division, split, consolidation, renewal, exchange, duplicates) according to updated procedures in Regulation 39(2)

## Important Dates

- **Notification Date:** January 20, 2026
- **Effective Date:** January 20, 2026 (date of publication in Official Gazette)
- **Applicability:** Immediate for new classifications; entities currently between Rs. 1,000-5,000 crore outstanding NCDs are relieved from HVDLE provisions

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts:**

1. **Reduced Compliance Burden:** Entities with outstanding NCDs between Rs. 1,000-5,000 crore will be relieved from stringent HVDLE compliance requirements under Regulations 16-27

2. **Proportionate Regulation:** The five-fold increase in threshold aligns regulatory burden with entity size and market significance

3. **Administrative Relief:** Smaller debt issuers will have reduced reporting and disclosure obligations

**Market Implications:**

1. **Debt Market:** May encourage more entities to issue debt securities without triggering enhanced compliance requirements

2. **Investor Protection:** HVDLE provisions remain applicable to larger, systemically important debt issuers (Rs. 5,000 crore+)

3. **Regulatory Efficiency:** Focuses enhanced scrutiny on entities with higher outstanding debt, optimizing regulatory resources

**Affected Entities:**

- Entities with outstanding listed NCDs between Rs. 1,000-5,000 crore will see immediate compliance relief
- Large debt issuers (Rs. 5,000 crore+) continue under HVDLE framework
- All listed entities must review investor service procedures under amended Regulation 39
