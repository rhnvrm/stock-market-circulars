## Impact Assessment

The impact of this order is primarily limited to shareholders of Hardcastle and Waud Manufacturing Limited. The exemption from open offer obligations means public shareholders will not receive a mandatory offer to sell their shares at a premium as part of this acquisition by Starlight Trust. The Target Company is a small BSE-listed entity with a total paid-up capital of approximately INR 68 lakhs, limiting broader market implications. Promoter concentration is high at 73.61%, with public float of only 26.39%, further constraining market impact. The order is significant for corporate governance and takeover regulatory compliance in the context of trust-based acquisition structures.
