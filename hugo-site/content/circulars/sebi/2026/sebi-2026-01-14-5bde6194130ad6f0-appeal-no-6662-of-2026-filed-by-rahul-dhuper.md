## Summary

Appeal No. 6662 of 2026 concerns an RTI application filed by Rahul Dhuper seeking information about complaints filed in July 2014 against Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) and MCS Ltd. The CPIO directed the appellant to access information through SCORES website, but the appellant contested this response claiming SCORES was not operational in 2014.
