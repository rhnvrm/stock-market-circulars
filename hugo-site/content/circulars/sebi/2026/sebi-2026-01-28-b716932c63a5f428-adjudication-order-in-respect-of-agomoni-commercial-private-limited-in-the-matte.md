## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - This action is part of SEBI's broader cleanup of non-genuine trading in illiquid stock options at BSE. While specific to one entity with relatively small volume (3.82 lakh units), it is part of a larger investigation covering 2.91 lakh trades representing 81.40% of all stock options trades during the investigation period.

**Operational Impact:** High for the Noticee - Agomoni Commercial Private Limited faces penalties under Section 15HA of SEBI Act, 1992 and potential restrictions on market participation.

**Precedent Value:** This order reinforces SEBI's zero-tolerance approach to manipulation through reversal trades and artificial volume creation in derivatives segments, serving as deterrent for similar practices.
