## Impact Assessment

This adjudication order has limited direct market impact as it addresses historical violations from 2014-2015 in the illiquid stock options segment at BSE. However, it demonstrates SEBI's continued commitment to pursuing cases of market manipulation even for relatively small individual participants (2 trades, 35,000 units). The investigation revealed systemic issues with over 81% of stock options trades being non-genuine during the investigation period, highlighting the extent of manipulation in illiquid segments. The order serves as a deterrent for similar manipulative practices and reinforces the regulatory framework against artificial volume creation and reversal trading schemes. For current market participants, it emphasizes the importance of maintaining genuine trading practices and the long-term consequences of regulatory violations.
