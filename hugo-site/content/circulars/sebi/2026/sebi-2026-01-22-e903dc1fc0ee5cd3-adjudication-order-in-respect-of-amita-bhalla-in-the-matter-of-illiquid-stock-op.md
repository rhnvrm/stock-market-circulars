## Summary

SEBI's Adjudication Order (Order/AK/GN/2025-26/31987) against Amita Bhalla (PAN: AAAPB2585M) for violations related to trading in illiquid stock options on BSE. During the investigation period (April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015), SEBI observed large-scale reversal of trades in BSE's stock options segment creating artificial volumes. Amita Bhalla executed 4 non-genuine trades in 2 stock options contracts resulting in artificial volume of 2,60,000 units. The case was initiated under Section 15-I of SEBI Act, 1992 for alleged violations of PFUTP Regulations, 2003.

## Impact Assessment

This adjudication order is part of SEBI's broader investigation into systemic manipulation of illiquid stock options on BSE. The finding that 81.40% of all trades in the stock options segment were non-genuine indicates widespread market manipulation during the investigation period. For individual market participants, this reinforces SEBI's strict enforcement against creating artificial volumes and executing non-genuine trades. The order demonstrates regulatory vigilance in maintaining market integrity, particularly in illiquid segments where manipulation is easier. While the individual impact of Amita Bhalla's trades (2,60,000 units across 4 trades) is relatively small, it forms part of a larger pattern of market abuse that undermined the credibility of BSE's stock options segment.
