  Platforms
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued a circular under the Ease of Doing Investment (EoDI) initiative requiring all SEBI-regulated entities and their agents to disclose their registered name and SEBI registration number on Social Media Platforms (SMPs). The measure aims to help investors distinguish content posted by registered intermediaries from unregistered entities, thereby strengthening investor protection and transparency in the securities market.

## Key Points

- All persons regulated by SEBI under Section 12 of the SEBI Act, 1992 must disclose their registered name and registration number on social media handles
- Disclosure is required on the **home page** of social media handles and at the **beginning of each video/content** related to the securities market
- Applies to content on all major platforms: YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Threads, Telegram, Reddit, and others — whether in closed or public groups
- Entities with a **single SEBI registration** must state the registered name and registration number near the handle name and at the start of each video/content
- Entities with **multiple SEBI registrations** must provide a weblink on the home page directing to a webpage listing all registrations, and disclose the specific registration relevant to each video/content
- Agents of regulated entities (e.g., mutual fund distributors, portfolio management service distributors) are similarly required to display their registration details

## Regulatory Changes

- New disclosure obligation introduced for SEBI-regulated entities and their agents operating on Social Media Platforms
- Entities covered include: Stock Brokers, Depository Participants, RTAs, Investment Advisers, Research Analysts, InvITs, REITs, SMREITs, AIFs, Portfolio Managers, CIS, Mutual Funds/AMCs/AMFI, and all persons regulated by the Board
- Part of SEBI's broader Ease of Doing Investment (EoDI) framework aimed at improving investor confidence and market transparency
- Reference regulation: Chapter IIIA — Explanation 1 of Regulation 16A, SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008

## Compliance Requirements

- Display SEBI registered name and registration number prominently on the **home page** of all social media handles used for securities market content
- Include the registered name and registration number at the **beginning of every video, short, or content** uploaded relating to the securities market
- Entities with multiple registrations must maintain and link to a comprehensive listing of all SEBI registrations from their social media home pages
- Agents must display their own registration details in addition to (or separate from) the principal regulated entity
- Applies to all content whether posted in closed groups or publicly available groups

## Important Dates

- Circular issued: 26 February 2026
- Reference number: HO/(79)2026-MIRSD-PODMMC
- Effective date: Not explicitly stated in the available excerpt; regulated entities should refer to the full circular PDF for implementation timelines

## Impact Assessment

- **Operational impact**: All SEBI-regulated intermediaries with a social media presence will need to update their handle profiles and implement disclosure overlays or text in video/content production workflows
- **Investor benefit**: Investors will be able to readily verify whether content creators are SEBI-registered, reducing the risk of falling prey to unregistered advisers or fraudulent actors
- **Compliance burden**: Moderate — primarily a one-time profile update and an ongoing content-creation discipline; no trading or financial reporting implications
- **Broader context**: Complements SEBI's ongoing crackdown on unregistered investment advisers and finfluencers operating on social media without regulatory oversight
