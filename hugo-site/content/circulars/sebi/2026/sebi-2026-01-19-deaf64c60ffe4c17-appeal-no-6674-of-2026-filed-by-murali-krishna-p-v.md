## Summary

The SEBI Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6674 of 2026 filed by Murali Krishna P V against the denial of information under the Right to Information Act, 2005. The appellant had sought information regarding SEBI's actions after a Jane Street reporter incident and measures to prevent recurrence. The Authority upheld the CPIO's rejection, ruling that the queries were vague, non-specific, and hypothetical in nature, and therefore did not constitute 'information' under Section 2(f) of the RTI Act.

## Key Points

- RTI application filed on December 02, 2025 seeking information about SEBI's response to Jane Street reporter incident
- CPIO responded on December 29, 2025 denying the information request
- Appeal filed on December 29, 2025 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00342)
- Appellant sought three categories of information: meeting proceedings, preventive steps, and refund proposals
- Queries 1 and 2 rejected as vague and non-specific
- Query 3 rejected as hypothetical and seeking clarification/opinion
- Authority cited precedents from Central Information Commission supporting the denial

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an administrative order on an RTI appeal.

## Compliance Requirements

None. This order clarifies that RTI queries must be clear, specific, and relate to existing documented information rather than hypothetical scenarios or opinions.

## Important Dates

- December 02, 2025: RTI application filed
- December 29, 2025: CPIO response issued
- December 29, 2025: Appeal filed

## Impact Assessment

The order serves as guidance for future RTI applicants regarding the acceptable scope of information requests under the RTI Act.
