## Summary

SEBI has issued detailed implementation guidelines for the SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Amendment Regulations, 2025, which come into effect on January 03, 2026. The circular specifies phased compliance timelines for revised capital adequacy and new liquid net worth requirements for Merchant Bankers. Category I MBs must achieve Rs. 50 crore net worth and Rs. 12.5 crore liquid net worth, while Category II MBs require Rs. 10 crore net worth and Rs. 2.5 crore liquid net worth by January 02, 2028 through a two-phase implementation.

## Key Points

- Amendment Regulations effective from January 03, 2026

- New applicants from January 03, 2026 must meet full requirements immediately
- Existing MBs must intimate SEBI of their chosen category by January 02, 2027
- MBs failing Category I requirements will be automatically designated as Category II
- MBs failing Category II requirements cannot undertake fresh permitted activities
- Half-yearly certification of net worth and liquid net worth compliance required

## Important Dates

- **December 05, 2025**: SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Amendment Regulations, 2025 notified
- **January 03, 2026**: Effective date of Amendment Regulations
- **January 02, 2027**:

  - Deadline for intimating chosen category to SEBI
  - Existing MBs must meet interim capital requirements
- **January 02, 2028**: Phase II final compliance deadline for full capital adequacy and liquid net worth requirements

## Impact Assessment

**Industry Impact:**
This circular creates significant capital pressure on Merchant Bankers, particularly smaller entities. The phased approach provides 2 years for full compliance, but the requirements represent substantial increases (Category I: 100% increase in net worth from Rs. 25 cr to Rs. 50 cr).

**Operational Impact:**
- Smaller MBs may need to raise additional capital or downgrade to Category II
- MBs unable to meet Category II requirements will face business restrictions on fresh activities
- Increased compliance burden through mandatory half-yearly CA certifications
- Potential market consolidation as smaller players may exit or merge

**Risk Mitigation:**
The higher capital requirements aim to strengthen financial stability of intermediaries and protect investor interests by ensuring MBs have adequate financial resources to conduct operations and manage risks effectively.
