## Impact Assessment

This order has minimal broader market impact as it targets a specific individual (Makkena Rama Krishna) in relation to Exelon Infrastructure Ltd and Venus Power Ventures (India) Limited. The existence of three recovery certificates — one dating back to 2019 — indicates a prolonged failure to satisfy dues. The action is routine enforcement by SEBI to recover outstanding amounts. Impact is confined to the defaulter whose assets will be restricted pending full recovery of dues under the three recovery certificates.
