Nos. 15168 & 15169 of 2026 against Ritu Agarwal (PAN: ACBPC0253E) for recovery of outstanding dues in the matter of Illiquid Stock Options. This is part of SEBI's ongoing enforcement action against entities found to have engaged in manipulative trading in illiquid stock options on Indian exchanges.

## Key Points

- Attachment Proceedings Nos. 15168 & 15169 of 2026 initiated for recovery of dues
- Action taken in the matter of Illiquid Stock Options, a major SEBI enforcement case
- Certificate authorises attachment and sale of the defaulter's assets to recover outstanding penalties/disgorgement amounts

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Ritu Agarwal is required to pay the outstanding dues as specified in the Recovery Certificate
- Banks, depositories, and other entities holding the defaulter's assets may be directed to attach such assets pursuant to the Attachment Proceedings

The action signals continued enforcement rigour by SEBI against identified defaulters who have not complied with earlier penalty/disgorgement orders.
