## Summary

SEBI has issued an adjudication order (Order No. Order/JS/DP/2025-26/31969) against Vikram Anand HUF (PAN: AAJHV0926R) for alleged violations relating to non-genuine trading in Illiquid Stock Options on BSE during the period April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015.

## Impact Assessment

This adjudication order has limited direct market impact as it addresses historical violations by a single HUF entity during 2014-2015. However, it demonstrates SEBI's continued enforcement against manipulation in illiquid stock options segment. The order reinforces regulatory oversight on trading practices and serves as a deterrent against creation of artificial volumes through reversal trades. The investigation's scope covering 14,720 entities indicates widespread concern about trading practices in illiquid stock options during that period. Market participants trading in options should ensure genuine trading rationale and avoid patterns that could be construed as creating false market appearance.
