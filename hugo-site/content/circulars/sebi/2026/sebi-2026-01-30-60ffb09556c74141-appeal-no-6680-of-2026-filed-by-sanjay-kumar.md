## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6680 of 2026 filed by Sanjay Kumar against the CPIO's response to his RTI application. The appellant had sought certified copy of any registration done by SEBI against Bahubala Pvt. Ltd (CIN: U70100JH2022PTC018477) and whether the company is authorized to collect funds from investors. The appeal was dismissed as the query was deemed to be seeking clarification/opinion rather than 'information' as defined under Section 2(f) of the RTI Act.

## Key Points

- RTI application filed on January 02, 2026 seeking information about SEBI registration of Bahubala Pvt. Ltd
- CPIO responded on January 05, 2025 stating query was vague and seeking clarification, not information
- Appeal filed on January 06, 2026 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/26/00003)
- Appellate Authority upheld CPIO's response citing that queries seeking explanation/opinion/clarification cannot be construed as 'information' under RTI Act
- CPIO had directed appellant to SEBI website for list of registered intermediaries

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced by this order.

## Compliance Requirements

No compliance requirements applicable. This is an administrative order on RTI procedures.

## Important Dates

- January 02, 2026: RTI application filed
- January 05, 2025: CPIO's response (appears to be typo in document)
- January 06, 2026: Appeal filed
- January 30, 2026: Appeal order issued

## Impact Assessment

This order has no market or operational impact. It is a procedural order clarifying that RTI applications cannot be used to seek opinions, clarifications or confirmations from SEBI. The order reaffirms that CPIO is only required to provide existing information on record and cannot create, interpret or compile information as per applicant's desire. Investors and market participants seeking information about registered intermediaries can access the publicly available list on SEBI's website.
