**Impact on Named Individuals:** High - The attachment of bank and demat accounts significantly restricts the financial activities of Mr. Yogendra Bisay and Mr. Jitendra Bisay until the recovery dues are settled.

**Market Impact:** Low - This is an enforcement action against specific individuals and does not affect broader market operations or trading activities.

**Institutional Impact:** Medium - Banks and depositories holding accounts for these individuals must implement the attachment orders and ensure compliance with SEBI's recovery proceedings.
