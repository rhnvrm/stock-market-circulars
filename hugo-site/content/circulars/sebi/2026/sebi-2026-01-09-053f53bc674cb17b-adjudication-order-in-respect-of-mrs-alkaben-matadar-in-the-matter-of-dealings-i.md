title: Adjudication Order in respect of Mrs. Alkaben Matadar in the matter of dealings
  in Illiquid Stock Options on BSE
---

## Summary

SEBI issued Adjudication Order No. Order/JS/VC/2025-26/31957 against Mrs. Alkaben Matadar (PAN: AGAPM3957C) for alleged violations of PFUTP Regulations related to non-genuine trading activities in Illiquid Stock Options on BSE. During the investigation period (April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015), SEBI observed large-scale reversal of trades creating artificial volumes. Mrs. Matadar was identified as one of 14,720 entities executing such reversal trades. The adjudication proceedings were initiated under Section 15-I of SEBI Act, 1992 for alleged violations of regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a) of PFUTP Regulations.

## Key Points

- Investigation revealed 2,91,744 trades (81.41% of all trades) in BSE stock options segment involved reversal of buy and sell positions during the investigation period
- Reversal trades involved entities reversing their buy or sell position in a contract with subsequent sell or buy position with the same counterparty
- Such trades were deemed non-genuine, lacking basic trading rationale and creating false or misleading appearance of trading
- 14,720 entities were found to have executed non-genuine trades in BSE's stock options segment
- Mrs. Alkaben Matadar was identified as one of the entities executing such manipulative reversal trades
- Show Cause Notice dated March 07, 2022 was issued to the Noticee
- Adjudicating Officer was appointed on April 03, 2025 under Section 15-I of SEBI Act

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is an enforcement action under existing SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations, 2003.

## Compliance Requirements

Not applicable - this is an individual adjudication order, not a circular introducing new compliance requirements.

## Important Dates

- Investigation Period: April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015
- Show Cause Notice: March 07, 2022
- Adjudicating Officer Appointment: April 03, 2025
- Order Date: January 2026 (document incomplete)

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this is a retrospective enforcement action against an individual entity for historical violations during 2014-2015. The order serves as a deterrent against manipulative trading practices in illiquid stock options. The case is part of a broader investigation involving 14,720 entities, indicating systemic issues in BSE's stock options segment during that period. However, the individual impact on current market operations is minimal.
