---

## Summary

The Appellate Authority dismissed RTI appeals filed by Dibakar Sarkar seeking detailed marks and category information of finally selected candidates in SEBI Grade A (Assistant Manager) 2024 recruitment. The appellant had requested actual marks obtained by candidates in Phase I, Phase II, and Interview stages, along with their category details (GEN/OBC/EWS/SC/ST) in a tabulated format. SEBI's CPIO responded that the information is not maintained in the requested format, though aggregate data is available on SEBI's website under the careers section.

## Key Points

- Two identical RTI applications filed on November 18, 2025 and December 12, 2025
- First application was closed as it was not viewable on RTI MIS portal
- CPIO responded on January 08, 2026 that requested information is not maintained in the format sought
- Appellant sought actual marks of each selected candidate across all exam phases and interview
- Appellant also requested category-wise breakdown of selected candidates with roll numbers
- CPIO informed that marks of candidates who qualified for interview and minimum marks of last selected candidate are available on SEBI website
- Appeal filed on grounds of incomplete, misleading or false information
- Appellate Authority cited Delhi High Court judgment in Registrar, Supreme Court of India vs. Commodore Lokesh K. Batra establishing that RTI Act does not require public authorities to create, collect or collate information not already available

## Impact Assessment

This order has no market impact and is purely administrative in nature. It pertains to transparency in SEBI's internal recruitment process for Grade A positions. The decision reinforces the established legal principle that RTI applicants cannot compel public authorities to generate new formats or compile data not already maintained. While it limits granular disclosure of individual candidate performance data, SEBI continues to provide aggregate recruitment information on its public website including qualifying marks and selection lists.
