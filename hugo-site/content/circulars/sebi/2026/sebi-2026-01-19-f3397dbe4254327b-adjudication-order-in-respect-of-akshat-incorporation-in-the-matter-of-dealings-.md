## Summary

SEBI issued an adjudication order (Order/JS/YK/2025-26/31976) under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act against Akshat Incorporation (PAN: ABAFA1594L) for engaging in manipulative trading practices in illiquid stock options on BSE. During the investigation period from April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015, the entity executed reversal trades that created artificial volumes and false appearance of trading activity. The investigation revealed that 2,91,643 trades (81.38% of all stock option trades on BSE) involved reversal of buy and sell positions, with 14,720 entities found participating in such non-genuine trades. A Show Cause Notice was issued on August 1, 2022, and adjudication proceedings were initiated for violations of PFUTP Regulations.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is an individual enforcement action against one entity among 14,720 identified participants in historical manipulation. The trades occurred over 10 years ago (2014-2015) and do not affect current market operations.

**Operational Impact:** Low - No changes to trading rules or operational procedures. Reinforces existing prohibition against creating artificial volumes and manipulative trading.

**Precedential Value:** Medium - Part of large-scale enforcement action against illiquid stock option manipulation on BSE. Demonstrates SEBI's commitment to pursuing historical violations and maintaining market integrity.

**Systemic Significance:** Low - Individual case within broader investigation. While the overall scheme involved significant market abuse (81.38% of trades), this specific order addresses one participant's violations.
