## Impact Assessment

This is an internal promoter group restructuring involving trusts associated with the Mohanka family. The exemption allows the Acquirer Trusts to acquire shares without triggering mandatory open offer requirements. Since this appears to be a reorganization within the existing promoter group (currently holding 67.27%), the impact on public shareholders and market operations is limited. No change in ultimate control or management is anticipated. The transaction facilitates estate planning or succession planning within the promoter family without requiring a public offer.
