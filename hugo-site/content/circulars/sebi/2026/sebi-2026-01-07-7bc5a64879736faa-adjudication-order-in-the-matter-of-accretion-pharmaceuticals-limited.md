## Summary

SEBI's Adjudication Officer issued an order (Order/AK/RK/2025-26/31951-31952) against Accretion Pharmaceuticals Limited (Issuer) and Jawa Capital Services Private Limited (BRLM) for violations of SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018 and SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992. The violations occurred when the issuer's management made forward-looking revenue projections for FY 2025-26, 2026-27, and 2027-28 during an investors' meet held one day before the issue opening, which were not disclosed in the DRHP or RHP. The BRLM failed to exercise due diligence and independent professional judgment despite being present at the investors' meet.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - This enforcement action reinforces disclosure standards for IPO processes and sets precedent for controlling information flow during investor interactions. Affects practices of issuers and merchant bankers in managing pre-IPO communications.

**Regulatory Impact:** High - Strengthens SEBI's oversight of IPO disclosure practices and merchant banker conduct. Clarifies that verbal communications during investor meets are subject to same disclosure standards as written documents.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Issuers and merchant bankers must implement stricter controls over investor presentations, ensuring alignment with offering documents. May require pre-approval processes for all investor meeting materials and management presentations.

**Investor Protection:** High - Ensures retail and institutional investors receive complete and consistent information across all communication channels during IPO process, preventing information asymmetry between different investor groups.
