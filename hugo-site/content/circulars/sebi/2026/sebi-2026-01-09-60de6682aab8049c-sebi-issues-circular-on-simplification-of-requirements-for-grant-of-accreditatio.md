title: SEBI Simplifies Accreditation Requirements for Investors
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued a circular simplifying the accreditation requirements for investors in Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) based on industry feedback. The key changes include allowing AIF investment managers to raise commitments from investors pending receipt of formal accreditation certificates, and making detailed net-worth breakup optional in net-worth certificates issued by chartered accountants.

## Key Points

- Investment managers of AIFs can now raise commitments from investors before receiving formal accreditation certificates from accreditation agencies
- Commitments can be raised based on investment manager's own assessment of investor eligibility
- Detailed break-up of net-worth in accreditation certificates is no longer mandatory
- Chartered accountants are not required to specify actual net-worth amounts in net-worth certificates (now optional)
- Changes implemented to ensure ease of doing business for AIFs and investors

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has modified the investor accreditation framework for AIFs by:

1. **Interim Commitment Acceptance**: Permitting investment managers to accept commitments from investors pending formal accreditation, relying on their internal assessment of investor eligibility criteria

2. **Net-Worth Certificate Simplification**: Removing the requirement for detailed net-worth breakup and making the disclosure of actual net-worth figures optional for certifying chartered accountants

These changes streamline the onboarding process for investors while maintaining investor protection standards.

## Compliance Requirements

**For AIF Investment Managers:**
- Must conduct their own assessment of investor eligibility before accepting commitments pending formal accreditation
- Can proceed with fundraising activities without waiting for accreditation agency certificates

**For Accreditation Agencies:**
- Continue to issue accreditation certificates as per revised simplified requirements
- Net-worth certificates no longer require detailed breakup of assets and liabilities

**For Chartered Accountants:**
- May issue net-worth certificates without specifying actual net-worth amounts (optional disclosure)
- Not required to provide detailed breakup of net-worth components

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: January 9, 2026
- **Effective Date**: Immediate (from date of circular issuance)

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts:**

1. **Faster Fundraising**: AIFs can accelerate their fundraising timelines by accepting commitments before formal accreditation completion

2. **Reduced Documentation**: Simplified net-worth certification requirements reduce paperwork and administrative burden for investors and chartered accountants

3. **Operational Efficiency**: Investment managers gain flexibility in investor onboarding while maintaining due diligence responsibilities

4. **Ease of Business**: Addresses industry concerns about procedural delays in the accreditation process

**Considerations:**

1. **Responsibility Shift**: Investment managers bear greater responsibility for accurate assessment of investor eligibility

2. **Risk Management**: Firms must ensure robust internal processes for evaluating investor accreditation criteria without agency certification

Overall, this circular represents a regulatory ease measure that maintains investor protection standards while improving operational efficiency in the AIF ecosystem.
