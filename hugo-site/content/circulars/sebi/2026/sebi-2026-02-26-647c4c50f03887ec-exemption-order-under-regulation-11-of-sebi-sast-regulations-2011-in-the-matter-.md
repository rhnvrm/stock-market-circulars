## Summary

SEBI has issued an exemption order (WTM/KCV/CFD/24/2025-26) under Section 11(1) and Section 11(2)(h) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 11(5) of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011.

## Key Points

- **Target Company:** Gujarat Themis Biosyn Limited, incorporated May 31, 1969, listed on BSE and NSE; registered office at Plot No 69-A, GIDC Industrial Estate, Dist. Valsad, Vapi, Gujarat – 396 195

- **Public shareholding:** 29.14% (3,17,47,182 shares)
- **Key promoter entities:** Pharmaceutical Business Group (India) Limited (PBGL) holds 47.02%; Themis Medicare Limited (TML) holds 23.19%

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This order applies existing provisions of:
- Section 11(1) and Section 11(2)(h) of the SEBI Act, 1992
- Regulation 11(5) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011
- Regulations 3(1), 4, and 5 of the Takeover Regulations (from which exemption is sought)

## Compliance Requirements

- The exemption is specific to the proposed acquisition by Vividhmargi Trust as described in the Revised Application dated September 03, 2025
- The Acquirer Trust must comply with any conditions stipulated in the full exemption order
- Post-acquisition disclosures under SEBI (SAST) Regulations and SEBI (PIT) Regulations must be made as applicable
- Any deviation from the proposed acquisition structure may require fresh regulatory review

## Important Dates

- **May 30, 2025:** Original exemption application filed by Mr. Dinesh Shantilal Patel (trustee, Vividhmargi Trust)
- **September 03, 2025:** Revised Application submitted with corrected shareholding pattern and paid-up share capital
- **June 30, 2025:** Reference date for shareholding pattern disclosed in the application
- **Order reference:** WTM/KCV/CFD/24/2025-26

## Impact Assessment

**Company-level:** The exemption order facilitates a promoter group restructuring via a trust structure without triggering a mandatory open offer, which could otherwise require the acquirer to make a public offer to minority shareholders. Existing public shareholders (29.14%) are not required to be given an exit opportunity through an open offer under this exemption.

**Market impact:** Limited to Gujarat Themis Biosyn Limited. The promoter group's overall shareholding at 70.86% remains dominant; the acquisition is an intra-promoter group reorganisation rather than a change in control. No significant impact on secondary market trading is expected.

**Regulatory precedent:** Affirms SEBI's willingness to grant exemptions for intra-group trust-based restructuring under Regulation 11 of the Takeover Regulations where the spirit of investor protection is not compromised.
