## Summary

SEBI has issued Certificate No. RC9041 of 2026, constituting a Notice of Demand against Calypso Tieup and Finco Private Limited (PAN: AABCC2133Q) for recovery of outstanding dues arising from SEBI's enforcement action in the matter of Illiquid Stock Options. This recovery certificate empowers SEBI to recover the specified amount as arrears of land revenue under Section 28A of the SEBI Act, 1992.

## Key Points

- Recovery Certificate No. RC9041 of 2026 issued by SEBI against Calypso Tieup and Finco Private Limited
- Entity's PAN: AABCC2133Q
- Pertains to SEBI's ongoing enforcement action in the Illiquid Stock Options matter on BSE
- Notice of Demand issued under Section 28A of the SEBI Act, 1992
- The certificate enables recovery of dues as arrears of land revenue through the designated authority
- Non-payment may result in attachment and sale of movable/immovable property

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is an enforcement/recovery action pursuant to an existing SEBI order in the Illiquid Stock Options matter.

## Compliance Requirements

- Calypso Tieup and Finco Private Limited is required to pay the demanded amount as specified in the recovery certificate
- Payment must be made within the stipulated timeframe to avoid further recovery action including attachment of assets
- The entity must comply with the original SEBI order that gave rise to this demand

## Important Dates

- Certificate Issue Date: February 18, 2026
- Demand period and payment deadline: As specified in Certificate No. RC9041 of 2026

## Impact Assessment

This recovery action has minimal broader market impact. It is targeted enforcement against a single entity (Calypso Tieup and Finco Private Limited) found to have violated SEBI regulations in the Illiquid Stock Options matter. The illiquid stock options enforcement has been a major SEBI initiative targeting manipulation of BSE's illiquid options segment, and such recovery certificates represent the final stage of enforcement where SEBI recovers penalties/disgorgement amounts from non-compliant entities. Market participants and investors are not directly affected unless they have dealings with the named entity.
