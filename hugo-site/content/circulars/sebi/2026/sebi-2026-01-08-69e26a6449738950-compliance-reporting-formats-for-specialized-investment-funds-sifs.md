---

## Summary

SEBI has issued standardized compliance reporting formats for Specialized Investment Funds (SIFs) to ensure uniformity and clarity. The circular modifies existing Compliance Test Report (CTR) and Half-Yearly Trustee Report (HYTR) formats by adding SIF-specific sections. AMCs managing SIFs must report additional compliance parameters under Part IV of CTR, while Trustees must include Clause 72A in HYTR submissions. These provisions are effective from January 08, 2026.

## Key Points

- All reporting requirements applicable to mutual funds under SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 also apply to SIFs as per Regulation 49V(2)
- Compliance Test Report (CTR) format modified to include new Part IV covering SIF-specific compliance parameters
- Half-Yearly Trustee Report (HYTR) format modified to include new Clause 72A for SIF compliance
- AMCs managing SIFs must submit Part IV as part of their regular CTR submissions for Mutual Funds
- Trustees/Trustee Companies managing SIFs must report under Clause 72A in their HYTR submissions
- Circular references SEBI's February 27, 2025 circular establishing the SIF regulatory framework

## Regulatory Changes

**HYTR Format Modification:**

## Compliance Requirements

- **Reference Date:** February 27, 2025 (original SIF regulatory framework circular)
- **Master Circular Reference:** June 27, 2024 (MF Master Circular)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:**
- AMCs and Trustees managing SIFs must modify their compliance reporting processes to incorporate new formats
- Additional reporting burden for entities managing both traditional mutual funds and SIFs

- Strengthens regulatory framework for specialized investment products catering to sophisticated investors

**Compliance Impact:**

- Regular monitoring required for SIF-specific parameters including minimum investment thresholds, fund manager qualifications, investment restrictions, and fee limitations
- Integration required between SIF compliance tracking and existing mutual fund reporting infrastructure
