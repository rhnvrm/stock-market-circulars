## Impact Assessment

This is an individual adjudication order with minimal market-wide impact. The order addresses historical trading violations from 2014-2015 in the illiquid stock options segment on BSE. While part of a larger investigation involving over 14,700 entities, this specific order affects only one individual trader. The case reinforces SEBI's continued focus on eliminating manipulative practices in derivatives segments, particularly in illiquid contracts where artificial volume creation is easier to execute. Market participants engaged in options trading should ensure their trading strategies have genuine economic rationale and avoid patterns that could be construed as creating artificial volumes or misleading market appearance.
