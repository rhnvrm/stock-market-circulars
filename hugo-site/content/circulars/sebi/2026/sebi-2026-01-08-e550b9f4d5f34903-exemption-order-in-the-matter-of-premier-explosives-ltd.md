## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is an inter-family transfer to a trust structure with no change in effective control. Public shareholding (58.67%) remains unchanged.

**Operational Impact:** The transfer represents estate planning and succession structuring within the promoter family. No impact on company operations or management.

**Investor Impact:** No mandatory open offer required, so no exit opportunity or pricing implications for public shareholders. The trust structure provides continuity of promoter holding through generations.

**Control Structure:** Effective control remains with the same family members through trustee and beneficiary arrangements. The irrevocable discretionary nature provides flexibility in wealth distribution among lineal descendants.
