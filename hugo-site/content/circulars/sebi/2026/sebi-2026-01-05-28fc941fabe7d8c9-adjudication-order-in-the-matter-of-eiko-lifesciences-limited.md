## Summary

SEBI issued Adjudication Order No. Order/AK/RK/2025-26/31950 against Lenus Finvest Private Limited (PAN: AACCL9703E) for violations of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 in connection with the acquisition of shares of Eiko Lifesciences Limited. The violations relate to failure to disclose pledge and unpledged transactions, and failure to provide annual declarations regarding encumbrances as required under Regulation 31 of SAST Regulations. The adjudication proceedings were initiated following examination of the Draft Letter of Offer submitted for the acquisition.

## Key Points

- Noticee cited exemption under Regulation 31(2) in their reply dated October 09, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This is an entity-specific enforcement action with limited broader market impact. The order addresses procedural compliance issues related to pledge disclosures during a takeover transaction. The case highlights SEBI's continued focus on ensuring transparency in shareholding patterns and encumbrances during acquisitions. The defense raised by Lenus Finvest regarding the distinction between margin pledges (as broker risk management tools) versus debt-securing encumbrances may have interpretative implications for future disclosure requirements. Market participants involved in acquisitions should ensure strict adherence to all disclosure obligations under SAST Regulations to avoid similar enforcement actions.
