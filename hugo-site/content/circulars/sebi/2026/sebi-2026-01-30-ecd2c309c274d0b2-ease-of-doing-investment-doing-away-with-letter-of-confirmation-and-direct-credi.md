title: Ease of Doing Investment – Doing Away with Letter of Confirmation and Direct
  Credit of Securities to Dematerialization Accounts
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued a circular (PR No.10/2026) to simplify the process of crediting securities to investors' demat accounts by eliminating the requirement for Letter of Confirmation (LOC). Under the new framework, RTAs and listed companies will directly credit securities to investors' demat accounts after conducting necessary due diligence. This change applies to investor service requests including issuance of duplicate securities certificates, transmission, transposition, claims from unclaimed suspense accounts, and corporate actions.

## Key Points

- Letter of Confirmation (LOC) requirement eliminated for crediting securities to demat accounts
- RTAs and listed companies will now directly credit securities to investor demat accounts
- Processing timeline reduced from approximately 150 days to 30 days
- Eliminates risks associated with loss or pilferage of LOC
- Applies to investor service requests: duplicate certificates, transmission, transposition, unclaimed suspense account claims, and corporate actions
- LOCs issued before the effective date can continue to be used within prescribed timelines

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has fundamentally changed the securities crediting process by removing the intermediary step of LOC issuance. Previously, the process required:
1. Listed companies/RTAs issue LOC to investors
2. Investors submit LOC to Depository Participant
3. Depository Participant credits securities

Under the revised framework:
1. RTAs and listed companies conduct necessary due diligence
2. Direct credit of securities to investor's demat account

This structural change eliminates the physical LOC document and the associated submission step, streamlining the entire process.

## Compliance Requirements

**For RTAs and Listed Companies:**
- Must implement systems to directly credit securities to investors' demat accounts
- Must conduct necessary due diligence before effecting direct credit
- Must be prepared to process investor service requests under the new framework from April 02, 2026

**For Investors:**
- LOCs issued prior to April 02, 2026 may continue to be used for dematerialization within prescribed timelines
- Future investor service requests will be processed through direct credit mechanism

**For Depository Participants:**
- Must be ready to receive direct credits from RTAs and listed companies
- Must update systems and procedures to accommodate the new process

## Important Dates

- **January 30, 2026**: Circular issued
- **April 02, 2026**: Provisions come into force
- LOCs issued before April 02, 2026 remain valid for use within prescribed timelines

**Operational Impact:**
- 80% reduction in processing time (150 days to 30 days) represents significant operational efficiency gain
