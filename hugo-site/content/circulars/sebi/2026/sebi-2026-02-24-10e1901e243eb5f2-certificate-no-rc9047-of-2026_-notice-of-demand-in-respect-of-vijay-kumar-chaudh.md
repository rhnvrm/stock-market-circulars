  Chaudhary in Illiquid Stock Options Matter
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued a Notice of Demand under Recovery Certificate No. RC9047 of 2026 dated February 2026, against Vijay Kumar Chaudhary (PAN: AFXPC6574P) in connection with the Illiquid Stock Options manipulation matter. This notice directs the respondent to pay outstanding dues as determined in prior SEBI adjudication/recovery proceedings related to the Illiquid Stock Options segment of BSE.

## Key Points

- Recovery Certificate No. RC9047 of 2026 issued against Vijay Kumar Chaudhary (PAN: AFXPC6574P)
- Pertains to the SEBI enforcement action in the matter of Illiquid Stock Options on BSE
- Notice of Demand requires payment of penalty/dues determined in SEBI's earlier adjudication order
- Non-payment may result in further coercive recovery measures including attachment of assets
- Part of SEBI's ongoing mass recovery drive against entities penalised in the Illiquid Stock Options case

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is an individual enforcement/recovery action under existing SEBI (Recovery of Amounts) Regulations and powers granted under the SEBI Act, 1992.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Vijay Kumar Chaudhary** must pay the demanded amount specified in the Recovery Certificate within the stipulated time period
- Failure to comply may lead to attachment of bank accounts, securities, or other assets
- The respondent may approach SEBI for any dispute regarding the quantum or validity of the demand

## Important Dates

- **Recovery Certificate Date:** 2026 (RC9047 of 2026)
- **Notice Issued:** February 24, 2026
- **Payment Deadline:** As specified in the notice (typically 15–30 days from date of demand)

## Impact Assessment

This notice has no broader market impact. It is an individual recovery action targeting a specific person penalised in SEBI's Illiquid Stock Options enforcement matter — one of the largest market manipulation cases in Indian securities markets involving manipulation in the illiquid stock options segment of BSE. The broader case resulted in hundreds of penalty orders; this notice is part of the ongoing recovery phase against non-compliant respondents.
