## Summary

SEBI issued a settlement order (SO/JS/DP/2025-26/8498 and SO/JS/DP/2025-26/8500) against Blue Coast Hotels Limited and its promoter and whole-time director Mr. Kushal Suri. The proceedings arose from the company's failure to provision a contingent liability of Rs. 318.95 Crore related to refunds owed to space buyers in the failed Delhi Aerocity five-star hotel project during financial years 2019 to 2022. NSE's examination report revealed irregularities in financial statements, leading to SEBI's detailed investigation and subsequent adjudication proceedings.

## Impact Assessment

**Financial Impact:** The undisclosed contingent liability of Rs. 318.95 Crore represents a material misstatement in Blue Coast Hotels Limited's financial statements for four consecutive years. This non-disclosure significantly impacted the accuracy and reliability of the company's financial position presented to investors and stakeholders.

**Corporate Governance:** The settlement proceedings against both the company and its promoter/whole-time director highlight serious corporate governance lapses in financial oversight and compliance with accounting standards.

**Investor Impact:** Investors who relied on the financial statements during FY19-FY22 were deprived of material information about a significant contingent liability that could substantially affect the company's financial position.

**Market Integrity:** The case reinforces SEBI's commitment to ensuring accurate financial disclosures and holding companies and their management accountable for violations of disclosure norms.

**Precedent Value:** This order serves as a reminder to listed companies about the importance of properly identifying, evaluating, and disclosing contingent liabilities, particularly those arising from court orders and legal proceedings involving subsidiaries or related entities where the parent company is also a party.
