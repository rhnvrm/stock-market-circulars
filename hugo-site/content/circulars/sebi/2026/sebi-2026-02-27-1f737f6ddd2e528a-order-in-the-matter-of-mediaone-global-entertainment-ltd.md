title: SEBI Order Against Mediaone Global Entertainment Ltd. for Fund Diversion and
  Financial Manipulation
---

## Summary

SEBI has passed an enforcement order against Mediaone Global Entertainment Ltd. (MGEL) and seven of its key managerial persons under Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11(4A), 11B(1), and 11B(2) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Rule 5 of the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995. The action stems from an investigation into Eros International Media Limited (EIML), during which SEBI detected serious irregularities including diversion of funds, manipulation of books of accounts, and falsification of financial statements. A key finding was that EIML wrote off ₹63.61 crore in FY 2019–20 as advances given to MGEL for purported film co-production arrangements — an amount that exceeded MGEL's total asset base at the time.

## Key Points

- SEBI investigated Eros International Media Limited (EIML) and found serious irregularities including diversion of funds, manipulation of books of accounts, and falsification of financial statements.
- EIML wrote off ₹63.61 crore in FY 2019–20 as advances to MGEL for film co-production arrangements.
- The written-off amount exceeded MGEL's total asset base for the relevant period.
- MGEL had reported negligible revenues for several preceding financial years, making the scale of write-off particularly suspicious.
- MGEL is a Chennai-based media and entertainment company providing production support services for films, web series, and TV serials.
- BSE suspended trading in MGEL shares from June 27, 2016 to May 03, 2022 for non-compliance with listing regulations; trading resumed May 04, 2022.
- MGEL was under liquidation per Madras High Court orders dated September 09, 2015 and December 22, 2016; liquidation proceedings were subsequently lifted on January 25, 2023.
- Seven noticees are named: MGEL itself and six individuals including the Managing Director, Whole Time Director, and Independent Directors.

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes are introduced. This is an enforcement action applying existing provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 (Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11(4A), 11B(1), and 11B(2)) and the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995.

## Impact Assessment

This order has significant implications for MGEL and its directors, with potential debarment or other penalties under the SEBI Act. The case highlights SEBI's scrutiny of inter-company fund flows between listed and unlisted entities, particularly where advances are written off without proportionate business activity. Investors in both MGEL and EIML are affected, given the alleged misrepresentation of financial health. The case also signals heightened regulatory attention to the media and entertainment sector for related-party transactions and accounting irregularities. The company's history of trading suspension, liquidation, and now enforcement action reflects persistent governance concerns.
