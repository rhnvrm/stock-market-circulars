## Summary

SEBI issued an adjudication order against Sushil Kumar Saraf (PAN: AKUPS9187L) for violations related to non-genuine trading in illiquid stock options on BSE during April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015. The investigation revealed that Saraf executed reversal trades where buy/sell positions were reversed with the same counterparty, creating artificial volumes and false appearance of trading. This was part of a larger investigation involving 14,720 entities where 2,91,643 trades (81.38% of all stock options trades) were identified as reversal trades. The order was issued under Adjudication Order No. Order/JS/YK/2025-26/31977.

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this is an individual enforcement action for historical violations from 2014-2015. The order is part of SEBI's broader crackdown on illiquid stock options manipulation involving thousands of entities. The case highlights SEBI's continued efforts to prosecute market manipulation even years after occurrence. No immediate operational impact on current market participants, but serves as deterrent against similar manipulative practices in derivatives segments.
