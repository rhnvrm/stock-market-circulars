  Trading at BSE
---

## Summary

SEBI's Adjudicating Officer issued Order No. Order/AK/DS/2025-26/32126 against Salween Securities Private Limited (previously known as Suzlon Securities Private Limited, PAN: AANCS5746H) for its alleged participation in large-scale reversal trading in the illiquid stock options segment of BSE during April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015. The investigation revealed that 2,91,744 trades — comprising 81.40% of all BSE stock options trades during the investigation period — were allegedly non-genuine, resulting in artificial volume creation.

## Key Points

- SEBI investigated large-scale reversal of trades in BSE's stock options segment covering the period April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015
- A total of 2,91,744 trades (81.40% of all BSE stock options trades during the period) were found to be allegedly non-genuine
- Salween Securities Private Limited executed 2 non-genuine trades in 1 stock options contract, creating artificial volume of 40,000 units
- The company was previously known as Suzlon Securities Private Limited
- Adjudication proceedings were initiated for alleged violation of SEBI PFUTP Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a)
- A Show Cause Notice was issued on August 11, 2022 (Ref: SEBI/HO/SEBI/SEBI/P/OW/20220000041286/1)
- The original Adjudicating Officer was Mr. Benoy Melshiyar (appointed September 20, 2021); the undersigned AO was appointed April 03, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is an enforcement action under existing provisions of:
- Section 15-I and Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992
- Rule 5 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995
- Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003

## Compliance Requirements

- The Noticee (Salween Securities Private Limited) is required to respond to the Show Cause Notice and participate in the adjudication inquiry
- Market participants must refrain from executing reversal trades or any trades designed to create artificial volumes in stock options or any other segment
- Entities must ensure all trades are genuine and do not create false or misleading appearance of trading activity

## Important Dates

- **Investigation Period:** April 1, 2014 – September 30, 2015
- **Original AO Appointment:** September 20, 2021
- **Show Cause Notice Issued:** August 11, 2022
- **Current AO Appointment:** April 03, 2025
- **Order Date:** February 18, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This order has limited broader market impact as it pertains to historical violations by a single private limited company involving only 2 non-genuine trades. The significance lies in SEBI's continued enforcement action against participants in the BSE illiquid stock options manipulation scheme, which was a systemic issue affecting 81.40% of all trades in that segment. The order reinforces SEBI's long-term commitment to pursuing fraudulent trading practices even years after the violation period.
