---

## Summary

The SEBI Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6730 of 2026 filed by Ankurbhai Kamleshbhai Shah against CPIO, SEBI, Mumbai. The appellant sought information regarding circulars related to UPI Static Codes for IPO applications (referencing RC 100), including issuance dates and URLs. The CPIO had denied the request on grounds that the queries were unclear and could not be construed as 'Information' under Section 2(f) of the RTI Act. The Appellate Authority upheld the CPIO's response and dismissed the appeal.

- Appellant filed the appeal (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/26/00050) on February 05, 2026 citing refusal of information
- Appellate Authority concurred with CPIO that RTI queries must be clear, specific, and relate to documented information in the public authority's records
- Authority cited precedent: Mr. T. V. Sundaresan vs. CPIO, SEBI (November 24, 2021), affirming that broad, general, or presumptive queries are not disclosable under the RTI Act
- Appellant was directed to SEBI's website where all circulars and master circulars are publicly available
