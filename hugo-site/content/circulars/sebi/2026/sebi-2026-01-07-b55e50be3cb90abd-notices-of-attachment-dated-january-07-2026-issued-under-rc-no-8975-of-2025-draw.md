- Recovery Certificate issued in 2025 (RC No. 8975 of 2025)

## Impact Assessment

**Individual Impact**: High - The defaulter Sheela Saha will face immediate freezing of bank and demat accounts, preventing access to funds and securities. This is a severe enforcement measure that restricts financial transactions until the matter is resolved.

**Market Impact**: Low - This is an individual enforcement action and does not have broader market implications. However, it demonstrates SEBI's continued vigilance in pursuing cases related to illiquid stock option manipulation.

**Regulatory Precedent**: The action reinforces SEBI's commitment to recovering dues from entities involved in market manipulation activities, particularly in the illiquid stock options segment. It serves as a deterrent for similar violations and demonstrates the use of attachment mechanisms as a recovery tool.

**Procedural Note**: The issuance of multiple notices under the same recovery certificate suggests attachment orders may have been directed to multiple financial institutions or depositories where the defaulter maintains accounts.
